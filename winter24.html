            <div class="text-body">So I can actually think for a moment.
                <br>&emsp;Foremost, I wish to have kids. Our desire is not palletable, but our aim is in line with
                our
                natural expectations. Similar to our agreement with death, so do we see children as likely; and to
                such
                presumed end, I am happy, and pleased. As for their rearing, I see simplicity heralding their home
                and
                stead, along with a honorable union with the goods and harmony of the world. I see us rearing them
                to speak
                well and clearly, to listen, to walk, talk, breathe, write and run. And from there, for their own
                application, or
                our shared steps abroad, so we'll be. I understand the pre-requisite of money, in that a room, a
                stroller,
                food and diapers are required. Nor is there a short amount of odd preperations: an emergency, check
                ups,
                glasses, dental. But these are either mended by simpler habits; are not so precarious in their
                acquisition;
                or can be attended to when and on the day. Moreover, the basis for chidlren is a dutiful one; and in
                that,
                our pecuniary needs are oriented to. In that, assuming we have someone who was as interested as I to
                birth
                and raise, and thus share the load of attention and means, that so will we, in our correspoding
                means, have
                likely measures to bend them further, and by that, address any momentary or forseen requirments.
                <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I can say that our draw to this is but a formality. As I do not have a
                spark
                inside me, nor any emebers which our relations are kindling. All it seems, is that on this path we
                stand,
                akin to death. The mode of our life is such, that progress, the abscence of contributing a new
                member, and
                our otherwise prior interests, leads me not but to a proprtioned conclusion. Namely, that of our
                life, in
                its investment and regard, ought it be, in expectation and according preference, tailored with such
                points
                in mind. Our regard is not so heavy though, for such a path is not mighty in its horizon. "For we
                may then
                see, with proper deeds and response; nor can we offer but a little preperation; as such matters are
                by
                nature, laid out."
                <br>&emsp;What is right and wrong then is not, in this case, guilded by any sense that we ought have
                children now, or shortly. There's no civil or customary need for us to do so. And indeed, little of
                such
                sentiment is ever pressed upon me.
                <br>&emsp;Oddly though, I think that our happiness is the lever by which others express themselves:
                for in
                that, in cheer and candour, they wish. Yet the irony, is that what said happiness amounts to is not
                so
                clear, except what I can only pin point as a basic need to be true to those future points of
                children and
                death.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, we tend to recieve suggestions along the lines of that which would furnish me
                with
                fortune and friends. Namely, that of a bigger house, and a acceptable sociallife.
                <br>&emsp;For one, these remarks feel unfiltered or assessed; as no one ever asks you if you are
                really
                happy. At least, if they do, there is seldom an agreement on what such happiness means. For even if
                I am,
                and then begin to slip, the resorted expression is one of ventures for the sake of things esteemed
                to make
                you happy. But our prior happiness, as we politely claimed, is not concluded as being poor in
                princiuple,
                but rather futily achieved.

            <div class="text-body">
                So their are two main elements: duty and happiness. The form of the latter is all that's worth
                remarking,
                while the former is guilded by our baser needs, and the mode theiracquired.
                <br>&emsp;Surrounding this though is the direction of our lives. For what we need is not so ardently
                agreed
                upon. Nor, is the form of happiness heralded in terms of propiety, or even merrit. "Which is to say,
                that
                the matter of happiness, be it crumby or pure, may not be deeemd important, or appropriate even: as
                duty may
                hold the our deepestcare."
                <br>&emsp;In that, it is quite easy to say that our desired form, is one where the good we
                experience is
                ocnsistent, merrily met, and of a wholesome sort; as to accomodate such qualities, whilst also being
                tender,
                warm and sweet. Nor are we given much more difficulty in saying that our needs are so as would make
                us
                secure; that if we had some thing, that we would be full, fed and sure. Moreover, we might say, that
                our
                means to such things is done via ourselves or some collective: and that at some extent of the latter
                is
                society made, and an according economoy where our particulare actions within the efficiencies of the
                whole,
                treats us to a return in which we can apply to such products of the whole.
                <br>&emsp;None of this is hard tosay.
                <br>&emsp;But that we ought fear our dreasm, as if some messenger is suggesting something; be it of
                fear or
                oppertunity. Or whether or not our foresight of death is one that speaks of peace and certain
                finality, or
                rather shines upon us with some promise; one of which we can see, relish in, and from there
                anticpate, but
                also surrender to and oblige, as pertains to esteemed requisites for entry. These things, alongside
                many
                others --in both identities and meaning- are not so clear.
                <br>&emsp;Where I sit then is in a state of private confidence. A state of which, by all things
                likely, I am
                not deterred or afraid by what is apt to come. And as such, I may personally be, in the moment
                happily, and
                sturdy to the future tocome.
                <br>&emsp;But a matter of deep importance remains. One of which characteries the nature of a
                species, and by
                that, a feature which nearly all living things share: progeny.
                <br>&emsp;For these remarks of ours are not merely attributions to mysteries ahead of us, but also
                matters
                of the dearest concern; for upon our natural stride, whereby another is birthed upon us, that so in
                our
                provision of security and happiness (for them), do these obscurities lay. Our time is admittedly
                garnished
                by age and sensibility. And despite our contemporary release from primitive views and superstition,
                so are
                we are least sure and bounded by the strenght in our appraoch, to whichever future lays. One's
                parenting
                though is not, in general, or in any particularly esteemed way, propitiated by such confidence. For
                we may
                raise them to be a strong as us, whereupon they approach the mysteriees of life with equal might and
                gust.
                But so are we playing with the roots of another, as opposed to our own secure trunk. For we can
                already see,
                think, consider and align. Our child though is relying on us to do much of this for them. And
                whether it is
                our action they need, or mere guidance, so mustn't we compare our relation to the world to their
                own.

                It is hard not to say, that akin to a headache, or an injury, that whatever relieved it now, would
                trump all
                other matters. Nor would other things be given muchregard.
                <br>&emsp;Our mind is thus not very clear, as we have been sleeping late, and not exercising. These
                are not
                from bad habits mind you, but a whithering of our good ones. The principles to be fair regarding
                such
                efforts are not in themselves poor. But our general momentum has been tilted from the recent months;
                nor
                have the principles had time to settle and embellish themselves. This is indeed the flow of ourlife.
                <br>&emsp;In that, all that matters is our time ahead. Nearby, I see the oppertunity to find some
                security,
                in that we may work at Walmart or Superstore. This will be nice, and indeed is neccessary to stay
                comfortably at home. I cannot say this will procure stability though. At least, in our muddied
                state, I can
                see that our time at home will not produce what we seek further ahead. Indeed, our muddiedness does
                not let
                us be content with what we have; for if we were, then such far off things would not be either
                hankered
                towards, nor with grievence at their distance.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, it is an akward time, as I am not so privy to communicate: it being the holidays
                afterall.
                Despite that, we've made three attempts thus far, each ending in a miss. I don't fear the clock in
                regards
                to a potential leave in Februrary; but knowing if our course is such would be nice to know.
                Especially so we
                may communicate and come to an understanding. Dad is leaving in a few days for Palm Springs, as is
                Mom
                leaving for Kamloops. And so the months end will come, and we may potentially be going. Right now
                though, I
                am not sure what we're going to do. I fret not at the choices, only that I am both lingering or
                halted from
                learning about the one I oughtmake.
                <br>&emsp;I say we phone as we can. I would rather work at West Walmart, but East or Superstore will
                do. My
                stake in them saying yes, albeit a nice turn of events, is not so tight. In fact, I think it in many
                ways
                wrong. If we were more secure, through ourselves, then the comfort and harmony would be alright. I
                might
                even lean in and find some steadyness. But I know in my heart, nor am excused form the thought upon
                any
                personal waiving, that somewhere else is where I'm meant togo.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, I mean to invest myself. If only because there is oppertunity and need to do
                so. Such
                needs are small, nor is their prescence near. But the stability of our life is such, that in terms
                of the
                happiness which we seek, ought we be on route, or in line at least, to something which our happiness
                woudl
                be find to float towards. We need not rush, but our personal efforts relish the liberty to sink into
                themselves; but such an agreement comes when your foresight is checked by appropriate actions. What
                this
                deems then, is not so much that we would reach forward with haste, or be trepidatious so long as we
                weren't
                now as we see to be latter, rather that we were merely on course, directed, and set to reach such
                end by our
                natural paces. This is why we felt the need to leave home in Kamloops, as we knew that our time
                there was
                not so kept. And despite being happy, I found it hard to sink in and be truly so; for I knew change
                was
                coming. Such change though comes from a sort of honesty to what is required to stability. I don't
                seek
                children, but I do recognize our future place with them. The slightest bit of current happiness is
                enough
                not to worry about that; but as even one string of our current peace is tugged at, so does our
                apparent
                incongruety with such future become apparent.

                So a mistake was once made. It occured when we choose to leave our post, of which our later
                reflections
                would reveal to have been prosperous. But in any case, we left, and moved north to a comfortable
                home.
                Indeed cicrumstance was what called us. But our willingness to go was far too keen and excitable
                than our a
                call for dutyreflected.
                <br>&emsp;In this, I have learned that happiness is not some hidden treause, laid upon broken glass
                and
                smolten steel. As Montainge says, 'it lies out in the open, pleased to be treated (and thus
                beneovlent) by
                any who would take her hand'. I can't quite say when this remark came to pass, but I do recall
                thinking that
                our congruency with the world, or affibility at least, in terms of our 'hand to happiness', was
                neither
                unacceptibility, or with much difficulty to manifest. I have learned things, and indeed, our
                adolscence has
                lost its youtfull edge. But I mention this only to highlight our naivety and slant of incongruence,
                with
                respect to our being happy in a worldy way. For I do submitt that our views on this matter were not
                so open
                or admitted in times past; where we were either agasint the common way, leary about our place in it,
                and at
                any rate resolved to live outside of it, or merely to the extent required. "I seldom thought,
                outside of
                wishes and fancy, that I would freely and fullystride."

                So the strides of our life are duly met by circumstance. The weather, for instance, changes the day,
                which
                then changes the days ahead of that; which in effect, contributes to the periodcoming.
                <br>&emsp;Our resolve though is merely to learn, so that when it rains, or time has come with her
                many
                demands, we may fruitfullyoblige.
                <br>&emsp;In this, I know foremost that our happiness needs rest. From this though, there lies the
                trouble
                in ceasing acitivity, for the external motions of your life are leaned on, as is your own liberty to
                breathe, and be. In many ways, I could describe this mode as one of stability and progress. For my
                home does
                come into question; whereby the extent to which I can see, by virtue of our stability, bears upon me
                a
                horizon which my rest is not angst to reach. For the alternative is one, whereup you become still,
                see
                little, and feel like little is shown ahead: whereby you wish to further yourself. In line with
                that, is the
                sentiment of progress. Rest does not exclusivley fall on this notion, as our working stress and
                occupied
                place, may also wish for some promise ahead. This is merely an eligibility though, or rather some
                sense of
                oppertunity which your natural strides can meet. For I do not neccesarily need that which said
                promise would
                bring, rather that our current path, as ordained and still, will naturally reach; be it through a
                means or
                the concurentend.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, I fret not over things I wish to have; nor do I even humour them, as I know in
                principle, and in awareness of the tamber of the desire, that such things are not worth much. By
                that
                though, in all things appropriate, I may still try. Not fretlesslessly for grifted success, but
                rather for
                things which we have no recourse to not. The point, is that in the case for work, I may ask, as such
                success
                would be something were gratefull toward. But we already have much. And my starting point ought to
                have
                been, that what we have is not the primary matter, rather our use of things. It is like someone in
                water who
                was born to be in such, who seeks for more, of a quality kind let's say; but this is merely an
                addition, an
                arrangment or cirucmstnace; for your being is already one and with water. And swimming then is the
                crucial
                matter. And indeed, working at superstore would give us a bucket full; nor would walmart fail to
                give me a
                pale's worth. But our swimming will only come so far. As we will still be in this relatively small
                pond, no
                matter how much more it is filled up.

                Our truest desire is akin to a meal, whereby the taste of the food was not only relevant, but our
                company,
                the lighting, even the breakfast early in the day. All things work this way for me, and as such, our
                life
                being swell, is but an aggregrate of all good things blending together to form a delivioushole.
                <br>&emsp;I need only mention each one then, with some relations which would elevate our interest.
                <br>&emsp;For one, Civ is coming out. And despite our recent flatness, so has our curiosity began to
                peak;
                all in part because our consumption of it through the fall had died down. When I see our scenario
                though, I
                see the possibility of moving, and the quandery of finding work from that. The game comes out a
                month from
                now, so our ability to anticiapate comes in conflcit with our apprhensiosn aod or preperation of our
                time
                ahead. This in many ways is the key reason I'd like to stay at home, and rightly. For Diablo is also
                coming
                out. Admittedly, prior to anything that would technically happen; but so is the good I see a little
                capped
                by not being able to seefurther.
                <br>&emsp;In that, I can say, that what I seek is stability. I want to imagine ourselves working
                from home,
                or training to be in IT, or running a creator buisness. I also wish to find some commradery in our
                teamates,
                showing up on a regular basis, feeling that there is somewhere for us to be. This sens of
                contentment,
                whether it is in line for future investement or pure content, so would it please me to bear some
                union
                between our intent and that of which our parents see. For they do not know that I agree to the
                potential for
                chidlren; and that seeing so, I only would care for one; or that I have such concerns for education.
                That,
                and my care for travel is not something I attest. For any feeling for it, or excitement, similar to
                other
                anticpations which furnish everything else, so do I see these cares for aborad to be but sparks from
                our
                seperated self; whereby nothing near or dear is close, nor something fair and hearty further seen.
                And I
                wish for them to hear this; nor do I want any pity, suggestion, our doubt as regards any esteem or
                ability
                to travel. "I wish not for their rose tainted appeals or support."
                <br>&emsp;What I want overall is a place where I no longer see, but happily am. I will endure,
                embrace,
                steady and raise. But so would I care for somewhere that I saw progress and habitiation as our path,
                rather
                than dreams, reservation, justification or conquest, born from a spot of comfort and flow.
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, the core of our desires is in being able enough to be and set, as to
                properly
                engrain and sprout in our reflective way. For only is that the way for truth and measure, moral and
                ground.
                We need no other. And indeed, our experiene of this, by the virtue of principle in our temporary
                states,
                speaks to me as something which holds the evident promise of growth; but also a contrary brace to
                our
                otherwise whims and discontent: of which comes by the nature of that temporary post. "Our principle
                merely
                brings the iteration of our place to a close, and makes what comes to be a upper portion of the
                wave,
                seemingly all there is: by which I act, reflect and be." Thereupon I grown, learn and beckon, as to
                choose
                where I'll further move to. Only, the crux of our adolescent lives, is in living so purely, albeit
                with a
                bulge, in that sheltered peak, that so is the lesson worth decidiing from not one which is laid for
                the gain
                of such peak, but the lands beneath us: where right livinglies.

                So exercise is exercise, as is stretching. But food is always a source of discretion; as you may
                care
                little, or a lot, and the selection for your choices is never soclear.
                <br>&emsp;I can say, in terms of stretching, I would like to further our roster. Our hips have
                recieved good
                work in the recent month, and our shoulders have had some nice treatment; but indeed our chest and
                spine
                need more work, along with our legs.
                <br>&emsp;Regarding food then, I feel a little famoished. This cannot be overlooked as a reason not
                to forgo
                exercise; for even upon doing that once, I feel stronger. So the balance of our needs is such that
                our
                improvement in exercise will equate.
                <br>&emsp;I would say then that food is so unclear, for its purpose is merely associative, in that
                it
                supports your activity. By that, our interest is to play some Diablo, watch some videos and Clone
                Wars, edit
                some music and our website, walk, stretch, and do some running and pushups. Doing the latter
                definitely
                brings me into a compressed state, initially at least. So having something for that, in both comfort
                and
                recovery is usefull.
                <br>&emsp;It is suppose to be a bit warmer tomorrow and Sunday, and less of a downpoor; then it is
                not
                suppose to rain for a few days. I mean to do some more pushups, despite the risk of comrpession.
                This
                benefits most from a lack of firm activity. Getting out then is nice, and food motivates this.
                Perhaps we
                can go to Fresh Co (and if not Superstore) Sundany evening.
                <br>&emsp;This leaves us with needs for today and tomorrow. Bulk wise, we have plenty of grain
                --though we
                do need to cook barley. "Our soup is quite salty, so prior to butter, and large amounts, just use it
                as a
                seasoner to your grain." We have no oranges or kale, so we'll get those. Nor are there bananas.
                Bread wise
                we have bagels for tonight, and some whole wheat bread. We can grab some E.muffins on Sunday.
                Protein wise
                we have little, thought Quinoa is fine. I reckon that tomrrow, if not Sunday afternoon, will hold
                the
                compressed effects (if and any) from tomorrows session. So some Tofu would be nice.
                <br>&emsp;Our recent efforts have turned me to calcium pills; though their bulk content of other
                viatmins
                makes it quite difficult to process. The perill of not doing so is not present; though I am fully
                aware that
                we are not drinking soy any more. I am not sure I wish to do so on a consistent basis. Nor is almond
                milk
                pleasing, or accessible, as you must replensih twice per week. The vitamins are relatively cheap and
                last
                for long. Perhaps we could forgo all things unessential, and choose gummies for easier digestion.
                <br>&emsp;As it stands, our midday has switched from smoothies to bananas, seeds and dried fruit.
                This has
                worked well, but the stretch by which were satiated seems shorter. Normally, we'd have a smoothie
                and bu
                full till dinner. Whereas now, were quite bare by the later afternoon. Exercise may have something
                to do
                with this, as our preferreed schedule would see some roughage and fruit had early in the day. "We
                also have
                several apples, which can serve our eveningventures."
                <br>&emsp;All in all, Kale, oranges, a few bananas, 1 tofu and some dried fruit, will set us for the
                days.
                We'll get some dinner on Sunday, and treat ourself to the tofu; and we'll get more bread or
                essentials then.
                Our soup is full, and we can make Barley and lentils for ittoday

                So I seek no child. Simply, I am already fine, pleased and happy. Our choices have not faciliated
                deep
                stability, nor the comfort and growth which all people seek. But our actions are quite good, and our
                abscence of bad one's keeps mehappy.
                <br>&emsp;Oppertunity wise, I am not inclined to derail and or abate our current happiness. Such a
                sentiment
                falls on the dearness to certain things. These things are in need of their own attention, as in the
                actual
                moves in a dance, and that of provision, as to smoothly satiate our needs. Taking further steps, be
                it in
                investment or employment, have some promise, and eligbility to be equitable to our dearer ways. But
                I find
                their worth to be somewhat novel, and based on the future, rather than the present --as we can
                concieve of
                as being. And, as such, I find that our resistance to not seeing such horizon is one where we are
                simply
                obliged to be more present and clear now: which is not an easy thing to: for you must think, be
                honest, iron
                out your divots and holes: and by that token, submitt to theirprescence.
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, our unease at merely being happy, comes down to the steadyness by which we
                consider
                being so. For such remarks are in practice, beyond us, and at that, of a future which further dreams
                compare. This is why we write, as we are trying to be honest, and reach out for the light near us,
                and
                simply remedy the shortness of warmth: whereby we then color our ends with the dreams were
                experiencing,
                near and now, as if we were pleased with our liberty, to be moral andmodern.

                then so can't we find harmony with them: to which we nerously approach. Indeed, others may rustle

                <br>&emsp;But, due to normal needs, and corresponding amends, so may we rest on approach to such by
                the
                actions we know we'll take: ones which we can also remark upon ourarrival.
                <br>&emsp;Simply, the matter here is one of negativity, whereby we see a threat, in terms of some

                may actually benefit from these means, be it in baser elements, or those of color and spring. And of
                the
                groove which sprouts amidst this centered stone, so may the land rise, by which you see thehorizon.

                So we have our duty coming. All in all, if I were King, proposed, and with expressive fortune, than
                the
                manner of such oblige would not thwart me. And even if it was deemed to be somewhat negativie, so
                would the
                reason for it bear meagainst.
                <br>&emsp;But, as it were, it feels like were doing this for an unknown reason. Despite this feeling
                arbitrary and contrived, I can see that there is an ultiamteprinciple.
                <br>&emsp;Yet, said course of action holds with it very little animation to such principle. All it
                really
                amounts to is our progeny, our leadership and or expression. I cannot see where these things lie
                though. As,
                our insight is such, that of our common course, where the paces are liberal and rich, so do we
                naturally
                proceed, and by thave, have a sort brim cheer as we approach whatever's ahead. Only, when duty
                comes, or
                friction at that, we tend to loose our sight, and beckon to the obscurity by which we are either a)
                obliged
                for such principle, or b) destined for such, for which said principle is attested to, and our duty a
                stable
                means for so.
                <br>&emsp;Bringing this all in, we have our happiness, and of an abundant sort. And from this, is
                where I
                see. Though, all the likely born from the still present deeds upon us; only, by the times and our
                sensibility, we simply had more room and means to be so inclined. Yet, the limits of that, and
                pressures,
                still brought me to be so principally inclined.

                So dreams come because we are undoutdedely stressed. Nature is ever upon us. I don't see this as
                some
                seperation, as if wind upon rock was a dual matter. But I do see, that, by the whims of the whole,
                or
                however you'd state it, that so must we attend to our basic deed: breathe, eat, sleep, rest,
                survive. These
                all come about because we are inbued with pleasure and pain. Across the range of these, we tend to
                predict
                and anticiapate for the sake of.
                <br>&emsp;As children we are not less filled with obligations than those of us older. The form is
                different,
                but we are still equally in thedomain.
                <br>&emsp;I say this, for one may think, in privalage or congruency, that they may be absent of such
                conditions, and by that, free to experience all that they seek. There is merrit to this, but the
                sentiment
                needs a strongerstatement.
                <br>&emsp;Simply, as we grasp for breathe, so do we perk up at the sun's shine. This is akin to our
                awareness of threats, or ease upon a coming relief. Happiness is merely this forrayed into an
                positive
                abundance. Whereby, those things which spark our less than begrieved minds, are seen, sought and
                attended
                to. "I can say that our past has dealt us a rich hand in these regards. But so do I sulk a little at
                this
                state of mind being disturbed. Besides the lapse of such goods, the blurr of our sight of them is
                what
                brings me down themost."

                So I woke up a nearly 330 --and admittedly, it was a slight bit before that. I can't say exactly,
                but I fell
                asleep around 7, meaning we had a full sleep. For one, a full sleep, compared to 6 or 7 hours, seems
                all the
                difference between good and bad living. Moreover, achieving this ought be done so thorugh earlier
                sleep,
                rather than sleeping in later.
                <br>&emsp;At any rate, I would love to wake up at 5:00 on the regular. Today felt like it went by
                blazing
                fast; and despite that, we felt cool and collected, and sure as well. I'd say going to be around 8
                seems the
                best. At least, no more eating, or screen time. Just walk, stretch, read and rest. Perhaps we won't
                be as
                tired. But I'd still benefit from waking earlier, and letting our appropriate bedtime be sooner.
                Last I
                checked, it was noon oclock, and now were reaching 2. But its near time for dinner, and we have so
                much room
                to go. Our days in fact feel longer and all aroundbetter

                One of the realities of living with other people, is that they are going to do things which are
                either a)
                annoying, or b) contemptible. Partciualarly, with family, this sense will be magnififed, as such
                things will
                feel worse coming from you, nor so easily communicated. "Things thusharbour."
                <br>&emsp;But the relaity is that our discontent with such matters, no matter the degree, come from
                an
                unsteadyness in ourself. Namely, that we have no real grasp on things, and are thus unerved by
                things which
                press upon us; as we have no natural press, nor sturdy grounds forbracing.
                <br>&emsp;I'll say then, that our life is such, that of a sort of flow, we are going into one of
                stability.
                It cannot be overlooked that this state will include work and self-provision. But it is also so
                different
                from every other moment of our life. The main difference being, that our conditions were self
                imposed, via
                our interests and creativity, and the normal arrangment with your family, and the encumbent, and
                generally
                seen, foresight of our future success and oblige. Our current moment is merely brining things to
                light, so
                that our stability is born from us, and thus held by our amends. Nor, compared to the scorn and
                weariness of
                dependance, we may rightly and fully address our life and ways. This is no poor matter, and as so,
                we may
                clearlyattend.
                <br>&emsp;For starters, we are always conditioned. And our sense that something is wrong, stems from
                the
                fact that our place in such condition is either unappreciated, or immature. As all, in slavery or
                kingship,
                naturally instatiate themselves to their position; whereby the trouble of it becomes adapted to, as
                do their
                strenghts rise over the weight of the request; nor do the rewards stay flat, as your mere prescence
                tends to
                bring more reward, if not familiarity and the according satisfaction. Nor, in the things beyond this
                post,
                where our postive concerns are drawn, are we so blinded and or hampered to such sights, and by that,
                witheld
                to attend. "And there lies hope, to which this calm sea, in all its tides and ripples, elevates the
                basiclevel."
                <br>&emsp;In this way, I am grappling with the objects which my unadorned mind seeks; and whether
                such
                things ought guide me, and thus become our ends in sight. For such matters, in all the prescence,
                tend to
                linger infront us when we have stopped; but our sight of them prior was one that was at that point
                ahead; as
                in our fuller strides, we naturally saw the road ahead, and where our heart was taking us. Indeed,
                these
                moments held objects of mere sentiment, in that a future of sacrifice and contribution were gleemed.
                Only,
                now as our ordinary way has halted, or at least settled, into moments of indolence or rest, so are
                we
                without a clear horizon: in decleration or senitment.
                <br>&emsp;My feeling remains though, that the latter notion is one that marks the proper form of
                things. For
                our remarks of the former bring with them a sort of grasping breathe, as the nature of our indolence
                suggests. And so I heed these not, for the objects deemed are so, and in that esteemed, 'by our
                halted
                state'. And the according feeling that we ought, and pleasingly so, amend, is not so fair or valid,
                in that
                such ends are concieved and validated by our own lacking: rather than a relation born from solid
                grounds,
                and thus clear sight. "Were reaching in one, and merely open to the other. As if we are trying to
                come back
                to the world, whereby we strike a thin line; to which entry point holds the only insight to the
                world we
                see. While our other way, sees us already near and dear to the world, in all her grace and entirety.
                And
                happily, we see ourselves striding towards cleaningup."

                I am a little to idle to say much more than the purest remark. Which is, I have no desire for
                children. Nor
                do I recognize much interest in me, besides a sentiment of dreams and or conjuration (as to
                anticapte). I
                will admitt that during I finer strides, which are not so constant as to be solid until a discrete
                change,
                that within the dips and tides of such finer periods (we'll say), so do I recognize there a heartier
                view of
                such ends. In all fairness, this sentiment only occurs as a sort of validation, and or assurance as
                to
                something ahead. The difference being in times of more hollow moments during our better days, and
                the wholer
                future I see, and what I see during our truly idle times: whereby all but the suns light gleams so
                harsh
                upon me, that regards for a child are the next best thing to planning on reaching themoon.
                <br>&emsp;In any case, my solice here is one that permitts recogniton of that natural course. But it
                is not
                a course which I am thrilled to be on, or at any rate, meet. And although these recent days have
                shown me
                the fair exepectaion of such ends, and the good in sturdying our course for such, I still see that
                most of
                what I seek is not so ingrained to such acceptence, but rather the motions of art and leisure, and
                by that,
                the according dreams and futility.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, as those latter swellings have whithered off, so have we felt a little bare in our
                purities. Which is to say, that amidst our purities, in their whole and hearty ways, there lies a
                man
                content with such, and by that, without much care or contention around him. Time has shown her way
                though,
                and brought me to a understandble rebuke, in that, for ends I seek -and the according fancy- or
                those which
                have some regard for what is likely, and if not tradiotnally (and as much common), that so ought I
                be better
                in my amends; for so much of our time is spent living privately, or at least enclosed. And for some
                time
                this served our aim of improvment. But as those years have worn off, and we are now at most
                remembering the
                good in being as we improved, so am I left with the honest remark that our inconstancy is born, by
                choices
                that have made us ill-equiped or fit for such being.
                <br>&emsp;My point overall comes from this, in that, of children, or contribution, so do these lay
                as
                laudible points of that improved path. But as things, and our view of them, so are they gleamed from
                the
                stance of such being. And such a stance, in all honesty, sees with it a need to settle into our rich
                and
                gradual path. One of which, in all fairness, sees where we are lacking in terms of those natural
                ends. For
                however likely, we may have little sense or idea about how to approach them. That we'd reach them,
                and
                strive for them at that, is not something which needs change. But for such important deeds, as would
                become
                of such ends, so doth our potential occurence with them reveal the quality of our view and
                understanding of
                them.

                For most my life I've been obsinate. The only time I was ever free was when I was running around,
                playing
                with myfriends.
                <br>&emsp;I never knew many girls, and seldom would they run with us.
                <br>&emsp;Our life was never an issue this way, as we were solid, tough, strong. Indeed, we often
                got into
                trouble. But welearned.
                <br>&emsp;What I can remember though, is that upon our youthful age, life became somewhat tilted,
                setting
                onto a point which was not so much about satisfaction and joy, but comfort and fun. We were no
                longer
                running around, seeking the mere prescence of friends. But rather hanging out, and at that,
                appearing
                places. I never liked this.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, our shift into youth saw us ingratitated to such a flow of life. But in all
                fairness,
                it was still of an age where all the tits and tats were done at school. Indeed, we would stay around
                after,
                and there were the inklings of hanging out later than that. But for the most part, not much had
                changed.
                When we shifted to fully into youth though, it was clear that we were in line with such matters in
                their
                fullest expression.
                <br>&emsp;In all honesty, the conduct of these ways was not so heavily attuned as my remarks may
                suggest.
                For the flair of things which I cared little for was centered around school, and not so much
                afterwards.
                That is, during recess for instance, there were kids who played soccer, or on the field at least,
                and those
                who stood near the school, in a huddle, full of girls and boys, puffing themselves up, chatting,
                rumouring
                around. I was so opposed to this. In comparison to the similar scenario the time prior, I was
                naturally at
                the heart of it. While in this circumstance --having switched schools-- we were near the outer ring.
                And
                sitting there, appearing present, was just stupidlyoff.
                <br>&emsp;For whatever reason, my entire youth was spent orbiting this arrangment. Only, my care for
                it was
                critical, and full of timid scrutiny. The idea of being so prevalent was something which had me
                blush, or at
                least shy away from. "And like someone young and in love, but embarrassed by it, 'I equally said
                such things
                were stupid'."
                <br>&emsp;In this way I isolated myself. For I did not change our path, and find other places to be,
                or
                people to be around. Or at any rate, as I have become in my current life, I did not finely amend to
                myself,
                and cultivate that. Which is to say, that in all the stupidity I saw around, I did not foster myself
                in our
                place outside of it, as to be a better version of myself in suchplace.
                <br>&emsp;I must remark though, that despite our aversion to group sentiment and mentality, I did
                have great
                friends. I recalll one who I had never met prior to beginning our highschool year, and he and I
                shared all
                our classes, and time together. And beyond that, whether I naturally settled in with my classmates,
                I always
                had a good friend or two. And surely one of them was the best, and one who I spent much of my time
                outside
                of school with. For some reason the interests we had at that age, playing games, eating food and
                staying up
                late, was not something I sought to share with a bundle of people. Especially when I was older, but
                so in
                general, this sort of experience felt diluted; either in the enjoyment I would get, as expressing
                myself
                felt so crowded out; or, the intent I had, or care for the things at hand, lost their focus and
                attention.
                And overall, I just never enjoyed 'hanging out', in that we'd just bro around, through jabs at
                eachother and
                what not. I always preferred the actual activity, be it soccer, a hike, a game, or a film. And for
                my whole
                life I have either gone where I could do so to a solitary degree, or with a small amount of folk, or
                mere
                friend, who would share said activitiy withme.
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, my life has been such, that circumstance has taken me away from what I know,
                and
                thus offered me only the easier task of mingling with groups of people; and not so much the longer
                task of
                making a dearer friend. Indeed, moving to Pitt Meadows did this; for depsite making good friends,
                our choice
                of highschool was detterred by our sentiment regarding the people I'd see myself going with. For
                that, I
                went somewhere other. And indeed, highschool felt even more pitched in its group mentality; beyond
                the
                little nooks of closer friends that is. But for whatever reason, our life was such, that of our view
                and
                course in life, so was it not inclined or appropriate to the norms around; and all the likely
                because the
                dreams and assurance we had, was built on finer cares and principles, rather than those of young
                flirty men.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, our natural path was so, that based on the prolonged stay at school, we
                naturally
                incorporated ourselves into more people; and at that, invited interests by others. Early in our
                years, this
                process highlighted our immaturity and ways. For in grade 9, two girls showed interest in me, one
                doing so
                with near explicity. And I shrugged it off, feeling either nervous, embarrassed, or afraid. Simply,
                my 'shy'
                critique of things, in the depths of me we'll say, manifested in this rerpoach from my parents:
                regarding
                girls in particular. And so despite feeling fine to be invovled with someone at school, I just felt
                so
                averse to their invovlement; so much so, that in that explicit case, I said no. "I reckon, that as I
                saw
                much of the puffiness and confidence of people around, that so was our contrast to that something
                which I
                felt my parent's exasterbated." For one the key marks, is that our aversion to getting invovled with
                someone
                was that it would bring us into the sight of others. In this case, the girl was of a prominent sort.
                And so
                my sentiment was that if we got invovled, I would either a) become situated in the tits and tats of
                all her
                friends, or b) feel strange and awkward at holding myself back, 'while she otherwise explains my
                oddities to
                them: making exucese for my lack ofincorporation'.
                <br>&emsp;In any case, this pace of life was brought to our crucial defeat. For life had whithered
                my down a
                little, in its wants and needs from me. So much so, that depsite our consistent lameness, we filled
                out a
                little, becoming more confident and 'socially tuned'. Yet, despite becoming naturally invovled with
                other
                people, I still did not have the bones to back it up. We found ourselves in a rich scenario, and a
                disagreement arose; we mispoke, and became seperated from the group. Directly and not, our closer
                relations,
                'of those we sat nearest at the group table', left my side also --out of vehemence or happen chance.
                And I
                was left all alone, mad, depressed; but also obstinate, and in such a way that I appointed myself to
                greater
                actions and success. "A sort of 'screw you' attiude; of such a fuel at least, whereby we were
                desperately
                motivated to dowell."

                So we've mentioend alpha 9 before, it being a colony out in the vastness of the Perseus. The planet
                is
                small, and without much vegetation. There is water, and by that, condensation; so that it rains, and
                snows.
                The tectonic activity has created mountains in the north, and great deserts in the south. Notably,
                they have
                massive purple hued crystals sticking out of them.
                <br>&emsp;One of the reasons that the northwest was chosen, particularly in the gratient flat, is
                that
                aestheically and suitbaly, the place delights. In the north, runs a belt of mountains; pearing out
                into the
                western sea, too the easter edge, where mount cushing lies. "And beyond that, there appears flat
                lands and
                litte islands dotting the eastern sea." The flat runs down from these mountains, and runs many miles
                south.
                Whereby the land begins to dip, 'to which the in the distance the crystal desert lies'.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the expidtion was banked on the richness of its inhabitants lives. Notably, so
                that
                they may stability and happily flourish, 'whereby their minds may be drawn and nourished, and
                prompted with
                a sense worth blinking back toearth'.
                <br>&emsp;That being so, the gratient flat was such, that room was held for several hundred people.
                Hoom was
                built with state of the art technology, namely a reproductive line of machinery, whereby offspring
                could be
                produced. "Indeed the matter of children reamins an unclear matter." At any rate, the aim of the
                colony was
                to live well, and from there, have the lasting means to naturally and or unaturally persist; but all
                the
                likely exist initially in the greatest way.
                <br>&emsp;As such, the flat was choosen because of its relation to the mountains, the western sea
                and its
                beach, the relative height compared to lower flats in the east, and that in the south. Simply, it
                was an
                unremarkably flat area of land, near the ocean, with views of the mountains, and enough space to
                warrant
                such delights. One of the initial initiaivtes was to cultivate the land. Namely, in that via the
                prescence
                of water, and the resource machinery on Hoom, the 'soil' naturally found in the ground, could be
                made
                harvestable. "Indeed, much of the settlements layout, as remarks beatuy, service and production, has
                been
                written in the policiesbound."
                <br>&emsp;The heart of this story though, is that earth, in her mid century flair, is a little
                riged.
                Indeed, her modern style has grown out of the antiquate ways of the century prior. But still, she
                beckons to
                the past, in all the cracks and scarss which the annals have dealt. Her remarks are not seen as
                detrimental
                though, as in past expressions. Rather, she is merely stable, yet in a wobbly way. She still lacks a
                purpose, an aim, some sense of how she'll forever be. Her subjects are of a fair sort, in that the
                barbarity
                and pundancy they embellished has but a lingering claim. But of those nearly modern, or variedly
                natural, so
                are they few and far between. Admittedly, all have the bones of this, and are not such of the
                characters
                millenai prior. But of something defined and elegant, so in the richness of peace and happiness,
                they are
                not. "They are but a bit more humble, a bit less clad, nor bigoted. Nor are they as mundane in their
                freedoms, nor indulgrent. There just lacks something comparable to that which those primtiavely
                espused; a
                certainty, some principle, a soldity of living which is both felicituous and moral." And of those on
                alpha
                9, alike those sent further about, so are they all set to enliven such ends, 'and beam back
                something which
                worthy of earth'sbound'.

                So I don't mean to degrade those I'm speaking for. For truly, my dissent of them is more a remark of
                my
                ill-fit for such ways; and of ways which are a mirror to certain virtues. "Being so shy, and
                proclaiming
                thing's I'm nervous about to be stupid, is no good remark ofme."
                <br>&emsp;But I will say, that for all it's worth, I have never ceased this commision to the good,
                and,
                through our youth, an aversion to all things I esteemed not as so. Indeed I took this overboard; at
                least my
                weakness' became backers to my judgement. But still, I maintain that the crux of those ways, in
                group
                interest and broader tradition, is not becoming of what I seek, or of what I find comparable to the
                experiences I find dear. "It is so, that our weakness', however present, were not so by pure
                foundation, but
                application: and our resolve was no pitched to be so prominent, due to the feeble ends Isaw."
                <br>&emsp;My aim here is not to critique. My adolescent has held nothing but that. Instead, I would
                simply
                remark that of this way, be it with merrit or some sourced preference, that our commisery with it
                was so,
                that when we were stout and sound in it (those group and tradiotional ways), that I was fine,
                excellent in
                fact, and quite proper in our strides. But as life goes on, and our truer weakness and immatruity
                come to
                sway, we loose such prominence, and erode to the outer edges. "Where were simply looking in." It is
                from
                here that my life has been formed. For indeed, family trauma has bent me, nor had my actions been
                rich in
                sense or solidity; and as such, we were naturally unkept or settled as to be so prominent in those
                taughty
                ways.
                <br>&emsp;Worth noting though, is that in all that time, and particularly as we were forced to grow
                up,
                there was never an ambition or sought return to such center. In it's entirety, this statement is not
                true,
                as there were motions that reflected such strides. But the intent was generally ill-founded. And an
                further
                sentiments of the sort were more akin to dreams and relief. "Whereby we had in fact become
                ourselves, and
                happily; but upon life's struggles and our trouble in being so, so did we conjure a destiny which
                remarked
                our greater selves, but to a glorious and generousdegree."

                So to return to our story, we had broken off with some friends, eventually found new ones, and bad
                habits at
                that. And as highschool came to a close, were seeped in the boutinless pit of romance and purpose;
                and our
                poor habits had more fuel, as well were our parentsdispleased.
                <br>&emsp;We reconciled this though and found a point of entry. We went to school in the following
                winter
                semester, to much acclaim and excitmenet. Only, I recall surely, that upon the mid-term exams, we
                were left
                feeling a little hollow and empty. Perhaps our poor efforts were not so rewarding, and thus our
                engagmenet
                was as solid as our effort was. But simply, without the novel motive of continuing to do well, the
                lack of
                purpose otherwise left me somewhat directionless and unconcerned about our school. The problem
                though, was
                that we were enrolled, and quite destined to find some place in life via this path. But of that I
                saw not.
                <br>&emsp;It was as if I gave way to my reserved and reckless self, but upon entering a better
                realm, saw no
                end in it, nor held any lasting enjoyment due to the applied nature of it. I firmly recall loving
                the
                initial half of the semester, as the lectures and post-secondary vibe just felt fun and meaningfull.
                But the
                second succcess was on the line, my immaturity and empty sight held me indismay.
                <br>&emsp;In the year prior some habits had pitched me into a rugged hell. And during that time I
                had
                expeirenced a weird hypocondria, where I thought I was dying. "Really just a mixture of destiny and
                dreams,
                and that of lonely bareness: by which my heart faintly whimpered." In this later stretch of the
                semester
                though, I began to consider suicide. Not literally, in that I sought out a means to it. Rather, as I
                reckon
                all would compare, that there was merely a hope for death, 'or rather a cease of our current spot'.
                I
                rememeber going to sleep one night, wishing I wouldn't wake up. That was the nature of our intent.
                Not so
                much that we would, but that our care to live was gone, and if we were here no longer, how good
                that'dbe.
                <br>&emsp;Things did even out though, as final exams occured, followed by a visit to the states. Our
                sentiments going in, and upon return, are not so clear, but I can say, as regards my habit, that I
                had
                become a little romantic about ceasing it, claiming 'todays the day, I quit'. And I recall
                proclaiming that
                right before I went on the trip; whereby I applied an almighty practice of binging on the soon to be
                rot
                substance, 'as if I would fill up my register, and satiate myself enough so that I could persist
                withotu
                doing it, indefinitely'. This worked as well as you'd imainge. For upon re-entry, I spent more time
                acting
                as I cared not to. And as the summer approach, I was sitting at my friends, in the monring in his
                backyard,
                and simply stated I was done. The whole time prior I had been exposed to such habits via certain
                friends.
                And in this time, those relations had become more distant; and thus my current plea was one that
                held not
                but me to say it. And my friend beside me was equally enamered, and pointedequally.
                <br>&emsp;I wont speak for him, but for me, I had pulled myself out of the hollow hole that my
                highschool
                finale had set me in. There was nothing solid I'd reached, but remaining from our attempted efforts
                was an
                esteem towards myself. I would have to reflect to really understand the specifics; but I can say,
                that this
                initial sense that I had to prove myself was gone; nor was there this lack of what I enjoyed, or
                cared about
                in life, to make me feel like efforts of the prior sort were needed. "I no longer felt I was in a
                hole.
                Merely standing at the edge of a meadow." For whichever reason, I pointed my efforts for the sake of
                that,
                of what I can only describe as my interests and propiety. Simply doing what seemed good in itself,
                and had
                me 'being' better, rather than progressing towards some end.
                <br>&emsp;On that day I quit, me and my friend went into his home. Similar to the bravado I had when
                quiting
                prior, 'when I had the flair and confidence that one similary has on new years, when they so
                hopefully
                resolve to change', that so was I equally elated and bent towards actions of an esteemed sort.
                Simply, we
                went on our computer and searched, 'ten healthiest foods'. Up came an article, showing Kale to have
                1,000 vitamin K, mussels to have 10,000 B12, and a few more of the sort. Something struck us about
                this, and initated a
                sentiment that has remained
                prevalent ever since. Being so inspired, we grabbed a bunch of flax, bananas and kale, and
                smoothie'd it up. Upon
                drinking it, we felt a little off about the flavor: but so did the point in our life changed. For
                despite the taste
                being a little rustic (and in retrospect, lacking of berries), we felt there was this strenght and
                assurance which camce
                from the quality of the food. We stood by it, reverred the good in it, and felt, akin to exercise,
                or that even of the
                esteemed career one should disipline themselves towards, that this item of ours was of pure worth,
                no matter the taste.
                "I might summarize this that we became ideal and disposed into taking our vitamins. And in that,
                became quite literate
                in the ways such things were espoused to benefit us. That they did is it's own matter. But of our
                efforts, we could at
                least prosper from our belief in them, and all the harmony which surroundedthat."

                To properly view the world, you have to recognize that it is on a global scale. And thus conflict
                and or
                depravity will be exhibited within that total realm. The very fact that we have an economy, means
                that the
                pace of our life will move towards and draw from markets. And by that, as all conflict is based on
                preservation, so will the shortcomings of that propell some to take what others have.
                <br>&emsp;By this, I cannot say I know what is right and wrong. For I don't submitt to much more
                than these
                mere happenings. And of those purer causes, so is it but a drip of time to mend things out. And
                indeed, all
                negative conception can be blunted by this sense. For even in moments of severity, ought this be
                shouldered
                by calmer moments leading in, and simpler moments following. "And we ought not accept the fallacy of
                thinking that this natural process of things is but a surrounding to an otherwise eradict event;
                rather, it
                too proceeds with common cause."
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, our core philosophy is that nothing occurs but through the annals of time.
                And
                generally all that occurs well, comes from inventions of sort; by which all can transition to use
                such
                advents, and propell the status of things to newer highs. But conflict and misfortune take time to
                accrue,
                and at that, are as equally swift in their progress.
                <br>&emsp;From this, we are left with the odd remark, in that, if we are free enough to see the
                annals
                ahead, then ought we sink into such liberty and provide the products born from that. Or ought we
                scower the
                land around, and see whether or not there are those worse off than us. "Those who are sat un less
                even
                grounds us; as remarks perhaps the time, the culture, lineage even. For we may be so well off
                because of our
                particular circumstance; rather than that which is provided to all by the general times and ways:
                some may
                not have so readily caughtup."
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, are furried threat is that of suggestion, and our vulernability from not being so
                progressively applied. Indeed, I don't feel that those who provoke such feelings do so with the aim
                of me
                being a rebel. In fact, I think they'd like me to see the way things are, as to contribute towards a
                lasting
                change. Regardless of the strenght in what they say, and whether it illuminates issues as I'd see,
                so are we
                comparable in aim, to wit, we both care for the propserity of people; and by that token, the
                development
                pasttradition.
                <br>&emsp;Our problem perhaps is that we don't live in a pasturized state, as to worry only about
                what is
                fair and relevant. Even if there were a war, and bombs were dropped, so wouldn't I know outside of a
                superficual degree. This indeed is a dear admission. For much of my contention with those who prompt
                such
                thinness, do so only to the effect of our fear of something happening at all. And all too much of
                our sense
                bears the weight of reproaching from the belief that something will happen at all. "It would be
                better to
                accept that it can, but that, of reality, ought the bones of that be as strong as our conceptions
                would
                benefit." Indeed, this is quite tough, for reason says that little of which is true is actually
                known. And
                so in our less than applied ways, we are no less ignorant or short of principle. Nevertheless, upon
                hearing
                words of reason, or the babblings of this and other, so is our 'senility' within our particular
                freedom
                tampered with. And we are left with this underlying fear that things are not as we'd mind. "Perhaps
                the
                world is not so large, and our mature view is not representative."
                <br>&emsp;Hereby our friction stands, to the effect, that of our balance between inputs which
                unsettle, so
                lies the counter of a sturdy understanding; wherein we are not simply with reproach, and humbly at
                ease
                outside of being provoked, but rather clear on things, and with a grip on them as our deeper
                sentiments
                reflect. To the effect that the complexion of our reproach is not merely a lauded haze, but a solid
                iron of
                which the obscurity of the world is known. "And not even the clearest debree of tradition or
                pundancy could
                penetratethat."
                <br>&emsp;Where I stand then is in a sort of memory. As if, in a ruffled stated, we recalled how the
                burning
                grief present in our mind was in fact not laudible, nor comparable to our past experience of a deep
                and
                tranquil mind. By that, I'd state that the mind is but an electrical response, with a mere obscurity
                to
                distribution. By that, lies the contention of being: but to us, nothing special lies. At any rate,
                even if
                we lived in a war torn country, the service required of us would be one of sacrifice; to which our
                triumph
                was in courage, rather than overcoming defeat. "Herein lies the hunting grounds for chimera's of
                pain of
                monstrosity."
                <br>&emsp;No matter, the fact remains that the world is relativley modern. And that, of those which
                we deem
                other, so are they so but in a novel way, rather than of the distinct sort in which our past
                relations
                reflected. We are all human; and despite the holes in our conduct, so is their a common union of
                aims and
                values; by which, in whole or parts, we share, support, and at the very least accept, the shared
                goal of
                love and prosperity. From this, I give much aceeptence to the fact that less a medely of nuclear
                bombs are
                dropped, that the world will persist. The effects of the climate, however progressed or developed,
                will be
                but novelly poor. "As our times are such, that the very matter of annihilation is a mark of us being
                civilized enough as not to seek that, that so would our lasting process into a warming world, see a
                resourcefull attempt to mitigate that: and at the very least treat its effects. To which we say, the
                result
                is but a degree of prominent perril." Robots sit 100 miles off of any reasonable regard; and surely,
                find
                themselves being seen with a even mind and confident eye.

                So this may be a fools errand, as I have an interest in forming our selves, as not to be so
                impressionable
                during our rest or idle periods. I recognize though that during those moments, I will still be
                subject to
                said impressions. But my thought, is that by strengthening our views of things, as not to be so hazy
                or
                orbiting around, that their clearness and nearness will bear me a natural posture; and thus a normal
                insolubility to sorbibsights.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, we are trying to learn of the world. Depth is one thing, but breadth is what I
                seek.
                Some things have a natural pairing with histroy, in population namely; or that of illness and death.
                But the
                reality is, that our efforts are pointed towards denominations and their resepctive proportions
                within a
                part of life. The rate of malaria in Africa, the suicide rate in Asia, the prevalance of aids in
                Europe, or
                the homicide rate in South America.
                <br>&emsp;That being said, it is important to note the weight we put on certain strata. For the
                earth as a
                whole is in reality a set of continents, and they nations. These however, are each split into
                regions,
                states, terriotries/holds, cities and districts --Eastside of NewYork compared to the Bronx. For our
                efforts, it makes sense to have a solid view of the larger pieces, and then specialzie in certain
                smaller
                parts. We may learn about the whole of Nigeria, the whole of China's southern region, the whole of
                Ontario,
                the whole of Miami, the whole of Compton. We will never know the whole of all these pieces. There is
                just
                too much. But we can find strenght at lower depth, comparable to what we have near the surface.
                <br>&emsp;At that, I'd describe our broader efforts as one which balance between continents and
                countries.
                For the matters of Asia are one thing, but those of India and China seem most prevalent. In that
                sense,
                Canada, the US and Mexico are a fair western batch, as is Brazil, Argentina and Urugay perhaps;
                along with
                Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa another; and Britain, Germany and France as the big European three.

                So it feels like we should be ourselves; but in that, be somewhat seperate, if not distinct, from
                our mother
                and father.
                <br>&emsp;It would seem preferable that we'd all co-exist. But if there isn't a shared view of
                things, or
                taste for what not, then the seriousness of this may lead to distance yourself. For I will always be
                near,
                if not around. But our actual invovlement, if beyond family matters, is spent together, is up
                forquestion.
                <br>&emsp;For my parents view the news. And idneed, without our own sect of ingestion, we are left a
                little
                thwarted by the very prescence of this; as if said source is something soul and entire, 'as in the
                governances of fables: to which the protaganist ignores'.
                <br>&emsp;In the comparison of church, there are many, and of varied divisions and orders; kinds
                even. By
                seeing that our parents view one line of things, so are we less grieved by the impression of such
                thing,
                'for it is merely one of many means of impression'.
                <br>&emsp;What I find though, is that I feel a little bare when we are so disposed to our view of
                things; if
                we are humouring this varied mix. But if I simply be, and not worry so much about our identity, then
                the
                prescence of the news becomes consuming. For it is not so that it is special in its impressions;
                rather,
                that by our cirucmstance, we are privy to it: for our parents watch it often through the day.
                <br>&emsp;I will state for the record, that our animosity is akin to a disturbance of peace. A state
                of
                which may not rightly be so; but no so for we lack which the disturbanced is in the form of; but
                rather our
                somewhat private and or unoccupied means of peace. In that, our identity is such as to receive less
                impression, as we are sold to another. But in this, we are less receptive to our family and fortune:
                for
                like impressions, we keep things out. And so I feel more confident, and longing, for a scenario
                which is
                faciliative to that: likely by our own means, rather than the generoisity of ourparents.
                <br>&emsp;It may simply be so, that our parents are inclined to watch the news. They may have very
                well been
                more mdoern, and watched podcasts, or been more delierate, and watched nothing at all. "At least,
                whatever
                they did watch, they were aware of it, and noted assuch."
                <br>&emsp;The trouble is that I cannot say anything. For it is essentially peverting our state in
                the
                family; nor, if we then moved out, or provided for ourself, would we so deeply care: or be privy to
                such
                disturbances.
                <br>&emsp;The reality though, is we are not asked to contend with what they see or feel regarding
                the news.
                Nor do we have to humour their fascination, or respect for those invovled. Words of the kind have
                never
                comeup.
                <br>&emsp;Where were left then, is in this comparable spot to one we've been in before; whereby we
                sit, a
                little uneased, but in a space which ought be alotgether full of it: for we are given all, and asked
                for
                not: yet still remain unfine, or at least susceptible to intrusion. Our little world is what's
                provided. But
                this get's tampered with from media and tv.
                <br>&emsp;I guess my resovle ought be, as reflects our encouragment to learn what we are otherwise
                in
                defense of, as contrasts those impressions which we deny, what it is we ought to do, or can do and
                would
                like, with respect to what we know. Which is in all, to say, that perhaps ideally their would be a
                different
                form to our gradual approach, in that the strenghts and weaknesses of it would be natural. But in
                this case,
                even if the weaknesses exposed are akin to that which gets shown upon vile consumption, that so may
                we
                attest to the thing discovered. And considering the principle defect shown, or insight gained, so
                may our
                resolve be equally based. "In that, upon learning who we truly are, may we amend to something truly
                worth
                doing: and how we deliberaytleybe."

                So I am not a solider, nor will I be one. I accept the conflict that others may find with those
                around them;
                but I am all too happy to accept any ones rule. Much aggression has occured due to self-defense. But
                personally, there is nothing I hold dear which can be taken from me: as all good is already mine.
                Indeed,
                one may coherce me to do something. But nothing which goes against what I already do. "I am not
                defending a
                belief agasint another, as I have nonealready."
                <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the unclaimed land of inquiry. Around this lies the smoldering
                flame of
                legend: namely, that of other peoples view ofthings.
                <br>&emsp;For there may be a war, and it may appear as if all are fixated on this. But there is, in
                reality,
                a grand assortment of people whos minds are somewhere else. Nor, is any event, so special when
                compared to
                the millions around. The world will simply moveon.
                <br>&emsp;I cannot always see this though. Indeed, my aversion to particular sources is that they
                flatten my
                view of things, and make bank of knowledge squishy. But the truth, is that without the sensibility
                which
                remarks what I have known, then so will I become engrained to the fixated sense: where I then fear
                and
                believe, that of a conflict there is exclusively so; and of others views, so are they but nearer to
                the soul
                thing of importance.
                <br>&emsp;My life then is odd. For the base of it comes down to our ignorance of tradition, and an
                otherwise
                state within a path uncompramised. From here, we've simply asked questions. Perhaps out of this
                dynamic,
                whereby we are left with nothing but which we have. And our family is perhaps so acceptably present,
                that
                there habits and views become enclosed around me, 'as that smoldering flame'. I never seem to escape
                this.
                In fact, those early days of self-embrace, and the cause of that, come from a similar process, in
                that our
                parents were not listened to: and so we found our other way. For having none felt hopeless and not.
                <br>&emsp;Where I have come to grow, is in the constance of this state, even if I was smoldered; and
                from
                there, drawn to restless rebuke, or rot relief. But I carried on; in some ways addressing the
                principle
                nature of this way, whereby I curried myself as not to be so vulnerable. But I never found anything
                else, in
                realtionships, meaning or friends. And so, the lingering heart of our mom and dad was so, that our
                shortcomings were immediately subject to their prescence. "One of which is moulded in sharp contrast
                to
                mine." Indeed, this state of constance has shown me, that of it polished shine, that this need not
                be
                sequestered, or imperfect. We may simply choose as to reflect the cheer in that way; and perhaps be
                invested
                and ordained enough, as not to notice the heat from those, who'd melt you when you've lost your
                ownflame

                So we have potential interviews coming up in a few weeks. If not, we have a more than likely
                approach to a
                march 1st move.
                <br>&emsp;For now, our health is in turmoil, as our lack of pushups and pullups has had me in a soft
                state;
                but our efforts to improve this have been toforceufull.
                <br>&emsp;I am more or less resolving to principle. Primarily, we are going to convert our attention
                to
                running, and use free range as a intermidary motion, and those pushups and accompanying exercises to
                broaden
                said running. Too much are we doing the latter without any foundatioanl respect: to which we become
                gritteddown.
                <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are morning, stabilitiy and rest. For that, there are practices and
                commonstrides.
                <br>&emsp;For one, we simply stand, fold, raise our arms over head, and potentially squat too. For
                stability, we mix runners lunge and lifts; with slight variations of warrior, leg raise and or
                bridge, quad
                stretch, and more emphasis on upward dog and planks. Attached to this are actual stretches; for I
                know too
                few besides pigeon pose; and so adding that to our stability seems fair. Rest centers around your
                shoulders
                and hips. Though, besides brief stetches, our shoulders having nothing more than the suttle recovery
                of our
                spine: for which they sit more gently. We may hug, cross, or bend, but this feels more dynamic than
                a merry
                hip opener or twist. Still, it is crossing our legs or arms which remark rest, then rinsing it off
                with
                baser poses --prone or supine.

                I can't speak to my life. And, fairly, I sit a little humble and unperturbed. This moment isn't a
                great one;
                but it is fine being so. For the days ahead are so stout and true, that in principle, theres not

                tosay.
                <br>&emsp;We are so free to be hired, that I cannot even care. We will work some amount, but the
                reason for
                it is good, as is there a moderate amount of joy, and otherwise benefit from doingso.
                <br>&emsp;As a spring, we are thus stable. And via our developed approach, may we see the future,
                and
                gradually reach it. Or, if we are more content and propped to be, or see things differently, then so
                may we
                reflect, and via letters, share. "Our view of children is mine. And is much more intended for you?

                So I have some feelings that are causing me grief. There's no problem, but my view of certain things
                feel
                unknown, and so I thought by merely sharing this, my aprpehension wouldcease.
                <br>&emsp;So I am writing this, not becuase there's some problem to be solved or thing to be changed
                Rather,
                I just have some feelings, and hiding them is causing me to feel contentious, but not warrentedly.
                So I
                thought that sharing them would remedythis.
                <br>&emsp;First, I do not like the news. It does not speak to me, nor does it reflect how I see the
                world,
                and by that, how I desire and fear things. I simply don't identify with it. It is not a resource
                which I
                admire, or find pleasure engaging with. I've felt this way for a long time, and it is the key
                example of a
                feeling which makes something into a problem, only because it is unheard. Nothing need change. I
                just wanted
                you toknow.
                <br>&emsp;///Ever since I moved up to Kamloops, and to this day, I have felt off because of this, as
                every
                morning and night, the news is on one of our tvs. To me, my ignorance is not measuredd by whether I
                watch
                the news or not. The world is larger and more mundane than anything it provokes. Which is indeed my
                biggest
                grievence with it, that it provokes me, to feel sympathy and frustration. I find no pleasure in
                this, and in
                my personal time, I avoid such things --in terms of my time and youtube etc.//// I am not asking
                anything to
                change. But as I said, not sharing my feeling leads to unfair judgement and resentment, and I'd
                rather it be
                known how I feel, then be full of irritation and scorn. I simply don't care forit.
                <br>&emsp;Secondly, is the course of my life. To squash this pretense that 'my oddities are an
                inhibitor to
                things', I would say, conversely, that my lack of friends, career and romance are not so because
                I've made
                myself uneligble. It's simply because of the choices I made. Prior to leaving Vancouver, I was well
                sat at
                work, in friends and potential romance. I don't expect that this cannot return. In term's of work, I
                see the
                promise (as mom suggested) in getting a certifacte in IT. I cannot say this is my prferred job
                though, as it
                would surely be from home, and right now, I care more to be around people, and work on my feet. It
                is a good
                option, and there are much more like it, but it is not in my current sights. It is something I can
                progress
                towards, and develop my baser means of income, but when I think of what I'd really like to do, for
                interests
                sake, I'd like to make a TikTok channel, making little quotes and phrases made from my writing. It
                has to be
                a buisness though, as the consistency required cannot be approached casually, nor
                withoutpreperation.
                <br>&emsp;Neither of these mean that the other can't be pursued, but they'll each find theirtime.
                <br>&emsp;I feel drawn to do this, but I'm being realistic about how much it takes, and what I'm
                willing to
                do right now. I don't see this interfering with more standard work, but one is but a development
                past
                working basic labor, while the other is about something I'd truly care for. Each will find
                theirtime.
                <br>&emsp;Thirdly, is chidlren. Say what you will of my life, where it's lacking, where it could be,
                but I
                contend, that the only thing I have to anwser to, in terms of some requirment in life ahead, is
                children. I
                can say, that naturally, I'll have one. I say this happily, and with understanding of what it needs.
                Having
                given this some thought prior, I can say that I'd only want 1. That, and I see myself doing so when
                I am
                ready to make it my primary happiness and responsability. Currently, theres an abudnacne of things I
                otherwise care for, and am driven towards. So beyond my means to having a kid, I don't have much
                desire for
                one, now at least. And as for a relationship which would precede this, I have no fear or worry about
                that.
                My oddities, upon thought, are not any concenr, or something I can't adjust.
                <br>&emsp;All in all, my only cares are to write, read and study, play games, watch youtube, be
                healthy and
                relish the outdoors. This is satisfactory on my own; and I can surely invovle more people in this.
                Even if
                there are none who I connect with on said basis, there are still other things I can do to be more
                social, or
                balance out my life elsewhere. These cares of mine feed off my ability to engage with them, which is
                the
                reason I care about being healthy: as the more I am, the more I can thrown myself in. And the moral
                of my
                life has been, that these things need not be sacrificed in order to pursue/have other things. You
                merely add
                tothem.
                <br>&emsp;Those are my feelings, such is my way. If I can live accordinfly, than I am happy to be
                home, and
                benefit byit.
                <br>&emsp;--to even out the rest of my life.
                <br>&emsp;These are my dearest cares. When I am unhealthy and flattened by junk, they feel far away.
                I ought
                not be so frugal for the sake of these, at the expense of friends and all other things. But
                considering that
                those can be fit into my life, so am I unapolegtic for being as good as my happiness from those
                other things
                can beenfit from.

                    <div class="text-body">So I question whether our view of things is as solid as we believe. For one, we are
                        not
                        in the scenarios which appear to us on tv. Nor does it truly represent what it is like to be there.
                        Indeed,
                        we can imagine what it is like, but therein lies the issue. Whereas reading impresses you calmy and
                        fully, I
                        find that visual inputs are saturating, and blend little with what I already know, with any conserved
                        proportions. And indeed, my deepest aversion to such mediums is how they distort my sizeable view of the
                        world, and instead mix it all up, to where it feels chaotic and small. "As if those suffering were right
                        over there; or threats upon me, were right at my door." This runs against the scope of the world. And
                        indeed, despite the loose depiction which we get; or at the very least a simplified view, as if we take
                        for
                        granted that everything visual encapsulates all the many happenings around, so are we left far abroad,
                        likely fortunate, be it of the country were in, or our particlar home. And from there, it seems that we
                        are
                        not but interested, in awe, and perhaps gripped by the narrative of it all: in how bad some have it, and
                        how
                        bad some produce. This is but a glancing contribution though; and I would say, that it is not those so
                        keen
                        to watch from abroad which hold the key to aid, but those in the communities near the incident. This is
                        a
                        deep mark against visual formatts, for they glimmer so brightly at us, that we sometimes forget that
                        what
                        their showing us is a world away; and that many governments and peoples lie between us and that. Is our
                        passive interest during the 6:00 news really helping? I would say, that there are ways to help. But
                        these
                        seem almost eclusivley relevant to direct action, rather than our mere emotional invovlement. Of that I
                        am
                        unsure, for none of it seems to center around anything other than education. There may be other avenues,
                        but
                        they seem centered on spreading senitment; which, albeit suspect for shallow grounds, still appeals to
                        the
                        heart of the matter, and in an outstanding way. There is surely room for both. If your not doing that
                        though, then I don't feel like your earning anything more than a coloring of your worldview, and by
                        that, a
                        tipped balance of your own life and propserity. By all accounts, a view of the world which holds history
                        and
                        breadth in regard, is not likely drawn to matters of those entire continents away. Our actions are quite
                        unoticible to those a province over; or a town even. I scorn not at those who shout with sentiment, or
                        try
                        and educate those about the matter. But those recieving ought do so with propiety, 'as not to be moulded
                        by
                        headlines and glamour'. Were looking for education, not wonder.
                        <br>&emsp;I guess my point, is that if your not going to produce anything meaningfull, then why feed off
                        of
                        those who do so, but in a way that is unfitting for a truly deep and enrichened view? Learning is of
                        interest beyond conquest; but of that, your liberty lies. And why, in all your freedom, to be merely
                        keen,
                        would you settle? Personally, I see the visual format as more accessible, and the programming nature to
                        be
                        excitable. "I am so frustrated though, because I angle my interests differently, towards an end which
                        actually treats my care to know things, not what is merely appealing. Such things, as I've found, are
                        akin
                        to fast-food, in that they are filling, but not in a wholesome or abundant way."

                        So mom and dad, and surely Jess, are not out to get you. They demand very little of you. But they
                        indeed, do
                        not hunour, or at least aid, our natural happiness; nor the form it takes.
                        <br>&emsp;We are unsure of things, necessarily, but via circumstance too. We do not know about work,
                        about
                        living here, what our harmony with that means for the future. And life's mystery avails us here too.
                        Generally, this centers on the chimeras of violence and revolt, but also our positive decree, of
                        uniformity
                        and fecundity. We know not where this road goes, nor if the bumps were filling are from the ground or
                        uneven
                        shoes.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel like a stranger in my own home. No one has the faintest idea of what cheer and
                        flourishing
                        great activity brings; and how nutered this is from poor choices; or a lack of good ones. Their surprise
                        and
                        sketicism is not appreciated. As if anything they did was understood on some basic level, besides a
                        norm;
                        yet, I am only ever asked the most unfamiliar question, 'as if eating Broccoli or working out was a good
                        thing....like how?'.
                        <br>&emsp;Those shoes of ours show themselves, almost clearly when under pressure, how unset they are,
                        and
                        the road, whihc, from our sight and prior view, is not so bumpy in character. Yet, it is rough, and
                        demanding of attention; and apt to bring wear and control: as all pursuits and itineraries do. Our
                        uncertainty of which part of the path we'll take,and the evdient preview of this, to which our feet have
                        not
                        hit earth and steadied forth, explains our current wear.

                        The matter of positive and negative regard defines our life. For whichever reason, we are left somewhat
                        elated, at the postive prospect of being at home, freely employed and rightly so, and thereby with our
                        family, propped for the sun and her darling scene; nor the lackings of food, equipment and fun. We can
                        live
                        here, just as we may live elsewhere.
                        <br>&emsp;The negativity though comes from some sort of reason; as if something is pressuring you, an
                        ailment as it were. And indeed, much of our strife comes from the frustration that others dimiss said
                        issues. Though, it is perhaps we who are ill-sighted, and have far too long been in such a decrepid
                        state.
                        Indeed, life fits is with such trauma, and naturally, so are we but responding to the ticks and tacks
                        gotten
                        along the way. This is for us to enlighten our soul though: for upon near reflection, we are not in fact

                        drug, but rather set to be, merrily, proper, and good as so.

                        So, prior to leaving Kamloops, we were in a solid routine, generally. We were exercising, not eating
                        sugar,
                        our sleep was well. Comapred to now, we were not running, nor doing much recovery. Our workouots were
                        not
                        too consistent, though we were fairly constant in our free range.
                        <br>&emsp;As we've moved though, and aided Jessica in here move, we've lost a great deal of momentum. To
                        the
                        point, where our workouts are either absent, or done forecfully, to a fairly negative degree. The perril
                        is
                        in our hips, in that we sit too narrow while trying to be upright, and this causes a lordosis in our mid
                        back; to which our shoulders come together, but in a shrug. This is killing our neck. Normally it does
                        not,
                        but we have no fair means to do pushups, or squats even; and so we beckon at the effect of not working
                        out,
                        or push through that poor posture.
                        <br>&emsp;In principle, we should do what is right for now. Despite recognizing our lack, we still are
                        best
                        to do things well. I think, foremost, we could diversify our stable motions. This does not mean we'd
                        practice, but akin to a forward fold, simply do more movements in a common way. Low lunge side twist
                        plus
                        quad stretch has been a great advent of this. There is room to do more volume when it comes to lifts,
                        and
                        perhaps warrior, but when it comes to leg raise, bridge, squating, ought we do it as if it were some
                        indispenisible stretch. Include it with a forward fold, or arm raise, and you'll be more open through
                        the
                        day. For now, we ought return to our strenght, and let the running we've done sink in, all while the
                        retain
                        our mould through stability, and our common poses.
                        <br>&emsp;Food wise were best to eat a fair amount. It is required that you wake up early. No more
                        waking up
                        past 9. If your alarm isn't working, get a new one. It derails us to wake up so late. Our veggies,
                        orange,
                        dried fruit and milk are perfect for the first half of our day. Indeed, I am not so clear or directed as
                        to
                        what our evening should be, or where and how it should be transitioned too. It is indeed a result of our
                        ineptitude as regards money. For we might be best to get corn, edamame, tuna, and otherwise lean on
                        quinoa,
                        as opposed to potatoes, rice and bread. These are not always welcomed. I would not forget, that much of
                        your
                        weightloss comes from not eating enough, rather than eating fully, but to ineffective degree.
                        <br>&emsp;We need seeds, oranges, soft bread, quinoa and milk, along with dried fruit.

                        The reality of my life is that little is required. Even this anxious pretense of children is not ripe
                        for
                        trouble, as frugal living levels out all needs.
                        <br>&emsp;My querry though is along the lines of positivity, and what this is afforded by. For I do see
                        that
                        stability is needed, so that we may live and rest securely. But in that, is there any quality which one
                        place is damned to lack? I do see varied complexions and nodes of interaction, but all in all, each
                        place is
                        the same. We work, live, rest, and around that, invest, learn, connect and grow. If we can do this well
                        in
                        one home, we can in another. And even if certain grooves are found only in certain spots, so does this
                        not
                        change the steadyness of our hand: or the rocky bounds that each spot holds.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I am remissed to say that more work may be required, if only because any on offer
                        demands
                        at least that much. This is a nice predicament; as we may verily be in a compramised spot, where ease is
                        found through shortcuts. In any case, I do expect that our demands will lighten, in volume surely. In
                        quality, so may the times not prevail. But so is there promise around.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in coming up with reaons to be, as if we would be free. For I do not
                        imagine
                        that our baser conditions will detach. Though, I can't say there's any grievence about this, as little
                        of
                        what I'd consider natrually required is either contrary or run down by our demands. It is moreso about
                        the
                        ration of work and living: and seeing that of what I might expect, that theres more of the former than
                        I'd
                        prefer, or desire.
                        <br>&emsp;It just seems like the color of the morn, the grazing of literature and the world, or the mere
                        cheer of gaming and fun, is enough for me to at least be ordinarly, but in a flourishing manner. Of our
                        broader purpose and place, I cannot say. But these things are not at heart to do with horiztonal growth,
                        towards presumed goods abound. We are still left with the balance of work and living. Our intent though,
                        or
                        meaning, may not come about but through our pleasant pace and peace, to which I am happy to find.
                        <br>&emsp;It's just not very clear what to do. For the past and her wares has me somewhat beholden,'like
                        mud
                        on my shirt', to the sentiments and or edges of our time. This is holding less interest in me, nor much
                        reason upon reflection. For instance, the difference of location is not so special, for all places are
                        almost equally esteemed in the good they offer. "Ten pounds of chocolate or vanilla still makes for a
                        heap
                        of ice-cream." Furthermore, the time of year is holding less of that bookended chain. For the winters
                        hold a
                        bare complexion, but vibrance too. Nor is the fresh air something to be averse to. Moreover, there is
                        not
                        much thought in me that says, 'we only mean to be somewhere for a short while, so we must go where we
                        wish
                        within a certain time, otherwise we'll miss the sweetspot of it'. This simply isn't so. There's no need
                        to
                        be anywhere but where you are: where time has brought you, and for all things good, you have formed
                        yourself
                        to be. Change may occur, but frett not. Our time allows for all, nor ought we remark much but the good
                        we
                        see: rather than the wish for more. And at any rate, the reality of all future concern, is to do with
                        things
                        of a broader sort. And indeed, I may only see a hill of riches infront; and by our admittedly uneven
                        grounds, may not see much further. But life will have moved on and caught up upon reaching said point:
                        to
                        where our measure of good is more, and beyond. And as we said, in terms of things far and about, so will
                        this come into clarity and interest by our flourishing way. "And that is about the best one could hope
                        for."

                        us.
                        Indeed, this proposition is perhaps flawed, as the requisite that we eat and sleep assigns us a
                        neccessary
                        mean to achieve such. So we'd properly say, that given food and a place to rest, so would we not have to
                        work. We may lack the common means for fun, but so may we gaze at the world and delight.
                        <br>&emsp;The point being that, for the fact that such things are provided, and the good which we'd
                        recieve
                        if they were, means that something is given up for the sake of said provision. And indeed this seems the
                        fashion the course for employment; in that, the work required is not so much a negative, but rather an
                        intrusion to positivity. "For indeed, the actual return of such work comes into qeustion: for if I got
                        twice
                        as much, I would at least have more good to purchase. While those who earn little, have little but their
                        needs met, and not much more: making the obligation a chore, rather than a happy mean."
                        <br>&emsp;Conversenly, to state the terms, being given such provision removes your ability to see ahead,
                        or
                        be so free in your strides. For dependance holds no sure end, even if it were a dreaded one. Nor, in the
                        case of family, where judgement is given, is rest easy to achieve: for you are not saxrifcing anything,
                        and
                        thus deserving of a break. But as such, as the worth of dependance is in the abscence of work, that so
                        are
                        you not happy without using your free time for such. Indeed, this is not hard to do, despite the
                        insecurity
                        of how long you may do so. But sustaining this is hard when rest is hard to sink into: as your free time
                        is
                        not esteemed as work, despite the effort invovled. Balance is thus hard to achieve, consistently
                        -without
                        ware.
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, I see that our life is full of positivity, and the minor amount of worked
                        required to
                        be stable, will not cause much interference. In fact, despite the volume of our time being spent on said
                        work, there is the benefit from the actual work, in that it is not as concentrated as your creative
                        efforts.
                        Plus, it is usually around other people. Beyond the balance of exchange, there still lies the preferred
                        lock
                        on your contuinuity. For it is better to earn a bit less, but increase your stock, then to have alot,
                        but
                        whither it away. "For the end is one of loss." As it were, the benefit here is one that magnifies all
                        other
                        goods; and over time, leverages itself into fuller forms, as to increase the magnitude of our living.

                        So I'm thinking that if were going to stay here, that we work at Superstore. It is close, and this melds
                        with an unbridled view of being here. There's no room for pretense. We may consider our future, as
                        regards
                        buisness, contribution or rearing. But so is this in need of clarity, and as such, living well produces
                        thus. So we need not be anywhere particular for said times to come in line. Besides that, we are merely
                        swell and pure: and this need not bank on any one localle: and can grow and adapt as well in all spots,
                        present or to come.
                        <br>&emsp;In that way, I see a similar prospect in East or West walmart. I feel there is more room to
                        negotiate, and so surely, we can achieve that marbled 2 day per week routine. Perhaps, an arrangment of
                        shorter shifts.
                        <br>&emsp;Let's say though that none of the three are hiring. We may choose to leave, be asked to, or
                        stay
                        for the nearer prospects ahead, or something freerer and indefinite.
                        <br>&emsp;What I would proclaim, is that living unstabiliy holds a blurred view of the future; as you
                        cannot
                        remark upon it with clear desire or ability. As such, you settle into the gradual paces of your day, or
                        idealize some broader end --as to carry you out. The struggle in this, is that living so gradually
                        wobbles
                        at the intolerance of doing so; and so rest becomes a parched resource: as you may live fully and truly,
                        as
                        you are both composed and definite in your striding state: but so upon the need for rest, do you crumble
                        and
                        despair: yielding an all to common ware.
                        <br>&emsp;Compared to this, the benefit of work, or stability rather, is that you are secure in your
                        means
                        and your further direction. This brings with it the balance of labor and liberty: but so does such
                        things
                        have their own principle measures. At any rate, the advantage of being so set, is not itself a divine
                        privalage, or one of scorching neccessity. It is perhaps right, but not exlusivley. Our gradual ways,
                        which
                        is to say those which are less ideal or worn, but more ripe and solid instead, do produce such future
                        remarks. Indeed, they are not hoistered by the sentiments which stability brings, and therefore lack as
                        much
                        focus or actionable regard: but they do linger between the bounds of this, and by that, hold much
                        concerns
                        for farther ideals, and those comparable but of a nearer sort.

                        So rice, barley, lentils and potatoes are a given.
                        <br>&emsp;Oranges are around 3-4$ for 6, so likely less than 5 for 7. Similar to tofu or other one off
                        things, you may buy several more for a days worth, but this does not define the price.
                        <br>&emsp;Kale is 2$ and lasts some time. It's so good, and its more likely, besides soups, that if you
                        boughht 3, you'd have plenty for 2 weeks.
                        <br>&emsp;Bread is an oddity, as you generally have soft bread, which runs about 5 servings for 4$, or
                        english muffins, which have 3 servings for 2$.
                        <br>&emsp;Dried fruit is relatively inexpensive, but must be refilled often for the benefit to stay.
                        Dates
                        come and go, and their price is more limited by the breadth of selection. Whle cranberries are quite
                        clear,
                        in that the low sugar ones are 2.5$ on sale (often). I tend to afford 2 packs a week, though it is
                        likely
                        that you'd have 1 or 2 less for the month.
                        <br>&emsp;Popcorn is not an incidental expense like a potato, as you must pay about 5$ for a pack of 12.
                        You
                        may buy smaller, and accomodate a less than constant use. But the value is there. Though, Orville is
                        more
                        expensive.
                        <br>&emsp;Milk is the grand puba of economic understanding. For you drink it to get calcium and B12. You
                        may
                        supplement elsewhere, but generally, such vitamins are about 10-15$ for a 3 month supply. Calcium is had
                        amply through milk, and B12 is techincally only half way served. Vitamin D is almost not served, as is
                        Iodine a technical abscence. At any rate, a 2l jug of oat or soy milk runs 4$. It may be 5, but it is
                        often
                        closer to 4. And indeed there are sales, and bulk prospects. Because calcium and the filling for the
                        midday
                        is the milks purpose, you tend to get 8-10 servings per jug. I'd still average 4 per month. And if some
                        expense could be procurred, I'd say, while avoiding sugar, that having more than one serving per day
                        would
                        be nutritionally, practically, and satiably beneficial.
                        <br>&emsp;Similar to this is edamame, which tends not to be too expensive, coming in at about 2$ for two
                        servings, or about 3-4$ for a several serving bag. These are had off and on, so buying a single pack for
                        2
                        servings may suffice.
                        <br>&emsp;Quinoa is similar to milk, in that upon any excess beyond the essentials, so is this first to
                        be
                        incorporated. As it's protein content in tangent with it's nature as a grain, makes it a rich
                        supplemeent
                        and or compliment to your baser grains. You may buy 1kg for 6$, which does last a week. Or you may buy a
                        larger bulk bag for a comparable price ratio. "The price of pure bulk is not known."
                        <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are the buzzing's of snacks and junk, all tending to be a couple to 5 dollars
                        for
                        a serving or two. Chips for instance, run about 4$ for two servings, as do veggie dumplings run a
                        similar
                        price. Samosas compare though may be more expensive depending on the kind.
                        <br>&emsp;As a techincal aside, bread is split into soft and muffins. The former ranges from 3-5, the
                        latter
                        a pure 2. Seems laudible at 5$ per week.
                        <br>&emsp;The big one, is grains. Rice is 3$ for 2kg, which is a large amount. Barley is 2$ per lb,
                        though
                        this can be lowered with bulk ---and you do not eat as much in terms of volume. Lentils are quite cheap,
                        coming in at 1kg for 3$, and the value in that is unmatched. It seems laudible that rice is a one off,
                        lentisl come every 2 weeks, and barley is a main, with 2 bags likely sufficing per week.

                        // January 27th
                        <br>&emsp;I'm definitely at dis-ease. Speaking to Dev is a sort of authorative submission, as I have
                        this
                        idea that he's unpleased to see me. This is not entirely true. Indeed, if I fell into this fear, and
                        spoke
                        to him inappropriately, then that would be something I brought on my self. But it has been time, and we
                        are
                        not at all being excessive. We simply phone and check in. He may say yes or he may say no. And truly,
                        there
                        is much room for both. Walmarts are there, but ideally, we'd work at Superstore, two days a week. The
                        schedule may be off, but surely we can bring it up once employed. I am fretting though whether or not to
                        bring this up; as I fear that saying we want few hours makes me unappealling. Walmart feels more
                        approachable in this manner. The stakes in all of this are small, as I have no choice to leave, and by
                        that,
                        am at least properly headed.

                        It is worth reflecting on the single shift routine. As such a spot on your otherwise empty calender, can
                        produce more of a friction, as it seems so startingly different from your free time.
                        <br>&emsp;Unlike this is the two shift state, as even a back to back creates a meaningfull invovlment:
                        as if
                        it were a stronger fulcrum. Or, with some favor, each may be spread out, and you work one here, another
                        there, with breaks in between. This is the best actually; and supercedes the single shift, whose rate is
                        simply to low compared to the smaller breaks between two shifts.
                        <br>&emsp;Three shifts is a bit trickier, but upon reflection, isn't so damning. Like two shifts, the
                        rate
                        is denser, and thus you can appreciate your activity in it, along with the surrounding free time. Where
                        three shifts weighs on you though is in the blockier matter, where you more than likely have a larger
                        back
                        to back node, followed by a single. This is fine, and ought not be dreaded; but truly, such a state
                        holds
                        more prevalence to work, as that blocky node draws much address. While the double is merely a solid
                        block
                        with a large gap in between, or a fair spread of breaks between smaller nodes. This refelcts the peace
                        from
                        half shifts, as they draw little regard or fatigue. Single shifts always produce this in general. But
                        even a
                        single that sees a block ahead is more weighing, as you cannot repreive into the single ease, with that

                        Lifes broader remarks draw me to both hopefully and fairly anend. It is near obvious to me that our care
                        for
                        the former comes from feelings and or regards born from our distant self: whereby the natural unease and
                        shiftness bring with it aims and concerns correspondant to it. While our stronger sides, which writing
                        tends
                        to bring out, hold more solid bounties. Though, without the promises of our mind, there may not be
                        something
                        so definite to attend. The honest remark then, is that of that which prodds at us now, ought we reflect
                        and
                        attend to this, in and of it self. For it is one thing to be balanced, but unsure of life's greater
                        ways.
                        And another to be so unbalanced, but by such uneveness amend.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am left then is with the solem remark that our public aims are neither ill sought, but
                        not
                        so steady, in origin or interest. "It is our duty to ourselves though, to be stable enough, as our near
                        efforts and choices are concerned, to be set and ready to see things, and of them, renark. For we are
                        left
                        otherwise bowing ourselves to false imagery and concepts: all bridled by the illusions dangled by the
                        future. And, as said, learning about yourself and the world, and properly tieing the two together as to,
                        in
                        the extent that you are so broadly concerned, amend, is so, that being as to cultivate and harvest such
                        sense, holds the line of right, as to do with you."

                        acquaint myself with the circumstances, as to bear any weight, and through habit iron it out; and

                        I think back, and Simron was the only person I'd give myself to. I felt no nerves around her, as I had
                        no
                        fear of hiding. I was able to be what was required for her: for of her I saw, and felt somehow, she saw
                        me.
                        <br>&emsp;This was so for I felt she was a good person. Someone who followed the rules, not out of fear
                        or
                        pride, but because it was fair and decent. I knew this, because when I messed up, she would laugh at me,
                        as
                        if we were supposed to be doing it well, and it was merely the course of such wellness, that it was not
                        hard, but natural: and so worht a laugh when you messed up: for she was already disposed to such a line,
                        and
                        all things out of norm were not so damning: as she was not held there by fear or pride.

                        When I think of work, I see two sides: time and volume. For one, you may not be able to work weekends,
                        or
                        afternoons. For this I can say any works. For the other, this amounts to the extend of your involvment.
                        For
                        whatever way you may or not work, so is there an amount to such involvment. We are not looking for full
                        time, nor can we do four shifts regularly. I can adapt, but despite being able to do three per week, two
                        is
                        prefereable, and in fact all I'm looking for --and by that need.
                        <br>&emsp;This is a quaint ideal, when you consider that it is merely the volume of an otherwise general
                        kind of work. Short shifts is possible, but earned over time, or at oppertune points. Simply settling
                        into a
                        certain amount of work is not so troublesome. And as much as we are not settled, so will fortitude bear
                        us
                        through it; or at least, not be so weighing by the advantage we gleam from it, and the specks of
                        enjoyment
                        and good in the actual task. Over time, habit will even out all, and more than likely, accomodate our
                        preference. "For it is one thing to hope for me, and trust fortune to grant you such; and another to
                        hope
                        for less, and by that, be granted the simple privalage of being invovlved, but not so much."

                        The world is a remarkable place. Indeed our judgements come to pass, when we see all the variety of
                        elements: and the according sense that in that, lies so much bad.
                        <br>&emsp;But we not ought start here though. As we are more than likely ignorant of all the proportions
                        and
                        sides of most matters; and along with that, subject more to impulse and prejudice, rather than clear
                        thinking.
                        <br>&emsp;Because of this, I'd state that the world ought be know in total, but upon a sensible approach
                        guilded with propiety and reproach. For it is one thing to try and fail, or have no where to go upon
                        admitting what you don't know; and another to be two steps ahead of where you have any right to be, or
                        to be
                        so concluded, and or deprived, as not to even begin.
                        <br>&emsp;To begin, we must assert fundementals. For all attempts to define and know end up in models,
                        whereby the elements and motion of things get catalogued into various assortments of systems and terms.
                        The
                        weakness here is that we loose the esscence of the very things which were trying to concieve. For it is
                        one
                        thing to define matter, and by that, assign some indeluble sentiment of being --by which said matter is
                        apart of. But such a sentiment ought not hold its own indefinable esteem. "For we may error in
                        attribution
                        to the thing defined, by something which, in all fairness, is used as if also defined, but not actually
                        so."
                        Moreover, we must also consider whether such sentiments are not themselves inseperable from the subjects
                        which we concieve. For how else can we prescribe the being of an object, and not fall prey to the
                        identity
                        fallacy: whereby the object in question, in being, is held to be so by some indefinable sentiment of
                        being:
                        but how is an object which cannot be but besides such sentiment of being, be so, if it is not of some
                        sort
                        already? "The infinite infinite."
                        <br>&emsp;I must admitt our approach is short of any credulity, and by that, merrit in bowing to. But I
                        can
                        say that with fair observation and solid sense, we can erode the brittle neccessities of the past, and
                        more
                        amply prop up the point where theory and questioning begins.
                        <br>&emsp;I might start here, but in an all to bumbling way; or maybe there, but in a way that even I'm
                        not
                        clear on. So we'll simply say, as Socrates similarly held, that all investigative matters begin with
                        terms.
                        For we need to know what were talking about in order to ask questions, and notably progress. Herein
                        though
                        lies the conflict. For the greatrest mystery's of our day are how anything is at all, be it life,
                        physics,
                        the mind. And, admittedly, this has been the focal point of past inquiries as well. It is those rugged
                        neccessities though, whereby little of the past's claims were built on not but a few esteemed
                        observations;
                        and, as one who in fact knows little cuts corners to fill in the holes, so were these deepest questions
                        solved with a brevity that could match the ultimate emptiness of such claims. For the world is indeed a
                        mystery. And even upon our modern observations, 'so the depths further go'. The issue, is that the
                        phenomena
                        needing an explantion are not so different. And by the granduer of such mysteries, so do the awnser need
                        equal breadth. Only, what we know of the world, on the whole and as pertains to said mysteries, is so
                        much
                        contemporaily, that our suppostions need not fill in but the meagerest wholese; in comparison that is to
                        the
                        gapeing casms of which the past held. For in those times, physics was not naturally understood, nor
                        biology,
                        or geology, or chemistry to any moderate degree. And undernstandibly, as we do in our current day,
                        suppositions were made, as to what could explain the world as we deemed it. And I hold no begrudgement
                        over
                        those whose according suppositions were so comapratively innacurate, as they knew so little. I think,
                        all in
                        all, it makes sense, and ougbt not be surprising. It's the reverence though, or credulity, of either
                        myth or
                        tradition, and its cementing of such views, which holds our target of scrutiny. For it is one thing to
                        know
                        little of the world, yet still ask, and by that, come up with deranged anwsers. Empedocles suggested
                        that
                        the earth was made of fire and wind, and indeed, this is a wrong view. But it attempts at least; and
                        beyond
                        that, actually holds with it some fair sentiment, namely in the elemental divesity which things
                        seemingly
                        full are made of. Democritus took this even further, claiming something akin to our own atomic view of
                        the
                        world. The innacuracy ought not be admitted, or heralded, but we can at least respec the inquiry, and by
                        that, sensibility which folded the pieces in an respectable way: even if the pieces were made of dirt
                        and
                        clay.

                        So the issue in all this is one of progress. For if we start with our observations, as to even know what
                        were explaining, and with some privalage, extend this notion of our senses, as if we are only aware of
                        them
                        by within the domain of observation, then we can say, that progressively, that all our explanations
                        ought so
                        far oblige, as to align with the observations so far.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, there is the matter of which observations are accepted; moreose, what observations are
                        actually so, and not premises built from unchecked or absent observation: and conclusions at that.
                        "Hereby,
                        the line of modern and old concepts lie."
                        <br>&emsp;We might say there are many reasons to remain sketpical, if not inquisitive. For it may be all
                        too
                        easy to say, 'this thing which I fully see and am impressed by, cannot be explained but for this reason:
                        even if this means there is something neccessary, or in other words, 'ethereal'.' Yet, if we establish a
                        fair measure of observation, we may either refute such claim, as to its appeal to inplausibility that
                        something coulnd not be the explanation: for it may not be so neccessary. Or, and this is modernitites
                        further growning claim, that the thing you claim to see, is in fact not so as you identify. And so yes,
                        the
                        planets may need the Gods to orbit them, for based on their motions --which may all be fairly assessed--
                        that so could nothing but a divine mover do so. But the baser truth, is that planets are nothing but
                        dense
                        dust, born from the even denser bits of a star ---itself a clump within a stellar cloud. And indeed, the
                        true explanation for these is not known, and perhaps in that, God's hand lie. "But we may fairly refute
                        those who say that such hand is guiding an apparent thing, when in fact, there is nothing truly of the
                        sort
                        being guided."

                        and more or less, did not make it clear I was available anytime. I felt confident though. I phoned back
                        three days later, and he said 'they were going with someone else'. I felt dissapointed, a little
                        frustrated.
                        In the moment, I uttered out as to why this occured, and he said it was to do with the schedule. This
                        felt
                        like a failure on my part. I had emailed him after the interview, exclaiming that I was fine with full
                        shifts; but in retrospect, I had not made it clear I could work anytime. I tried to affirm whether or
                        not
                        there'd be oppertunity later on, and I gleamed that after christmas it would be so. At the end of
                        November,
                        I called Dev to clarify that I could work anytime, to set the record straight.
                        <br>&emsp;So December went by, and I was not sure when to phone. My ease had set me on the first week of
                        January, but as New Years was approaching I felt a nervous haste, and phoned Dev. He was suprisingly
                        happy
                        to hear from me, and said that when things picked up we could come in then. This was what was meant when
                        I
                        had affirmed the possibility prior. Fairly clearly, he said to phone him at the end of the month. This
                        worked well for me, and generally, I felt well.
                        <br>&emsp;January has gone by, and for the most part I've been well. Similar to the end of December I
                        was
                        beginning to feel a nerous haste. I made a passing call on Saturday, and Dev was unavailable. Funnily
                        enough, I went to Superstore that afternoon and nearly ran in to him; but I missed speaking to him. On
                        Monday morning I phoned, Dev picked up, I said it was Ryan Green and that I was checking in; he said
                        that he
                        was meaning to call me, and that I should apply online. He mentioned that I had already been through the
                        interview process, and so, despite setting some sort of meeting/coming in, it was not alike the initial
                        interview: as I had already been vetted. I went on Loblaws, found a part-time listing for Personal
                        Shopper
                        at Superstore, applied, and all was well. I emailed Dev noting this. He replied asking me to confirm my
                        availability. I sent a reasonably long email, beginning with the fact that I could work anytime, but in
                        terms of volume, I preferred to work 2 shifts per week; but I could work 3 if need be, and that I just
                        wanted to be transparent. I ended the email exclaiming 'I can work anytime, anyday, I just prefer 2
                        shifts/week, but 3 is fine'. He did not respond that day. I was nervous about this, simply waiting for
                        him
                        to reply. I had the sense that I'd said to much, and perhaps limited myself to what he would care for. I
                        phoned around noon, as I nomrally planned to, and he was not in that day. Weirdly, less than 5 minutes
                        after, I got an email from the loblaw automaic messenger saying I've got an interview scheduled for the
                        following day. Then a email came immediately after, saying it had been cancelled, and that 'due to
                        circumstances', my recruitment process was being voided. On the intial email it says Dev is the
                        interview;
                        but the email was not from him. I am left to believe that he saw my response, felt it restrictive, and
                        elected to void my application. Only, I sent this yesterday. And I have not received an email back;
                        which is
                        not itself an absolute ceratin in any case. But considering that he is not there today, it would be
                        strange
                        if he had somehow orchestrated that interview, having seen my response ---for if he did not, then what
                        would
                        explain his sentiment-- and from there cancelled it and the application.

                        As a man, I an a bit of a fraud. As I spend too much of my time dreaming, or fortifying myself against
                        issues not there. Too little do I commit myself to anything wortwhile, at least soemthing which matters.
                        Indeed, my dreams center on such topics, but the aim I see is not so as reflects the things which
                        propiate
                        the worth; nor is my intent, and by that lasting stride, made with much care for the obejcts of such
                        worth,
                        but rather of my own. "I dream of saving the world, showing them the way, but all because I am idle, and
                        pleased upon being king, rather than making use of it."
                        <br>&emsp;In this our life is mixed and astray. As beyond our common paces and their sprouting state, we
                        are
                        not with any greater amends: be it to children, community, our selves even.
                        <br>&emsp;Literaily, I spend much time, as writing is a way that brings more life outside of our idel
                        state.
                        Amd do, as a weight against our younger years, does it humble and station our lofty imagination.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am always left is in trying to define the peace upon death, and thereby contempt to
                        the
                        fears and fretting marbling its traditional esteem. Seeing life this way, brings much irrevence for
                        things
                        of a novel sort, and orients you towards more rich and generous things: be it for your own heart and
                        toil,
                        or of people.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I come to pass though, is that there is a complex of pedantry and obscurity. With no ill
                        intent or wicked minds to be fair, but rather a simply an appeal of the past and a lack of honesty as to
                        what best serves our understanding now. God sits here, like a 800 year old porch chair, ricketing, and
                        by
                        that bearing sounds which warrant his claim; yet when you sit on it, the wood and bolts begin to split
                        and
                        crack. "And weirdly, everyone, more or less, has their own view of this chair, and as it were, fight one
                        another to sit in their own view, and in the process defimate those of others. But all because of this
                        fear
                        of death, and the derived concepts of benevolence by those who (in a baser way) soothe such fear."
                        <br>&emsp;It's just hard to imagine economies and governments functioning properly, even under the load
                        of
                        the gritted past, when those invovleve are not equally human. "As such matters are enlivened through
                        social
                        action: but for the requisite communication and invovlement to occur, ought each member be clear of the
                        other. And as is all to common, burn anyone who is not up to par, or congenial rather for the system,
                        and
                        root them out. 'My purity is bound by the arrangements of me and my fellow brethren: such a formation
                        bears
                        us the stability and riches to thrive. But for the sake of such form, ought we both propietous in our
                        personal conduct, as to warrant our place within, but along with that mend any shortcomings of those who
                        do
                        not meet such standard, and in effect weigh the system down'. Such a sentiment is fair, as rats, all be
                        animals with no evil to sport, ought still be treated as vermin, if it is a matter of people succumbing
                        to
                        filth and disease. Root em out. 'Who are the rats though? Who would not fit in, and by that, earn our
                        collective warrant, as to be equitable into our scale for who we preserve for? Who would not be eligble
                        to
                        rid evil for the sake of? Who would not merrit a place amongst those who merely care to survive?'.
                        Indeed,
                        the rats have more clarity as a threat, then seemingly comparable people."

                        It seems a good place to begin, in that we'd mention that the worth of any remark is in that it means
                        something; and generally, this is so, when the quality of our experience is in question. For we may see
                        the
                        ripest of fruits, but out of hands reach: and so we convene to bridge the gap. Or we may be suffering
                        wounds
                        or famine, and by that, work to overcome the pain and depravity. Our souls even, as often treated, are
                        but
                        aspects of us which draw their own concern. Collectively even, our place amidst the whole may bear our
                        amends: as we tailor our point amidst all others.
                        <br>&emsp;For it's usefullness, I tend to work from the sentiment of positivity, which says that, in all
                        things, they move and grow as remarks there orientation within those stated regards: that as mechanics
                        have
                        made them, or their mind and heart whist them to be, so are they moved and sent. Satisfaction compares
                        slightly with comfort, as does inflammation compare with grueling pain. Each are but practical
                        experiences
                        within that natural course, 'whereby the base of things produces ostensibly varied forms of good and
                        bad'.
                        <br>&emsp;To begin then, I'd state that logic is but a behavorial addition to our otherwise living
                        state. As
                        fdr how we think and concieve, and cohoerently, is one thing. But the exhibition of ourselves, be it as
                        we
                        laudily proclaim, or through impulse, is what matters. It is true, that perhaps coming to sight of real
                        knowledge is the greatest thing; but so may we be off in how we see such end, as being so right; for we
                        may
                        in fact be so far off of actually being, at least in the adjoining part of us which is unsubject to such
                        concieving ---ie. our bodies; and as such, so may the end which we seek in terms of knowledge, be
                        entirely
                        unfounded, 'as one's who are elsewhere alive to hoist up our conception --less those may think without a
                        head---may not in fact be so sound in such concpetion, when their living matters are stilted'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt that this raises the issue of the mind's ambiguity, and whether or not it is of the
                        body, be it together, or of some comparable sort. For if it is, then we are merely left with a generally
                        accepted whole of bodies, which together, as bodies, are equally subject to the inquiry of how bodies
                        are at
                        all. If the mind is not so comaprable, though it would be hard for one to identify what it is then, as
                        to
                        then denote what is not in fact a body, then the realms of our inquiry which relate the basis of bodies,
                        may
                        itself be what our mind springs from, but in an extended way, rather than force ---for which natural
                        mechanics are contrived from. That, or there may be seperate non-body realms; or better yet, the realm
                        which
                        the mind is associated with, and a associately derived realm by which the bodies are based on. "The
                        sheathe
                        of matter resting upon, or perhaps entirely foregin, to the sheathe of the mind."

                        The basis for all inquiry is in whether or not any matter of concern can be deemed positivley, or if
                        there
                        is to some extent, a need to suppose. Indeed, there would be reason for all things if we could describe
                        them
                        so postively. While the belief that there is some neccessity, and by that, contrivance, is more in line
                        with
                        oughts. One may say that of that which houses the whole of things, so would it be a certain way. Beyond
                        the
                        weakness of the encumbant lack of positivity, so is there a) no greater positivity when it comes to such
                        neccessary matters, and b) a sort of faintness to any absolute assertion regarding locig, so far is it
                        pertains to how the world is made and governed. "It is either a poor claim, or one whose merrits I am
                        ignorant of, that anything must be, for all we see as evident could not be so. This relies on the
                        identity
                        of such evidence, which is, to the point, unknown." But we are left then, ultimately perhaps resting on
                        the
                        esteem of evidence; which to a degree is fair, and is worth some minimal concession. But all in favor of
                        some conjuring intelligence which orders and governs all. And it is odd for this to have grounds outside
                        of
                        some evidence, 'for which it it is esteemed as propiating'. Indeed, there is a rear end to that, for
                        which
                        there is no need for evidence. But of this, I cannot quite say what it is we think is there. In some
                        sense,
                        it is as if the world which is claimed to be goverend by something baser was absent, and such a base was
                        there inherently.
                        <br>&emsp;To reiterate our argument, the world is either known posivitely, or through some mixture of
                        this
                        and contrivance. Or, there is no world, neccesarily at least. But so lies that realm which would
                        contrive,
                        floating is goes. "A world made and run by God; the faith in reason barring the belief in the latters
                        unneccessity; and God alone, in and of a manner unpertaining to the world. I am not sure though how we
                        know
                        God alone."

                        So, as trouble approaches, or circumstance, I look for every good thing around to smother it. For
                        whichever
                        reason, this takes my mind off the work to come.
                        <br>&emsp;When there is nothing to desire though, the work feels brazen, immediate, and consuming.
                        <br>&emsp;Worth remarking then, is how this toil can be endured through fortitude and, eventually,
                        habit.
                        These drain the looming effect of work, and otherwise make the prescence of it milder.
                        <br>&emsp;I think life ought pay attention to this notion, as indeed, some dream and wonder, and by
                        that,
                        seek security and refuge. While others may simply be unbothered, be it by privalge or their own
                        strenght.
                        But it has never ceased upon me, that what I see and care for changes whether I am emablmed with desire,
                        or
                        abscence of stress.

                        So we say that the cosmic microwave backgorund is an observation, in the way that we observe the light
                        from
                        Alpha Centauri. The CBM is merely a spherical impression of light from all positions, coming from a time
                        that the complexion of the light suggests.
                        <br>&emsp;This is no law though. Just as the orbit of moon around the earth is no law, merely something
                        we
                        observe.
                        <br>&emsp;I will grant leniance to what laws mean, if only to effectively describe them. But of there
                        general nature, I cannot quite say. You have the second law of thermodynamics for instance, which says
                        that
                        all harmonious states tend towards dissaray. "A clump of particles in a chamber will proceed to
                        distriubte
                        themselves evenly, rather than come together." This is what we observe though. And laws, it would seem,
                        are
                        simply coinded deductions, of what occurs under certain circumstances. In this way, laws are esteemed as
                        the
                        cause, in their being a law, as repeated observations are brought by.
                        <br>&emsp;In this sense, laws are pronounced as a basis, or cause rather; as if a solid guess, or
                        inference,
                        to the prescence of something, 'of which the law is a denotion of', for which our observations are
                        explained
                        by. "It is as if a dark hole lay by your side, and every time you dropped a ball in, it came back up.
                        After
                        repeated attempts, you may say there is some undubitable cause which bears such effect: the law of ups
                        if
                        you will. Yet, you do not surely know if it is but a bend of gravity shooting it up, or some pig headed
                        troll."
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, we are left with laws of varied degrees. For it is one thing to describe
                        bioligical
                        laws, 'in that we see animals behave so concurently', and another as to the physical laws which govern
                        these.
                        <br>&emsp;For what we are left with, is a deepening stamp on nature, whereby the phenomena we see are
                        understood to a finer degree. We cannot say the basic cause of such, only, that of the things we see,
                        that
                        nature is so that, by our repeated observations, equal results occur ---varying but in proportion. But
                        of
                        this thing which we esteem as the cause of our observations, so is it unknown.

                        In a quaint room, amidst a calm green country, sat a group of gentleman. Inclined to study and share,
                        they
                        conversed with one another, detailing their recent wonderments. But whereas these sort of occasions
                        tended
                        to be full of profession and prognostics, the mood of this was slighty dapper. For after a time, in
                        which
                        those former described the talk, one of the men simply remarked how ill-founded their statements were.
                        Not
                        that they were ill-placed in fairness or sentiment; nor were they lacking any weight behind their gusts.
                        Merely, he suggested that the heart of their inputs lacked any insight as to whether or not they were
                        wrong.
                        It was mere words being spoken, and little judgement or doubt flown about. Better yet, there was little
                        admission to the vainess in their proclomations, in that, upon considering the past, it was clear how
                        much
                        any prior time was futily wrong. "None so rightly fortold."
                        <br>&emsp;From this remark, the converse shifted, setting moreso on the simplicity of the world, and
                        how,
                        despite our prior claims and speaking, so was it likely to samely remain. Indeed the future is a
                        mystery,
                        and certain shifts will occur. "But a man, despite aging, never looses his heart, or bones."
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, their more humbled and calm remarks centered on the state of the world, and how,
                        in
                        the decades prior, the fortelling was that it would burn in hell; or at least whither into something
                        dystopic. The reality could not be further from that.
                        <br>&emsp;Crime remains, as does depravity. There is rudeness, brevity, pedantry and shame. Nor are the
                        bones of man invincibly secure. There could be war, as are its ways increasingly burning its sides.
                        <br>&emsp;But in all of this, the gentleman attested to the fact, that in all metrics, the world had
                        improved. Of all things risky and hazardous, so are they less severe. And despite certain threats being
                        par
                        for modernity, so is the positive side of such mountanous in comparison. The norms remain, as is the
                        earth
                        beneath us. But the stability which people seek, is more widespread, and not so exclusive. "A far rarity
                        it
                        seems, for a nation not to be as first as the last."
                        <br>&emsp;And, wrapping it all up, one of the men illustrated a reasonable way to understand this
                        scenario.
                        He described the phenoman of technology, and how the prospects of it always excite one to imagine, and
                        by
                        that, dream of the world changing. But little is this feeling ever checked by the smoothness of the
                        past,
                        and how revolutionary change bolts itself onto the mundanity of normal things. Moreose, that these
                        heralded
                        prospects, tend to be unremarked as they settle into the norm; from which the eveness of the world is
                        gleamed, and only some other spark to our imagination can changed that.
                        <br>&emsp;The point of their converse then, was that, despite the expected change, it will not be so
                        stark
                        when the whole of things is accounted for. Governements will be governemnts, as will economies and
                        markets
                        function similarly. There will borders, tress, the sun and the moon. And even upon our dreams being met,
                        will we still need to breathe, or more actively seek food and friendship. "Blade Runner ought to have
                        been
                        set in 2525."

                        As it were, the state of the world was such, that near the end of the century, so was it relatively the
                        same, if not improved. "And perhaps as nicely so, the imaginations of folk had been rendered of, 'like
                        the
                        grissle on a steak'. And as such, there proclivitiy to dream and believe, was more tenured and factual."
                        As
                        such, few see the world a hundred years from now to be to remarkably different. In the century prior,
                        the
                        ability to see all was given, 'yet none had the fidelity or sense to do use it well'. "For which the end
                        felt so near." But as time went on, and the pillars of modernity settled in, so did the norm become one
                        with
                        such advents, 'to which prospects of a similar sort were relatively less remarkable'. "Computers felt
                        like
                        they'd take us into a world so different and prestine; while now, near the top of the century, the
                        imagery
                        of time travel does not blind our view to the things which'd still be common: that we'd be men,
                        breathing,
                        hungry and tired: nor so bored as to care where we invovled ourselves. It is a modern treat, that no
                        where
                        is deemed special, to marvel at beauty, be delighted, and in harmony with folk and friend. 'Take me no
                        where'."

                        Oddly though, this modern norm is not so prestine. For despite its promise of a constance to whats
                        common,
                        and improvements at that, there are still those outside this stream of cheer. In proportion things
                        differ,
                        and that is modernity claim. But still the form remains, in that, to whichever degree, there are still
                        those
                        who steal, who rape, who murder: and not as nearly a concern, but rumours and gospel are no less
                        present.
                        Man may have bruoght those in the mud into the smoothest of streets, but so a hole remains. Part of this
                        modern sensibility, of basic sameness, does relish in the fact that of those in the hole, so are there
                        less
                        so. Along with the cadence of this, 'as more folk are being lifted out than ever before'. Yet, it still
                        haunts one to think that there are those in such despair. And indeed, the prior times ramblings and fear
                        was
                        significantly motivated by this fact: that there were those in need, 'for which the world was to blame
                        for'.
                        And even though the world has shown that she is willing to help, and is more than likely to remain
                        normal
                        and secure, so is she subject to scrutiny, and insecurity. For these remarks of mine are not made as to
                        say,
                        that all in modern life are happy and pure, while those in the hole are merely calm and waiting. There's
                        still a dispotion to our freedoms which has not yet flourished. Nor, has there been a blossoming of the
                        culture, as to mightily reflect our modern state. "People may not be as put off by other's squabblings
                        and
                        pedantry, for of the norm, they know. Yet still the squabbling lays."

                        So civ is coming out. It is 90$ standard. I will be buying this. I have a chunk of change at Coast, near
                        1800$ in TD ---with no more charges. We get 200 in April and July. And we've just become employed --with
                        no
                        current expenses. So I'll pay for this.
                        <br>&emsp;The question, is whether we buy the deluxe edition. The founders edition has more dlc coming,
                        but
                        in the summer, while the deluxe DLC comes shortly after launch. Admittedly, there are so many Civs as it
                        is,
                        so these new ones won't be fixing any absence. So for 40$ for, you can play 9pm on Wedensday, or wait

                        I'm
                        thinking of the Hammerfall area, and the northern coast around, moving then to the western flats. The
                        jungles and eastern mountains have Griffins and airforce, and somewhere between that lies a ocean

                        Asking questions is satisfying, as the whole world feels infront of you. Similar to a stressed moment,
                        where
                        the elements of your life get twisted and show only their harshest glare, so in a state of inquiry and
                        cheer, do you see broadly and nicely. The love of outdoors come's to pass, 'as if a prisoner, despite
                        their
                        seclsion, was still graced by the sun, or moon, the birds even'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt though, that when we are not so cheery, or able to happily see, we get burdened by
                        something along the lines of sympathy. For none who are truly occupied care for, or are wounded by the
                        chimera's of man or animal's plight. But as someone who is quite deep in their sights, so is a posture
                        which
                        cannot stand to it, one which retains the domain; but in that, holds onto things, or at least, gets
                        intruded
                        with things, in a less fair or pleasing fashion. "For my world, as I see it, becomes part of me, like
                        that
                        prisoner, who remarks upon their entrapment with the prescence of things aruond it; for which we
                        similarly
                        hold our peace by the sun and moons prescence."
                        <br>&emsp;The geography of discourse though is rampant in these parts. And, while I have a large and
                        spanning view of things, so is it more of a model, rather than a exact understanding of any particular
                        point. Suggestions then unravel me, as I have much familiarity with the subjects, but not their matter.
                        And
                        so, the loose story telling or commentary on such regards has a spot within me, in which it settles: but
                        there is not meat on the bone so to speak, 'to which the impression does so fully upon me'.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, in my finer strides, these inputs don't have as easy of access, as the spots we
                        have
                        wihch are more filled out, give a general aura of being filled. "Like the contributions of a forest upon
                        the
                        atmospehre, whereby its local point drifts up into the encompassing whole, blocking out the sun."
                        <br>&emsp;What I can say then, is that we are burned with sympathy. For our knowledge has exposed us to
                        the
                        condensed nature of cultural digestion, and therein exaserbated our imperfections, 'wherein such inputs
                        come
                        in more heavily: because our general knowledge has given space, upon our vulnerability to impression
                        that
                        is'.

                        I think the heart of intent draws from the relationship to our dad, who is someone that I love in some
                        sense, but fear in another. For he is the one person who is always telling me what to do; and holds a
                        certain strenght and authoirty to do so.
                        <br>&emsp;But as one gets older, they are either a) less receptive, or b) better able to communicate
                        when
                        you disagree.
                        <br>&emsp;I bring this up though because of a similar relationship I have with the world. Simply, there
                        is a
                        suggestion sometimes that it is off, or at least in need of assistance. And my common experience doesn't
                        jive with that; and I am somewhat positive of what is true otherwise.
                        <br>&emsp;From this, I wish to better state things, for our sensibility is merely a means to ignore
                        things,
                        or be unpertubred by them. While knowledge is about solidity, in that even the roughest push could not
                        move
                        you. In the former's case, akin to happiness and peace, you are simply less struck by things, and by
                        that,
                        less prone to being drug by drama and fluff. But if you are busy or tired, or at that stressed, then you
                        become more rigged, and more likleey to have impressions cling onto you. "Where they might otherwise
                        slip
                        off." Of our regards then, so our knowledge lies. For whatever we are attending to, there is not but
                        what we
                        know which can be used for refutation. Indeed, we may known things in a light or impartial way; or,
                        considering the question at hand, peraps its form is made based on your 'rugged tone', to which the
                        knowledge needed is absent. In this, we say, that be it smooth and normal, or rough and tumbly, that the
                        iumpression dealt with be consented to or overted, based on the knoweldge you have. "Does this line up,
                        fit
                        nicely, or is it far off, and right to remove."
                        <br>&emsp;Where we come to then, is the matter of positivity, in that, of the world, we truly see, and
                        by
                        that, hold room for even the most ill-set and pointed impressions.
                        <br>&emsp;As is the world bent along the inquiry of need or reason, so is life bent along the submission
                        to
                        ease and negativity. In one, you have concerns about whether the world as seen, and further so, is what
                        remarks how the world is, and by this, how our actions should lie. That, or whether this is implausible,
                        and
                        a baser impetus is required to make, what may otherwise seem evident, so. "And whether someone can know
                        what
                        such impetus is, fairs a sort of reason itself: as if one proclaimed the motions of sea, and things
                        within
                        it. But all more likely, that the neccessities proclaimed were made in fallacy, and not thereby known."
                        We'd
                        say in this case, that the need for the sea to be what explains the objects in it, or rather, that the
                        objects needed a sea, or basis, to be as they seem, for them to be so, did not rightly explain how such
                        basis was, for, of the objects which it was the cause, or basis for, so were such objects, via our lack
                        of
                        faith in reason, with an identity which was naturally so; to which, we defame any baser claim, when such
                        claim was made with the complexion of such basis in mind, rather than the mere neccessity of one; which
                        is
                        so, for the source for what we describe such basis on, is of the objects which it, in a deemed
                        complexion,
                        is so as to correspond with, in the way it is, as to produce, throught such of form of it's, the form of
                        objects which it is the proposed cause for.
                        <br>&emsp;The point being, that the need for a baser explanation, or impetus rather, is merely so if the
                        world is deemed to be unexplainable otherwise. "Contrasting one's faith in reason." While this is fair
                        in
                        principle, to propose at least via the skepticism of that which we mean to describe, so is the abscence
                        of
                        that lacking a block to any proposition which proclaims the nature, or rather form, of such basis. There
                        are
                        proper arguments as to what such basis would be, but merely on the matter, or principle rather, of there
                        neccessarily being something at all, and by that -devoid of what there is, potentially or as seen- how
                        it's
                        form would be. But as we know such form based on what we suppose the inherent being is, we cannot claim
                        to
                        know how it is with relation to objects derived from it, when such objects are (in this case)
                        definitively
                        unknown. "As saying they are so (undefined), is how we draw the conlcusion of their neccessary impetus."
                        And
                        it is a fallacy indeed, to remain unclear of motion and substance, as we'd deem whole and natural, but
                        therein describe the arbitrary force stated as being the explanation for that which we don't know, or
                        feel
                        can be fairly said, discovered or known, and therein ascribe properties to such force which are drawn
                        from a
                        relation to an effect which they are --in the manner of their form-- to be esteemed as causing.

                        vice, whereby I ruslte and stir, knowning I've erroed, and am apt to continue.
                        <br>&emsp;We are no man though. For a man is one who is truly like this, rightfully happy. While I am
                        one,
                        though perhaps wise, is but someone who's tasted the sweetness of this happiness, and danced towards her
                        tune. But in our imperfection, we slip and drag a little, yielding to an admittedly honorable brace to
                        what's good, and not an retreat into what's bad. But in this brace, as all those committmed naturally
                        feel,
                        there lies an all to flat reverence for the process of right being, or an all to gripping hold on the
                        good
                        it springs.
                        <br>&emsp;For in our delight, as virtue springs in us, we see the moon and sun, the trees and stars. And
                        as
                        we rest genlty, but tenderly too as our mind alights, we mellow into a full embrace, of our standing and
                        sights around. We are one, upright and privy.
                        <br>&emsp;But these sights, like peak scenes from a mountain top, become handles which we hold onto when
                        we
                        are not so postured. When we slump, we miss those things so charmingly dear, and hold onto the pinnacle
                        vista's. Worth noting, is that in our wandering ways, that not always are we privy to such magic.
                        Equally
                        are we composed, but perhaps subject to mere chirp of a bird, or calm scope of the land. These don't
                        settle
                        in us as the richest of vibrnaces, but merely broaden our appeal, and thus experience. This should be
                        fine,
                        as our posture, be it delighted by the Gods or his simple lands below, happily flows in and out of such
                        scenery. But when our posture tightens and we can no longer see things simply, we concentrate our gaze
                        and
                        change position, as to see those more wonderful things. "As we feel either empty, or drawn to the
                        plastic
                        abyss below."

                        I'm not bitter, nor pessemistic; and never have been. For all our misgivings, none of them seem to occur
                        but
                        by an apparent fault. We've always experienced the opposite of this, and to such means, disposed
                        ourselves
                        towards. But of all things bad, there is never something which, I'd admitt, as not being wrong.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, one may simply ask themselves, in whichever way they feel and seem, would it not
                        likely
                        be so that the worst of this was such, if any given parameter was present? Would you not lose sleep and
                        concentration from eating poorly or not exercising? What if your merely slept late, or missed a walk
                        prior,
                        or ended up with a blanket? Our experience has only shonw us such.
                        <br>&emsp;I say this, for what is good bears itself through choices which, upon their lapse, blurr such
                        goods: to which we learn. But, as remarked in the past, the beginnings of such regards usually begin
                        with a
                        stoutness to such fidelity, and only so. Then, as these matters become normal, so do we focus on the
                        goods
                        born from them, giving them more catered time and attention --as we did the means.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a confusion though, namely of whether we can be aimed for such goods, and thus their
                        mean. For any doubt of this, or imposition, will lead one astray. And, generally, by whichever heart
                        that is
                        proposed to such ends, so do they move to such through thicket and mud, 'heading the contempt and
                        scrutiny
                        of others'. Since these are but words, and act more like oncoming winds, rather than halting storms, so
                        do
                        we proceed rather fully. But, since there is such friction, or tilting of our aim, so in practice do we
                        take
                        our goods and bank them on meeting such. Which is to say, that of the pressures we face, so do the
                        pieces
                        which stick to us curry our interests to be aimed at such. At least, we humour both our heart and that
                        of
                        success --for which were scorned against.

                        The mist noticable thing is your sleep. Waking up late is quite poor, as is not going for a walk. A
                        blanket
                        ought be used either a) following your initial sleep, or b) if you purely would like it. You need not be
                        averse, but cater yourself to do without, by wearing warm socks, the right jacket, and with the lamp
                        light
                        by your side. I contend that waking up early is so beneficial, that watching a movie or playing a game
                        may
                        occur instead of immediately going for a walk.
                        <br>&emsp;As walking after workouts, along with catching your breathe is good, so is walking prior. The
                        notion goes, that the later your up, the more you have to do, to get up to speed. The issue with waking
                        up
                        late, is that your body has not eaten, but is not in any lively state; and so your hungry, but then
                        slowed.
                        In that, you have to work so much in a short amount of time. Extending this, waking up at a moderate
                        time
                        allows for an immediate followed by subsquent walk, each moderatley short. Waking up early can extend
                        that
                        initial walk; thoug, whether you take a second, or have a long one initially is unclear to me. Waking up
                        early may not faciliate training.
                        <br>&emsp;White bread is obviously killer, but raisin bagels can delight. English muffins are quire
                        whole,
                        but soft whole wheat can be nice. Naan is fairly whole, despite its whiteness, but so a good treat it
                        bays.
                        Crackers are mostly poor, some poison. But the hard wheat ones are not so off, like popcorn. Cereal has
                        never been great, as granola bars, but akin to natural chips, so is there fairer kinds; be it the kashi
                        nutrigrain, or basic quaker bars. Honey Nut is quite sugary, but ripe for the fairest decadence. Peanut
                        Butter granola may serve you better, though price is not terrific. Sometimes thinner kinds of food are
                        preferable over their counterparts, namely hasbrown patties over potatoes; as your care for one may be
                        just
                        in kind, and the simpler form may be what you need; as you'd otherwise wish for something of a fuller
                        sort.

                        I admitt the seperation of land and sea, as one is not so useful, nor benefited by much of the formers
                        gains. But for interest sake, so can it be made.
                        <br>&emsp;In general though, there are spots selected for certain hunts: be it wolves, raptors, terror
                        birds, allos, sarcos, griffins or wyverns. Rexes and things of the sort hold more of a utility, and not
                        of a
                        mobile but bracing sort.
                        <br>&emsp;To bear all this, one may live via industry, setting up bases where metal, obsidian and
                        crystal
                        can be claimed. The Quetzel may then be used as a mobile pen; but otherwise, little hunting compounds
                        can be
                        set up, to both hold your residence and tame storage. Breeding is not so pervasive in all species; so a
                        general station may be had; or one local to the tame in question at their respective spot, ie. wolves.
                        <br>&emsp;Because taming is at the core of our experience, kibble is needed. By that, we need egg
                        layers,
                        and plant growing, which in total, requires crystal for the greenhouse, and secure space for the
                        breeding.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of tools, a navy is paramount; as reaching and transporting materials is otherwise a
                        trouble. At that, a ready supply of munitions makes such travels possible. Alongside that are the actual
                        means to taming, namely sedation. Materials can provide solid means for darts, while basic gatherers and
                        assembly can make abundant narcotics (and munitions). Further in the progression lies the tranq gun,
                        which
                        is quite usefull for taming animals in harry scenarios; be it a griffin, a quetzel, wolves and deep sea
                        creatures. "Things in areas of danger, that more or less demand a hasty sedation. With kibble being the
                        prompt means to acquire them."
                        <br>&emsp;As for our travels, there is a novel strip of plains in the north; but it's otherwise blocked
                        by
                        the mountains south of it, and the rugged terrain seperating it and eastern plains. The bulk of the
                        south is
                        a forest, and a fairer inlet to the mountains. The northeast holds griffins and Wyverns, near Volcanic
                        lands. And linging the southwest is a massive jungle. The western strip holds a sea, dividing spots of
                        islands and peaks further out, and woodlands lining the rocky flats. This area is quite accessible, but
                        lacks an abundance of resources. There are spots of them around, but the lower parts of the world hold
                        the
                        most ---including the rich, yet hazardous lands of the desert far south.
                        <br>&emsp;Tames begin with moderate damage and health, scaling logarithmically. Player stats are
                        similar,
                        but more regressive, causing you to input more as your level increases. Breeding begins fast along with
                        maturing, slowing as time goes on. Plus, the nights get longer, requiring better lighting and mobile
                        protection. Dino levels begin at .33, going to .66 once you get muntions, then reaching a full state
                        once
                        your industry is settled. Tinkering with the Ark can be sometimes effective, othertimes not. It is easy
                        to
                        remove dinos, but not so much to increase their prominence. Though, total values can be changed, but not
                        so
                        easily for particular ones. Nor changing their particualr effectiveness. I used to think that adding
                        ultimate creatures would flesh out this concern, but this means the game is normal less you run across
                        these
                        creatures. The better choice, is to have less than daunting threats, yet improved ones, more common
                        throughout the land. More alphas, harder dinos, increased numbers making it more likely you come across
                        packs.

                        I know what it means to be happy. We are constantly so, and thus know.
                        <br>&emsp;But saying can be a problem, as the terms used to described it tend to come from different
                        seeds.
                        Virtue for instance, has this esteem and flair as the thing which brings happiness, but does not then
                        detail
                        what such thing it brings. Similarly, hard work and a sensible mind, will bring money and success; but
                        these, in fairness, ought be taken to mean, that more things can be acquired; and indeed we tend to
                        concieve
                        of this as owning a home. But herein lies the problem, in that of the former's case, the definite mean
                        is of
                        some object, rather than mode of being. For why is the object good? Is it not by it's relation to you,
                        and
                        how through it's use you are? What then is the thing which you'd wish to spring? Is it furry and might,
                        or
                        calm delight?
                        <br>&emsp;Most of my remarks settle on the ends of our actions. The confusion therein lies, in that such
                        attention is not about where my actions go, but rather where they've come, 'to ends already treated'. I
                        more
                        or less assume that I am not going to change. And despite our view of things being off, in complexion,
                        so do
                        things not change in themselves. And so I notice for instance, that certain foods make me soft and
                        mushy,
                        while other's bring vitality and strenght. I remember this, note it, and contend myself to act with such
                        in
                        mind. For we all mean to do well, and none differ in this. Where we differ is in what we consider good,
                        or
                        set for wellness. A glycemic food is apt to have a glycemic effect; and such effect may mingle with
                        other
                        motions, to which we simply say, with some objectivity, that within a given person, however those other
                        motions are, that of the involvement of something glycemic, so will any given food contribute such.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the amendment to concerns which treat us in happiness, rather than
                        remedying common problems present to everyone else. It is not wise in my view to worry about such
                        things,
                        but instead to turn one's cares to happier ends. There's a richness at least, when I attend to myself;
                        and
                        in doing so, there's little I imagine that those common troubles would matter to me.
                        <br>&emsp;I guess I can only be a man enough, as to be honest with myself, and be so apt and principled
                        as
                        not to be drug down by the squabblings of those around. For in those moments, when and where I notice,
                        that
                        so are we unable to contend with them, 'for of our honesty, so are the elements of it hard to state'.
                        That I
                        feel calm and delighted, full of rigor and deep breathes: such is hard to exclaim.
                        <br>&emsp;I find, in our fuller moments, that nothing is seen in unity, but in systems, fledging and
                        sprouting, 'akin to every fish and coral in a reef'. This removes both our presumption of how any
                        individual
                        thing is, and by that, what we can expect any individual thing to be; but also, that there is thereby no
                        whole of which our abscence of an indivudal part, collapses it. This is an odd physical property, in
                        that
                        things have motion via their relations; but not so much that there unified into a fabric, but instead
                        brought to motion in company. And indeed, it is not unclear that all impacts the rest. But that any one
                        motion is here because of some motion far away, ignores how many other motions there are in between.
                        "Thus,
                        making such whole concepts poor in as much as they poorly concieve."

                        Our actions ought be constant, in that they are not winding this way or that, subject to the whims of
                        the
                        world, or our fancy. As it were, the currents of life push us one way or the other; remarking the fact
                        that
                        were bobbing, rather than diposed; whereby, be it in winds or calmness, we act defintiively.
                        <br>&emsp;I find that all actions are best when they treat you to a feeling of ripeness. This means a
                        mixture of tenderness and strenght, evenly and set, and not prone to wearniness or haste. Nor ought this
                        be
                        bridled with ambition and perversion.
                        <br>&emsp;I have noticed these feelings, and a correlation to certain actions. In the way that a certain
                        amount of exercise produces fatigue, so do ceratin actions bring delight. Or better yet, prime you to
                        experience delight, by those things, whicb by your hoisted mind, draw delight.
                        <br>&emsp;We are not like everyone else though, in terms of how we apply ourselves. And, as we linger in
                        our
                        fruition, so do the gaits of others seem imposing, or worthy of envy.
                        <br>&emsp;This is the heart of our reflections. For I generally need no assurance as to the right thing;
                        as
                        our experience bends us naturally. Rather, it is the definment, as not to wain under other's prescence,
                        which I produce, as to be sturdy in our imperfection.
                        <br>&emsp;For growth is a winding affair, and in your side steps or setbacks, so are you left vulnerable
                        to
                        the cares of others.
                        <br>&emsp;Importantly, I am alone, and this is why I see others stair. For I know none who care for such
                        delights, or live as though there are no problems. And so, if I were to have a friend, then I would
                        surely
                        be more certain, and at that, less liable to imposition in our impressionable state. "As I had others by
                        my
                        side." Nor, is our actual definition and resolve something which I can fully state. And understanding
                        with
                        others, would bring said support, but also a clearer interest ---our abscence of which invites such
                        impositions.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, I've noticed that eating well and exercising wholesomely, brings a sort of composure
                        and
                        cheer; whereby work becomes simple, your desires easily met, along with a glaze of self respect and
                        generous
                        attention; melding together to form a flow of life, whose past is not forgotten, nor the present loathed
                        over, nor the future longed for, but all mooments, as have been or are to come, blending smoothly
                        together.
                        This experience bolsters itself by actually remarking upon whats right, so that our contrast to other
                        people
                        is not merely out of interest, but propiety.

                        For some reason, my gravest aversion is to the proclomation of problems. I overt myself from this, and
                        try
                        and minimize the extent to which others hear it. A world with problems is one of conflict, possibly at
                        least.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, I don't fret over issues, but rather commentry and discourse; as these matters seldom
                        speak of the concerns in great detail, but merely exclaim them as a basis for bouts of talking. My
                        cynicism
                        does not lie in the extend of their speech, 'and that they merely wish to do so, and heard'; but instead
                        in
                        the baseness of the problems which they speak to. There is seldom notice of the many happenings of the
                        world, but instead the pointed remarks in it. None of the elements and matter which consitute things is
                        mentioend or adhered to when speaking, or proclaiming. And at heart I believe people know this. For
                        indeed,
                        hearing such discourse influences their own speaking. But merely that. For none, despite an otherwise
                        abidement to such proclomations, every decree it to me or anyone; except for their rumblings in
                        discourse.
                        It is never a mark of our life, or care rather outside of our interests in remarking upon it. I'd say
                        that
                        our abscence of happiness, in prominence, leads me to seek resolve and amends to the actual happenings
                        of
                        the world. Or, more importantly, our attention to do so. To a degree this is fine, 'for in one's idle
                        fancy,
                        ought they dream of richer glories, than novel ones'.

                        The oddest thing in the world is the discrepancy between selg-giving and peacefull acquirment. Most of
                        wisdom is aimed at the later, while some sort of sense is bent on the former. I notice sometimes I wish
                        for,
                        and feel repented towards, the sake of such former; though, in my finer strides with the latter, so are
                        the
                        concerns of the former muted.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel that, outside of wisdom, there is this self-oriented view; one of which then views all
                        things around, however wide and stetching, as united, and by that, of a certain state which you may
                        alter;
                        or are indebted to be rightfully part of. There is no surprise then, that in repentance and remorse, or
                        glory even, that such feelings are in tandum with the whole of things. "Whereby our being is in line
                        with
                        all of entirety; to which, a grieving state will see all the world as such. And, herein, lies the

                        So to great rejoice, I was able to play Civ this afternoon. Starting the game I was happily pleased,
                        though
                        awkwardly impressed upon the intitial beginning. A moment weny by and my mind was blown. There is so
                        much
                        detail in the features and improvements, and the motion of the units paired with this, makes for a rich
                        and
                        appealling experience. I can literally think of 100 cool things about it. And, notably, much of this is
                        new,
                        and not what I expected, or am familiar with compared to past civs. I have been able to get the basics
                        up
                        and going, but there are many specific things which I am not entirely sure; nor is my overall graps as
                        cultivated. Namely, there are several kinds of buildings, and multiples within that. Each sort though
                        benefits in their own kindred way. Whether base yields are important I do not know, but there is
                        literally
                        too little space nor enough population to have a fair amount of those, and all the urban improvements.
                        By
                        that, for the sake of culture, gold or science, you may focus a city down one way. That, and learning
                        which
                        buildings are which, be it happiness or gold buildings, will allow for land, unqiue buildings and
                        wonders,
                        to be seen as optimal, based on adjacency.
                        <br>&emsp;My experience thus far, is that there have been endless choices, each leading to some choice
                        difference, or a simple boost. And there is so much choice, in governments for instance. 50 turns in and
                        we've had 3 celebrations, yielding 20 for 10 turns each. I am unsure about converting to cities, but
                        almost surely, in the early game, when you only
                        have your capital, you can literally finish turns in a moment, as the load time is near instant, and you
                        only have the
                        one city producing something. The use of towns is fit to uncover, but in terms of tinkering with things,
                        it's generally
                        your main town, with little but unit movements in between. Which, on it's own end, is much smoother; as
                        researching
                        sailing unlocks embarkation, and going into and out of coast (from a non-rough tile) costs nothing.
                        Recognizing rough
                        tpyes of terrain is an advantage when exploring or trekking troops, but generally, it is pretty easy to
                        get where you
                        want relatively fast.

                        I'm sitting here then, having been tired, and near the end of the day, and having played several hours
                        to a
                        pleasing degree, and with a filled mind, I see that this experience is not one which we must work soley
                        towards, nor remark as work itself. It ought, and has never not shown to not be, simple. Being well
                        creates
                        such, as we are steady in the moment, unassailed by the future, nor lingering from the past. We
                        incorporate
                        things, with out fear or lust, and thus proceed more wholly, intigrating such fuller experience; makig
                        it
                        easier to further be.
                        <br>&emsp;But such a process is limited by ourself. Not the goods themselves, or our common deeds, but
                        our
                        paramount action. For instance, if we ate sugar indiscriminately, we literally would be so poor in our
                        activity. As we would not sleep, exercise, nor read, walk or write. Our happiness, had this been our
                        lasting
                        choice, would come from the company of otther people, be it fitting for such lifestyle, or directly
                        invovled
                        with our consumption.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the issues were facing then, is in overting ourselves from anything bad, but not doing
                        anything otherwise good. We don't eat poorly, but no exceptionally either. We don't lounge, but our
                        exercise
                        is unremarkable, nor consistent. I don't always feel like theres enough room or peace to lean into those
                        better strides; but I am also indebted to this, and getting to it; for which I don't lreiqnuish myself
                        to
                        those lower standards. "Like were haulting, rather than turning to a poor direction."
                        <br>&emsp;As an open remark, we have been hired. The process of this seems fair and managble, and not
                        likely
                        to be short of pleasantries. There's also much good to simply come from this, namely in our finances,
                        and
                        that of our stability at home. For I hold no aversion to being here, other than the remedy of being
                        somewhere I can be happy. If we are full and well, then our lower states hold almost no notice by
                        others;
                        and our fuller states were never an issue before.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I sit then, is in trying to get some motion into this right state; for which I may
                        conceive
                        and judge fairly. Our goodness is less in preperation, as if our employment was something to be fearfull
                        of.
                        Rather, in our upright stride, we somewhat exceed what the good of that employment brings, and can act
                        in
                        the right way which it's making the base for.

                        What I've noticed about 7, is how important your capital is. For it is going to be your largest city
                        early
                        on, and thus apt for urban development. Your towns may have a building or two, but since each costs
                        gold, it
                        will be limited by that; nor will the growth reach much beyond 7, wherein you specialize, or convert to
                        a
                        city; allowing for productive development.
                        <br>&emsp;The main thing, is that buildings are inlufenced by terrain or other buildings. The basillica
                        for
                        instance adds influence to monuments and amphithers. Or the temple of jupiter adds even more happiness
                        to
                        happiness buildings. Wonders to have an effect like this; the Colleseum for instance, adds happiness to
                        completed districts, called quarters.
                        <br>&emsp;Most of your developments are vying for space with rural tiles. And, generally, if production
                        can
                        be used, the value of that tile is superior, as it can hold two buildings; though this accrues higher
                        gold
                        costs.
                        <br>&emsp;As far as I know, science benefits from resources, as do the production buildings. Monuments
                        benefit from mountains, and I am unsure what gold and happiness buildings benefit from.
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing is the investment into legacy points and diplomacy. Increasing your
                        relationships
                        will increase the chance of them supporting your endevours and war efforts. You only have so much
                        though, as
                        are indepentants ripe for investment --in becoming suzerain. Legacy wise, you get more options based on
                        how
                        well you do, in settlment increase notably, but also attribute points. Completing all is no easy task,
                        but
                        you can reach early milestones. Build 2 wonders, have 6 settlments, or some mix of less with captured
                        ones
                        (which count as 2). Getting resources seems fairly simple, as you naturally do as you expand. Codexes
                        though
                        are a mystery to me, and besides unlocking some through masteries, I know not how to get many, or their
                        core
                        benefit.

                        The biggest issue in my life, is that we are not eating enough. There are indirect effects from this
                        which
                        have their result, but all from the source of our famished state.
                        <br>&emsp;The issue has always been that eating during the day is hard. If you eat breakfast, than time
                        slows, and lunch, so do you sleep. Generally I eat more in the afternoon, but particualry, we've been
                        eating
                        much less during the day, and admittedly not that much at night.
                        <br>&emsp;We've said, rightly, that our interests are in reading, writing, gaming, film and vids,
                        walking
                        and remaining upright. I also care to sleep well, sit well, work well, and stroll through life with
                        vigor.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a limit to this though, and I can only chalk it up to us not feeling free enough to
                        partake insuch interests as we please, and not otherwise contradcit ourselves. We'll notice if our rest
                        and
                        leisure time is

                        So I am struggling to bring my strategy together, partially out of expeirence, and our uncertainty of
                        things.
                        <br>&emsp;First, towns can become cities, and require no gold once this is done. They must reach pop 7,
                        and
                        costs 400 gold to make into a city. I believe the cost goes up per each city. One of the oddities of
                        this,
                        is that without a city, you cannot build a wonder. So I saw a massive desert and thought it worthwhile
                        to
                        build Petra. But I did not know if we would be able to plant the city, grow it to 7, make it a city, and
                        still have the time and production to make the Petra (as it comes in the second tier of the civics).
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing, is that independant states are quite prevalent in the world, and are either
                        hostile, and pervasive, or friendly, and apt for suzerainity. Also, based on the state type it is, when
                        destroying one you'll get 100 of that resource. Which is not unimpactfull, considering that buildings,
                        or a
                        city conversion, are a small multiple of this in total. In this way, focusing on military can allow for
                        land
                        control, some resource acquisition, and potential captures. The commander then is an odd one, as it
                        really
                        adds movement between engagments, and eventual buffs. If you mean to military early on, it seems
                        worthwile
                        to choose Discipline, and opt for a weaker pantheon. It's just hard to expand otherwise.
                        <br>&emsp;Overall, I can't tell exactly what lands are worthwhile, as their being a town seems different
                        than a city. Growth, gold and resource seem to point of such expansion, along with using gold to
                        purchase
                        buildings. "You may go to a mountain, and spend money on a monument and villa."

                        If we were wise, our actions would remark a fixed principle. For, all observation brings with it
                        respectable
                        insight. But, as if loose threads which we sew and tigthen, so is one newly loosened one not a remark of
                        those it's looped around. Indeed, an overly tight one will bear down on others.And so our reflections
                        need
                        not change based on one insight; rather, it ought contirbute the material relevant to it. Yet, like our
                        breath, so have we observed much, mildly and deeply. And so should our actions reflect this summation,
                        altering so much as it changes; but all the likely in degress, as the changes to the basis are (to a
                        degree)
                        changed.
                        <br>&emsp;The most important aspect of our life, is that we sit on the floor. We do this because we
                        experience strenght and greatness; and none of our interests feel as true and lively otherwise. As such
                        we
                        amend.
                        <br>&emsp;This requires though a fair balance of strenght, aerobics, stability, recovery and rest. One
                        invovles range of motion under stress, ie. pushups, squats and pullups, the other running and free range
                        of
                        motion, ie. skips, rotations, high knees. Stability holds us in a gentle brace, flowing through standing
                        twists and folds, shoulder flexsions, extensions and pauses, leg raises and back extension, along with
                        the
                        ripe motions of warrior and runners lunge. "There is room for our non-sagital planes of motion to be
                        addressed, as well as how we better stretch and hold our shoulders, lower back and legs." Recovery is
                        more
                        active, though it is the most accomodating, being more inclined to hold, or be more flowing. While rest
                        is a
                        mere sensibility, to wait, breathe and grow. Let yourself be, incorporate the moment or day; be it in
                        forms
                        or cleansing.
                        <br>&emsp;Key principle, is do some sort of standing when you wake up, going through a squating motion,
                        ideally do some sort of leg raise and brace, and almost neccessarily, some sort of spine flexion and
                        extension. Runners lunge is a great treat, and if your transition is viable, go through this with
                        everything
                        else. And there should be a rule that at least once, you turn yourself off, bring yourself to the
                        ground,
                        and be with form or rest, breathe and reset.

                        So the point of towns is to aid your other cities in growth, makeing specialists more useful for those
                        one's
                        benefited. You get plus 1 pop when buying warehouse buildings, and besides Augustus (who can by
                        monuments)
                        you cannot buy non warehouse buildings. The town will grow with 50<br>&emsp;
                        less food required, and can specialize at pop 7. You may delay though; and once you do specialize, the
                        town stops
                        growing, and sends it's food to cities.
                        <br>&emsp;I pair this with the notion of eventual cities, and whether a town should be created. For
                        certain wonders,
                        namely the desert ones, the advantage may be to specific to plan on doing so. The priority is the your
                        captiol, and
                        whether you wish to be militaristic, or economic. If your the first, then focus on miliatry, and
                        suzerainity. Choose
                        discipline for commanders if there are many hostile indepenandts. If your going purely economic, then
                        forgo suzerainity,
                        and engage in diplomatic ventures. Non hostile independants are quicker to convert, though cost 170
                        influence.
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, one could expect, at the very least, to grow their captial via specialized towns.
                        And so, your
                        captiol will likely have its emphasis on wonders and economic buildings, namely gold, culture, influence
                        and science.
                        Production ought be used as an investment to faciliate this, while happiness is a means to expanding
                        beyond your limits,
                        (retaining the postivity in your city), as well as supporting specialists. It would make sense, at some
                        point, to
                        consider where subsquent towns will go
                        <br>&emsp;So the general rule, is cities prioritize production, making wonders and economic
                        developments, while towns
                        prioritize food and resources, sending these to cities to aid their growth. Towns may be converted into
                        cities, but only
                        if there is high production --so it may be a usefull city--- or if it is in a far away point, which you
                        wish to act as a
                        production zone (ie. military, out at sea, for settlersand support)

                        So the basis for eating ought be in allowances. As, only being able to purchase a limited amount of
                        things,
                        directs how you select things, as to round yourself out as best you can.
                        <br>&emsp;As far as I know, we have unlimited spending. Not for dessert mind you, but for everyday
                        goods. I
                        think it's a poor, and admittedly premature, state of mind, to think that we ought spend less to save
                        more;
                        and otherwise use our parents funds, but in a respectably limtied way. We are going to save money by
                        virtue
                        of us making some, and having no expenses besides food. It also isn't worth seeing your expenditures as
                        less
                        here, than would be on our own. I don't know the balance of my spending or my parents, be it of
                        neccesities
                        or meals. But generally, I care not for an abundance of the latter; I don't need almond yogurt or PC
                        springrolls. There's value everywhere, be it for such delights or almond milk.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the things which is killing me is too little food during the day. Some organization of
                        the
                        food we have could aid this, but clarity moreso. I care not for grains, though having them is easier
                        when
                        you've waken up early. Milk and fruit seem the norm, but for whatever reason, the smoothies we used to
                        have
                        were way more filling. I think that we were succeeding at one point, by having nuts and kale, milk and
                        dried
                        fruit. Oranges are always best during the day, with tomatoes and kale early on, and carrots and nuts
                        past
                        that. Seeds seem the best fit for the tomatoes. And indeed, be it sickness, stress, obscurity or
                        dissaray,
                        not eating the kale and tomato centers our lacking. For eating is not so much about calories, but food,
                        as
                        liquids have this effect, whereby you get enough calories, but feel empty; and your body gets a little
                        hollow, particulalry in the gut, and thus chest. There's too little for your colon to feed on, lowering
                        stool bulk, satiation, and strcuture. "Making you feel like your bearing down on a smaller point, to sit
                        upright."
                        <br>&emsp;What do we need then? Well we need a balance of grains, namely in quinoa and lentils, bread
                        and
                        popcorn, along with milk, potatoes, all our roughage, and any thing of a delicate sort.
                        <br>&emsp;Milk wise we have none, and I am admittedly unsure of the pleasure in the vanilla is worth the
                        sugar. It may be, but honestly, I feel to ill to ingest a weakness. Delicacy wise, I'm not terribly up
                        for
                        frozen food, but I do admitt that our caloric intake is rather low. Though, I do feel that most of our
                        concerns come from too little eating overall, rather than pure calories. Food we can, and will eat then,
                        is
                        what I seek. Quinoa and lentils being a prime benefactor of our broader spending. Perhaps some more
                        dates,
                        of a more preferable kind. We've tons of dried cranberries, and a mostly full bag of peanuts. Kale,
                        tomoatoes, seeds, oranges and bananas are got at Langley Mart. Bread wise we've got a servining of the
                        loaf,
                        and 2 frozen E.muffins. I think that the sunharvest 12 grain is a great whole, yummy and filling food,
                        relatively cheap to.

                        can
                        say that our observations are made with a pure basis of such endevour in mind.
                        <br>&emsp;What I've noticed, in terms of worth, is that being on the ground admitts great qualitites to
                        your
                        life. So much so, that even in freedom I'd remain. But we'll discuss this later.
                        <br>&emsp;As regards the reality of doing so, I've noticed as of late that such an act (of being on the
                        ground) runs slightly contrary to eating food; nor is it as feasible without various forms of exercise.
                        That, and ignoring either of these two, while still exhibiting yourself (on the floor, and via its
                        stature)
                        tends to wear you down; resulting in our weight loss and riggedness when partaking in aerobic training.
                        <br>&emsp;Where my amends lie, is in trusting in our constancy, and worrying little of the short term
                        conseuqneces; at least the matter which is relevant to that. As I have lost weight, and our composure is
                        more tall than it is wide. Indeed there is some embarassment from this. But the real point, is that I
                        hold
                        no belief that this is due to being on the floor, or how we eat, but rather how little we exercise. This
                        has
                        come about from the year past, when we've been living a little off, or having to move and aid our
                        family.
                        <br>&emsp;I'll mention this here, but we tend to rest little when our stability is absent. And so our
                        circumstances, albeit permitting of us to live, hold little room or sway to stop. "Nor care for our
                        interests and ways for their own sake, or out of interest and delight that is, and not over bear
                        ourselves
                        to it, as if we have to proove it's worth, or validate it as important --against some otherwise
                        tradiontal
                        claim, which our abscence of makes our own something which we must embellish constantly, or be labelled
                        as
                        contradcictory."
                        <br>&emsp;I don't mean to speak of our life, beyond that is of it's effect on our choices, as pertain to
                        the
                        remarks at hand. I simply wish to reflect on what we've observed, and make for better action.
                        <br>&emsp;For the gravest problem in our life is too little eating. It's not so much calories, but too
                        little food, to sparse roughage. I feel like we do this to accomodate our exercise, but we hold to much
                        effort in leisure and craft; that we end up exercising more than we ought, and living in abudnacne, but
                        with
                        too little food.
                        <br>&emsp;I think the biggest change ought be that we hold food in the same light as we do exercise;
                        responding to it's effect, being deliberate about: as if it were something we had to hanlde, like
                        exercise,
                        or anything else which treats our condition.
                        <br>&emsp;I've never noticed that working out too little is a problem, only to inconstantly. For
                        whatever
                        reason, we work out in large chunks, but then do to our abundance of living and too little food, we
                        stop,
                        and go weeks withotu doing it to any meaningfull degree. This lowers our stretching, stability and
                        recovery.
                        Which makes the reality of sitting on the floor, and in a rather embellsihed sway of activity (for we
                        struggle with rest) a more famished experience. As we don't sit as comfortably or stabily, and thus wear
                        our
                        bodies out.
                        <br>&emsp;We ought let the long period of time which has brought us here be ironed out, and merely amend
                        to
                        do what is right; even if the effects of our past seem present. For we don't need to workout brazzenly,
                        nor
                        miss out eating because we think we have to work out. The key point, is that it may not be something you
                        wish to do; considering, that if you did eat, that you wouldn't wish to train.
                        <br>&emsp;In fact, yoga is our correction, for be it at sessions, or by your private decree, this ought
                        furnish your means of duty and living, in both constitution and remedy. Exercise ought breathe life into
                        this; and tends to do so naturally. But our choices or feeling may be elsewhere. But it is our
                        ricketyness
                        when it comes to eating and living that causes our natural means and rise to exercise, to feel bordered
                        off,
                        or of no interest.
                        <br>&emsp;Now, as for anything specific, the first learning is that eating something for breakfast is
                        essential, as your body feels hollow and bare. This ought not interfer with exercising later, but should
                        come even at it's expense. Following this, we ought eat milk, fruit, carrots, nuts, protein and dried
                        fruit,
                        cooked veggies, bananas, and eventually grains. What we should have in the evening is unclear. But I
                        believe, by the advent of breathing more oxygen form the floor, the relatively concentraed nature of
                        dried
                        fruit, and the strenght which yoga brings, that you may, sufficiently and happily, eat lighter starches
                        and
                        grains for the evening; and ingest as much as you see fitting. You need not stuff your self. Over time
                        you
                        will naturally eat more, and should incorporate doing so via yoga's advent. So you may eat, while being
                        upright. The moral being, that even if you must relax, and not write, or see yourself training tomorrow,
                        that you should still eat. "For those are new expenditures: and we must reconcile what has already
                        come."

                        My energy is low, so some positivity can strengthen us.
                        <br>&emsp;The world never fails to feel amiss when we have lost ourself. We see so little, and grind
                        against
                        the memory that's been. And others saying what is not so fine 'is said memory', bears upon me fear and
                        hatred; for I have nothing in the moment, and so brace my belief in what they say. "It is the positivty
                        of
                        the subject matter which I hold dear, and fret over when absent; but when sprung, to see negatively, I
                        hold
                        to much there already, 'that there short-sighted view twists my own, where the breadth we had is fit
                        into
                        such a shallow form: whereby the remorse in the matter, get's maligned." That is neither here nor there.
                        <br>&emsp;As we have quinoa and lentils, so would corn, tuna and a compliment of grain do me well. More
                        variety would lead to an even consumption, and more of it; as you tend not to eat when the same thing is
                        available. It is hard, but making soups is our oppertunity. As we need something caloric for the midday,
                        but
                        not too weighing. Some mix of carrots, celery, potatoes and other sorts of greens would do. Cooking kale
                        in
                        broth would seem to suffice.
                        <br>&emsp;Our training is far too absent. Were in a spot where not eating enough or living to much wares
                        us
                        down when we do it. Yet, not doing it at all narrows me, and causes our legs to awkwardly cross, and our
                        stomach to overly brace.
                        <br>&emsp;I think that watching Yoga helps us in volume; and going to classes gives us a particularly
                        rich
                        experience, and one which ripples into our own practice. At the very least, it seems fair that we'd do
                        sessions that are effective, and leave our elected time to round it out. I know that lifts, folds,
                        lunges
                        and minor amounts of core round us out, along with ground work twists and breathes. But doing them is
                        not
                        always easy, nor so effective. For we may do things to stringently, or to little, and our harder motions
                        aren't accomodated well. There just needs some consistency, and all we reboot. I've never known us to
                        flourish, or be well, when we weren't exercising, stretching or eating well. So let's do that.
                        <br>&emsp;Food is important, so get some. Iron out your stores, and establish a solid base. Sugar would
                        indeed be fine, if only a stretch of things was not already there. When were not eating so much of the
                        greatest stuff, we end up at thinner points. Considering you only eat so much, starting deeper means the
                        treats and snacks will be less bare and terrible.
                        <br>&emsp;For simplicity sake, I want you to do two things. Run as you will, and train with reservation,
                        follow a guide per day, be it stability or recovery, and eat quinoa and lentils, corn, protein and
                        grain.

                        A few reflections on civ.
                        <br>&emsp;First, the exploration age holds more bounties then you'd suspect. Religion is a gold mine,
                        with
                        it's own civics, and the means to spreading your ehtos around, and benefiting based on the angle you
                        choose
                        --and your appropriate spread. Travelling to distant lands affords Military might along with economic
                        plunder. You must reach shipbuilding though for the gains to be accrued. The use of specialists to
                        sprout a
                        massive tile is tricky, and something which I can't fully speak of. Lower in the tree, at education, you
                        get
                        an extra specialist slot per tile, so perhaps this affords us the mean. Like antiquity, Exploration ends
                        with a crisis. Considering everything get's left behind in modern, having these crisis impinge your
                        wonder
                        building for instance is a sour occurence. Also, you get plus four to settlement limit, up from the 6---
                        irrigation, miliatry training and environmentalism---- Giving you a base 8 ---as you will surely get
                        irrigation.
                        <br>&emsp;Resources are all very key, and fall into two camps. They either benefit your growth, or your
                        infastructure. Fish for instance, grow your towns, which means you can then support your cities quicker.
                        While gold allows you to purcahse buildings cheaper, allowing for quicker town growth. Public Service
                        (in
                        antiquity) and economics (to begin, in exploration) afford merchants, which, limited by the amount of
                        trade
                        relations per civ, offer you access to all sorts of resources. Economics though contradicts your
                        emphasis on
                        religion, which is itself, garnered by several civics, and a criterai for spreading --e.g, plus four
                        yields
                        for cities with wonders.
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing to elevate your play is in balancing tall versus wide. It is nice to grow your
                        capital far and wide, but if you have too few cities, then your not going to scale science or culture.
                        The
                        limit to these is generally military and wonders, plus bonuses --such as codexes and perks. For you may
                        care
                        more for exploration and economy, and use tacticts to fortify yourself. But you may also benefit from
                        more
                        cities. All in all, less you wish to go very wide, wherein city placement is key ---as going over your
                        limit
                        takes happiness away from each settlment, and thus in total based on how many you have, so you ought
                        have
                        some balance to this--- it makes basic sense that you'd have as many settlements as possible, be it as
                        your
                        normal levels provide, or anything which gives extra ---for you will have 8 in exploration, but gain 1
                        or 2
                        through the standard progression of civics and techs.
                        <br>&emsp;Another remark is your development through the age. If your yields are going to be small, then
                        worry not about the depths of the tree, and emphasise masteries and traditions. You may sacrifice
                        momentary
                        growth by having more cities, and then esatbliush more towns to reinstate the growth. "Learning the
                        balance
                        of happinss, in neccessity or for benefit ---as many buildings cost it, as if it were gold--- and gold
                        costs
                        is something you'll have to acquire, as your environment may change, or your civ. And the sense of your
                        strategy, whereby you know what is important to enrich, and what is better measured by sufficinecy."

                        The lands of civ are an odd place. There are things to do, for local or ultiamte gains. The latter I do
                        not
                        know, nor, considering the effort required, are the former of high worth. "Though, the simple things I
                        need
                        are more limiting in terms of our normal means to get them; rather than there lacking any worth at all.
                        Pairing my unfamiliarity, the size of the quest seems more daunting, and thus the reward seems too
                        small."
                        <br>&emsp;You are not penalized though for avoiding these quests, locally at least. Truly, the name of
                        the
                        game is in the breadth of your empire. Indeed, the management of it is key, 'but a well oiled machined
                        with
                        100 horse power will not compete with a rusty 500'.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, all start with 3, and get 4 from irrigation. Atop of the civics tree is a seperate
                        line,
                        ending in entertaintment; while the bottom begins with tactics and ends at miliatry training. Each gives
                        +1
                        settlement. Your own traditions unlock settlements via masteries. Notably, the center of the tree holds
                        merchants, then several great wonders at the end.
                        <br>&emsp;In exploration you get 4 extra settlements, and it is best to fill in your native lands, and
                        venture off to the sea. Treasure resources can accrue gold and economic legacy, but the locations are
                        more
                        select; and you must have shipbuilding to make the fleets. Of note, those treasure resources become
                        factory
                        resources in the modern age; so the transition is clear. But, in exploration, they don't act like cotton

                        we'll
                        figure it out.
                        <br>&emsp;Learning people's names is important, and if you can, write a note about it in your little
                        pocketbook; as it cements the learning ---so you can use said information, rather than doubt it, and ask
                        again. "For who will you ask, 'the person whose name you forgot'."
                        <br>&emsp;I also mean to learn the rules. For on the positive end, we are simply there to be, earning

                        we need, and benefiting by the acitivty and converse. As such, on the happy end, we may connect with
                        others,
                        if not orient ourselves around the work and company of others. In that, we are defined as one who cares

                        gaming, some film, older shows, youtubing, our health, and our interest in science and history. Where

                        So were going back to work, at least in a routine sense. We won't be working much, but our income and
                        stability will fasten.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of our life, there's much I wish to do. But like a problem swirving around me, my
                        natural
                        cares are distracted. For I am apprehensive due to such concern, and unable to happily be as I please;
                        or I
                        am in doubt, of my self, that my interests are born with respect to such concern; and that I ought deal
                        with
                        something rather be drawn to things, in involved as I seem to be pleased with. Writing get's effected
                        this
                        way, as our stiffer moments do keep me pointed towards it, but in a gripping way; and so I feel averse
                        to
                        it, like my interest is poorly placed. "And apparent issues tighten this sense, and thus grief at being
                        so
                        pleased." Though, it is fair to note that what fuels this fire is our actual restless state, and the
                        narrower gait in terms of such interests. "I only mean to say, as we move stiffly, that we condemn
                        ourselves
                        for seeing so: as if the point of such strides are poor." It's as if I can't remember or exhibit the
                        natural
                        care I had prior: in which our stiffer strides come from. "For none pick up a brush in haze and paint;
                        but
                        have done so before, and merely continue in said haze, but stumbly: for they've acquired the means in
                        prosperity, to be more or less formidable in dissarray."

                        more of a culmination, rather than requisite.
                        <br>&emsp;If you build two wonders you get an attribute. If you have a single library you can display
                        three
                        codices and get an attribute point. Have 7 resources, one attribute. Reach 6 settlements, or four plus
                        one
                        which is conquered, one attribute point.

                        Military requires 6 settlments. You get +2 for captured ones. At 9, you get +2 settlements for
                        exploration,
                        which is quite strong.
                        <br>&emsp;Worth noting, is that the tiers of the paths unlock options, but for each, you get points
                        which
                        can be spent on multiple attribtues.

                        <br>&emsp;So codexes are a bit easier. Library has two slots, academy has three. The academy comes at
                        mathematics, which comes directly (and without other need) from engineering; which follows the
                        wheel/bronze
                        working/currency. I believe all three are needed, then you can go straight to enginneering and
                        mathematics.
                        If you get 12 codices, there's an option to retain the academy adjacenies. The second tier gives +1
                        science
                        to all codices in exploration. Nilanada (comes at literacy, following citizenship and code of laws),
                        gives
                        +3 science, 2 codex slots, a codex, a science attribute point, plus, literacy gives a codex.
                        <br>&emsp;In total, the palace has 1 slot, library 2, plus an academy, totalling 6. I am not sure if a
                        non
                        captial city has a slot. But, more or less, you can invest in another city ---which is a good idea to
                        keep
                        science going later-- with those buildings.
                        <br>&emsp;It seems that there are only 7 on the tech tree, then 2 more with literacy and Ulanda. I'd
                        reckon
                        on a basic level, getting 6 is fine, and you can choose the +6 science for exploration or the points.
                        "The
                        attributes are a good investment for your overall build, as they give yields and other effects, and
                        powerfully so as time goes on."

                        Economics is quite powerful, as you tend to reach the starting tier naturally. Also, at 14 reousrces,
                        you
                        get +5 gold for antiquity trade route. You can produce merchants relatively quickly, and improve trade
                        relations to keep adding more. You could do 3 routes with the other 4 civs, totalling 60 gold into
                        exploration.
                        <br>&emsp;Though it is worth remarking, that be it +2 settlements, +1 science per codex, +1 culture per
                        wonder, or the trade route gold, that these cost the two points you've earned to reach them. Which does
                        not
                        always compare to two attribute points.
                        <br>&emsp;Citites have 4 slots, towns have 1. Two cities is 8, 3 towns is 3, that's 11. You can have 3
                        cities for 12, and thus 2 towns for 14, so with 5 settlements, you can near quickly convert to a city
                        and
                        slot in those resources. You need to have that many, but the slots are available. And, quite clearly,
                        you
                        use trade routes to acquire such resources --as empire one's don't count.

                        The
                        third tier of the civics tree has 3 civics that each give a +settlement, and their masteries give a
                        relic.
                        House of Wisdom is fantastic, as it gives 3 relics and slots. From piety, you go to top first civic, and
                        get
                        Hal o Keeve, which gives 3 slots, then The house is the mastery of the next top civic. El Escatol is in
                        the
                        bottom of the tree, and gives 3 slots. Otherwise, you get 1 slot in the palace, and 1 per temple. I
                        would
                        say you can get 1 of the wonders, but unless you go to them directly, their going to go quick. El Escol
                        is
                        more accessible lower in the tree, gives a settlment limit, and 4 happiness per city within 7 tiles.
                        Even
                        then, you'd need to buy 5 temples, to display 5 more.
                        <br>&emsp;I'm noticing that the legacy points are about timing; as you simply need to reach the point,
                        rather than hold it. Gathering relics is much easier, as you have qualifiers via your religion. If you
                        can
                        build a wonder, then save your gold, you can purchase the temples you need near the end of the age, and
                        get
                        your 2 points. That, or you can get +18 culture.

                        religion, or
                        4 if it is captured and follows your religion.
                        <br>&emsp;You get a potential +8 settlement limit, plus any from unique civics. You end antiquity with a
                        ninimum of 4; most civs grant +2 from unique tree, and you also get two +1 from the latter civic tree.
                        Realistically, your going to get one of those, plus irrigation, meaning a minimum of 5, and likely 1
                        from
                        the early unique tree. So 6-8. If settle 9 cities, or less one for each captured, then you can get +2
                        settlment legacy. The potential then is around 15, meaning, that you likely have 6 at home, and thus
                        another
                        6 on distant. Though, there may not be room. Navigating through diplomacy may allow this; for if you
                        ignore
                        positive relations and their upsides, you can give yourself a tolerable means to attack settlements
                        ---those
                        with resources perhaps.
                        <br>&emsp;In fact, considering that you can convert all your cities, you only need 6 settlments to
                        complete
                        the path, and 4 to get the two points ---this gives 10 production to cities, 10 gold to towns in distant
                        lands. If you conquer one city then convert, that's 4, plus 2 more settles. If you take two settlements,
                        plus settle yourself 2, thats a full twelve, and 3 attribute points.

                        So I don't understand how specialist limits are made. But, I know that Education, followd by Urban
                        Planning
                        each give +1 limit. Angkor Watt from antiquity gives a local boost.
                        <br>&emsp;They bascially 1.5x your building adjacencies. So if you have an observatory and univserity
                        between 3 resources, you'll normally get +3 to each, and plus 6 together; each specialist adds 50
                        <br>&emsp;I'm not sure how to get 40 yields, for 5 tiles mind you.
                        <br>&emsp;The bonuses are good though. +3 science per quarter at tier two (or 3 tiles). You likely have
                        3 cities with at
                        least 3 quarters each, which is 27 science. Not to bad. And you may build even more. 4 cities with 4
                        quarters is 48 science.

                        I might describe this pesky notion, so long obscure, as one of collective.
                        <br>&emsp;For one who is attending to their own efforts is no different than those who attend to a
                        country.
                        It's merely a matter of scope; or at least domain of attention. For I may focus here or there, but so do
                        I
                        only have so much. And it is quite easy to say, that people extend their view to matters beyond the
                        commnon
                        realm, into community, nations, society. And indeed, I feel this press, be it form TV or a friend. And
                        their
                        being so outward, 'or collective' as I deem it, rubs me the wrong way. As there is something natural
                        within
                        all of us, a condition; one which only dreams and fancy can paraly. "Yet against wisdom's show, and her
                        proclomation that the reality will not be as you concieve." This is why I care little, nor fret, when
                        I'm
                        occupied, as our path is formed by our dutiful efforts; and we don't even see the realm around. "Nor are
                        we
                        off to do so; as what we see from the right stops of cordial to such rightneous." Whether I should
                        attend to
                        my health, my relations, my job is one thing. But so much as I am, so is my path accordingly carved. And

                        the come and go nature of this, 'as if, be it today or tomorrow, so will I return. And all things I care

                        I like the idea of builds, be it military, or science based, or wonder based. You tend to get rewarded

                        excellig in one area, rather than being average at all. You can be smart and benefit from each side, but

                        <br>&emsp;I can't say which scenario is best in any given time, but I am able to see the choices. Do we
                        befriend or destroy city states. Prepare to fight, or collaborate with other civs. Do we care for
                        culture,
                        or the mere satiety of merchants.

                        So I had my first shift. Well, orientation. My first shift isn't till next week apparently. Though, it
                        can
                        potentially change; as I am to solidify my availability; and Dev is meant to call, or reach out; and I
                        hope
                        there is room for our request.
                        <br>&emsp;Regardless, we went in, after a relatively long walk, made the peering stride to the front
                        desk,
                        and all was easy from there. We spoke with Amber, spoke well, then met Le ne --who I called Le an.
                        Another
                        kid, Logan came in, for overnight bakery. And we sat at the desk all day, went through training videos,
                        set
                        up our accounts. All of it was pretty well, and the workday layout is solid.
                        <br>&emsp;I ran into max and Chanoya simultaneously, and spoke well again. Chanoya is nice, my age, and
                        I
                        think we've got a friend in her.
                        <br>&emsp;I am nervous about our shifts; though, I really just hope that the soul shift next week is
                        true,
                        and not to be changed. "Work tomorrow and Thursday, oh my." But I did hear great news. For one, I can
                        wear
                        any black jacekt or sweatshirt; or something dark grey. And, foremost, I can put my scooter in the
                        department. Opening the door, it's literally right there. "And the new setup is monarchal."
                        <br>&emsp;I just need to confirm. If Dev doesn't call before 6, I'll send an email, confimring our
                        availability and shift.

                        I feel a little but unerved, from our unknown itineray, and food. Coming home, we did a stretch, and all
                        we
                        needed. But when I played Civ, I just couldn't relax and get into it. I just feel like consuming right
                        now,
                        rather than playing. So we'll eat, and assuming our shift is not till next week, we'll work out, eat our
                        protein bowl, and do however else we please. Doing the videos has been great; though, some are not as
                        fitting as I'd like. It does not need to be anything in particular, but rather be made to feel great.
                        "Were
                        not missing things; but odd motions or transitions get in the way of merry goodness."
                        <br>&emsp;It is nice that we don't have to fret about going in. It is great we can scooter, as walking
                        there
                        really irks you into feeling worked. It was fine though. Sitting also wasn't an issue. For the work we
                        were
                        doing it felt rought; but eating really mended the issue. All was good, and I am really just hoping at
                        this
                        point, that our itineray can be light and known. "How funny is it, that these concerns were irrelvant
                        when
                        you were worried about meeting folk. That went off without a hitch. Let's wait for Devs call, and
                        declare
                        that of the shift we got, so are we taking that to be true. And alls good from there."
                        <br>&emsp;Theres also mind you free eye care and dental for everybody. I think 2000 for dental, and 300
                        for
                        glasses. Nice.

                        Running an empire is tough, as there is so much to benefit from, yet only so much you can do.
                        <br>&emsp;The first step is whether or not your going aggressive or not. Similar to liberty or tradition
                        in
                        Civ 5, being a conquer in 7 requires strict and deliberate action. As in all objectives, a fine choice
                        of
                        leader is welcomed. Similar to 5 though, where liberty was more particular, so aggression lies. You may
                        elect, and generally achieve it well: but the choice must be clear.
                        <br>&emsp;Then you must decide whether your going to focus on culture; as so many great wonders lie at
                        the
                        end of that road. As with many choices, choosing the attribute points to accomodate them is essential.
                        In
                        culture's case, and science also, there is an attribute point that gives the corresponding yield per
                        resource. Combining this with Hathshepsut --who gets culture per import-- directs you to code of laws,
                        in
                        order to get merchants.
                        <br>&emsp;Science has no objective claim, other than infastrucuture. But it is generally a good plan, to
                        go
                        animal husbandry and pottery into writing, irrigation for +1 settlement and masonry for monuments and
                        mine
                        production; then into currency for specialists. Bronze working may be sought otherwise; but considering
                        your
                        sim direction, this is more preventative than useful.
                        <br>&emsp;I think the most overlooked element are attribute points. Be it from wonders or mementos,
                        these
                        lead into serious build defining boons. Be it an extra settlement, means for gold or suzerainity, the
                        benefit is clear. Because of this, succeeding in the legacy path holds such potential. As the first tier
                        gives 1 point and so forth for 2 and 3.
                        <br>&emsp;For codexes, you need only need a library, and an academy for tier 2. A second city will give
                        you
                        full completion.
                        <br>&emsp;For economics, you simply need a bunch of merchants and enough cities to slot them. As with
                        most
                        paths, investing amounts to establishing the components of success, then executing on them near the end
                        of
                        an age. For instance, military requires 9 for tier two. You get 4 with irrigation, another 1 or 2 with
                        the
                        top and bottom ends of civics, and usually +1 in your unique civics. That, and besides celebrations,
                        there
                        is no harsh penalty for going overboard. For each one over you get -5 in each city, which can cut down
                        on
                        local yields. -10 though is a mere -10
                        yields. So accomodating for the lack of celebrations and policy slots means that more settlements can be
                        had. For
                        the sake of growth and infastrucutre, so it's your gain. And near the end of the age, you can convert to
                        cities in order
                        to have the resource slots. And for select one's, you can add a library, or an unique quarter. And four
                        wonders is all
                        you need for two points, and two for a basic 1. Numbers wise, 5 self made settlements and 2 captured
                        ones will give the
                        9 you need. Which means you ought reach for 6 settlment cap; bridging between the standard 4 is the goal
                        then, and
                        likely achievable with a unique civic and entertaint/military training. Adjusting your relations so that
                        at the end of
                        an age you can attack a vulnerable city and meet the requirment --a moment will do-- then raze it.
                        <br>&emsp;Regarding cities, there benefit is in adding specialists to your cities. As you only have so
                        many great rural
                        tiles; and generally benefit by urban buildings. Rural tiles allow you to either grow, which only
                        benefits you to
                        acquire more productive tiles, which is only for building. At some point, the limit of your production
                        is past the
                        demands of such buildings; they may not even be available. All you want are more yields from
                        specialists. Towns are
                        helpful then, but only as the specialists are concerned. If your culture and science is solid, and your
                        capital is at 12
                        pop, the food demand is so high that the investment to overt it is not much worth. Your better building
                        your towns,
                        turning them into cities perhaps. An important note, is that you can spexialize towns before turning
                        them into cities.
                        Besides your cap, all settlements revert to towns in exploration and modern. The amount of food you have
                        scales with
                        each, so at some point in the age, the means to grow outweighs what your tech can do. "Similar to +2
                        food to grow in 20
                        turns, versus not growing at all, but for production's sake." In this way, some towns can become cities
                        later in
                        antiquity, or earlier in exploration. You may want quarters or hard yields before beginning in a growth
                        phase. While
                        some towns are made for supporting your growth, and have no need or productive ability to develop beyond
                        that.

                        So theres two sides to our passion, namely, in generosity or reception. In one, I wish to throw myself
                        into
                        something; and as much as I seek, so do the bounds this extend; the other, I ponder over other's view of
                        me,
                        being in awe, or bearing sympathy, 'as I martyr'.
                        <br>&emsp;The point of all our studies seems, to disitinguish these yearning motions, from those which
                        are
                        less reaching, but steady, and at that forward, but through a peaceful place. The subjects remain, as I
                        may
                        see and or grip the world; but not neccessarily out of dreams and hunger, but in feeling, 'as I move

                        I wish to wake up early, hear the birds, see the sun coming into the sky. If I could do this as the
                        first
                        blue entered the night, oh delight. But at the very least, I ought come up during the morn.
                        <br>&emsp;Through the day, I want to walk, scooter, sit and read. Nor do I wish to fret because some
                        nice
                        moment is passing. The evening blue can be seen near or afar, as the setting sun. Do one then the other,
                        in
                        whichever order.
                        <br>&emsp;I want to watch Star Trek, New Girl, Easy Allies and a comforting movie review. There's even a
                        soft joy in Scooby Doo or Arthur. "The calm delight of cartoons."
                        <br>&emsp;Watching movies fairs similar, be it horror, thriller, adventure or a fav.
                        <br>&emsp;I want to play Ark and battleifled, Civ and Diablo, things like the Witcher too.
                        <br>&emsp;I want to read about the Indo Europeans, remark upon nature's simplicity, by learning about
                        the
                        baseness of heat and light. Nor do I wish to catch myself on the brambles of logic or tradition. "I
                        ought
                        only ask."
                        <br>&emsp;This is all trying of me though, in our means of sitting, breathing, exercise and nourishment.
                        Much of what we see as required of us, hold means contrary those listed. "As they are for living."
                        <br>&emsp;But one thing overcomes all, understanding. It mellows my historical view, in how fair and
                        mundane
                        it is: too, the base of our foresight.
                        <br>&emsp;For we do need money, a home, the means to food without scarcity; nor trepidation in our
                        invovlements; and perhaps, as I've learned most of all, not to be so lacking in understanding, as to let
                        ungrounded emotions pull you away from where you'd otherwise establish yourself; wherein the means for
                        friendship, satiety and contribution are made.
                        <br>&emsp;I don't believe in our fears nor apprehension. But there is a past behind us, one which has
                        ladened the imbalances of our passions against our otherwise happy memories. In fact, our current state
                        is
                        such, that our memory is so pleasantly full, that remarking upon anything but seems trivial. Yet life
                        does
                        move on, and our paces are not always on par with such serenity. "Creeping in, the outskirts of
                        tranquility:
                        where the worst seem so, as they are relatively so contrast to this side of the door."
                        <br>&emsp;I'd put it like this. There is a base, of which our heart is best defined. But due to vice and
                        wear, we loose such depth, and bound ourselves from shallower levels. The result, is that we either step
                        far
                        and yonder, 'but with vanity as our gain', or we weep and wallow, 'knowing that our heart truly does not
                        care'.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a buldging effect you see, of all which errodes our tranquility. And we know this,
                        intuitively; by our unacceptence or consent to impressions or beliefs born of 'that buldging base'.
                        That,
                        and by experience, as our bearing of such buldging leads to a relation with the world which is not so
                        based.
                        "As such buldges, in their motions, tend to puff up, as the steps from them alight. But, as we overt
                        ourselves from such strides, the buldge loosens out, and we can sink into ourselves a little. From
                        there,
                        our relation to life is more near and composite --rather than fleeing."
                        <br>&emsp;I've not the time or energy to dispell this, but the grievence in all of this is one of
                        melancholoy. And, for me at least, her retched brother: rancour. As we mentioned, our acceptence of the
                        buldge has never been so. But it is not often absent. The normal response is one, where we act on it, as
                        to
                        be alive, 'however vain'. But in our aversion to that, we tend to pitch ourselves into it. The actions
                        which
                        would be had there been no buldge there, would be like those which step from it: only from a deep and
                        dearer
                        base. "We simply let ourselves sink into that point where we'd begin; like someone who wouldn't proceed
                        with
                        a crooked home: but therein had no roof over there head." And the rains of the world bear upon me in
                        such a
                        sinking state; as she says much in media, and tradition: expressed by folks close and far around.

                        my friend. I know
                        there are two nations far away. We are fortuante in having settlments on the east and west coast, and

                        we need many to
                        hold our relics. Those are less a priority, as we can get a lay of the land, choose a reliquary, and get
                        the relices we
                        can. Having two cities focused on hard yields works great in Antiquity; we need at least another.

                        line, and potentially buy some fortified districts. Our captial is fairly protected by a two tile lane,

                        When we were young, we shy'd away from the effort required 'to grow up'. I can't say I found the ends
                        convincing, nor was my scenario in life such, that doing it anyway in our capacity; as it still felt
                        tough.
                        <br>&emsp;As this went on, and depression ensued, along with some naievety, we landed on a personal
                        scale;
                        one in which our duties turned to ourself, and for ends made of this.
                        <br>&emsp;I took this to be quite extreme, as the year or so prior, I had just simply aversed myself to
                        anything 'long term'; or when I had, I realized that my efforts were in fact not effective for so ---and
                        this brought much depression. But upon caring for myself, namely in health and study, I found much
                        strength
                        in doing so. And so I amended to do this exclusively, with no sense of anything other. Till this time,
                        my
                        relations were sparse, and my time was spent mostly alone. This had been the color of our way through
                        recent
                        years, 'but in receding, from times that reached great company, to the outskirts of a few friends'. In
                        my
                        mind, I would never go to school, marry, have children, nor be invovled in the world --as my dreams
                        confessed. All I could see was a road ahead baked in self regard: in it's gains and propiety.
                        <br>&emsp;My reverence for this did not sway, but our idea of such ends, or abscence of common ones, did
                        come to pass. And so I tried to incorporate myself into such world. I was much more confident than I'd
                        ever
                        been, but connecting with folk was tough. I'd say the only advent I showed, was that despite clinging to
                        little (in terms of the common way), I did not proceed with no other end in mind. Whereas the time prior
                        I
                        had meekly tried to 'be so invovled', but upon failing, shrunk feebly into myself, so in this case I
                        deliberately overted, and choose our personal path. It was not so fashioned as the norm, but did at
                        least
                        have some momentum to it. It held much of our personal regard as the aim, but did so while being
                        occupied
                        and with company.
                        <br>&emsp;In this, I was but confidently bored. The job I had was unremarkable, and felt quite
                        demanding.
                        Nor was our time at home lush and pleasant. Fueld by dreams, but simply admitted by our percieved
                        ability,we
                        choose to move from home. Doing so felt liberating, as we held no heat from the past and any of her
                        expecations. What we go was fun and the right to truly be.
                        <br>&emsp;Only, what this right permitted was not of anything whole and solid, but a vision, a yearning.
                        We
                        never acted on this though, and reached a similar point prior to our move; where we were more or less
                        happy
                        and stable, but missing something. And because our life was still more personally arranged than with fun
                        and
                        company, so did this basic life weigh down on me.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, our simple ways were full of self regard and activity which sprouted from it. We
                        never
                        drank, smoke only with regret, slept, exercised and ate with diligence and fortuity; and all to an end
                        in
                        which literature, entertainment and natural love blossomed. But in this state, we were unerved by
                        outside
                        responsability, namely work. And from this, mixed with adolescent confidence and rooted naievities (from
                        drugs and 'artistic illusion -of glory') I dreamt and (more or less) expected for such chains to wain.
                        Across the world I'd thought we go, or to the big city nearby. But this was never true; and our hopefull
                        wains remained by our idle side.

                        The most honest statement I can make, is that the prescence of a condition primes one for seeking
                        happiness;
                        as the weight around, however muted, still holds one in place; and thus encourages, and as much as the
                        duty
                        is right to oblige, warrants, the harvest from such amends.
                        <br>&emsp;But what if sloth's drained my mind, and through the comfort of our times, or broadly
                        speaking,

                        demand, or self regarded ones, where freshness is heralded (in freedom even), you still see the
                        continuity
                        of such ways, be it in health or reflection; and too, of death, illness, fortune and progeny: so their
                        coming place is seen."
                        <br>&emsp;I guess the fairest response, is that had your affairs caught up to something suitable, that
                        so
                        would you neccessarily be more conditioned, and by that, rightfull clear in how you oblige and benefit.
                        Even
                        if that stability was small, so would it be near and in your grasp. I contend that beyond our means for
                        living, and removing the pointed aims of our past affections, that the means for children are not
                        exhorbidant, if your wish for them is to live as well as you seek; and thus, for an end which bears
                        simplicity as a facilitator. Nor is death and illness but a lingering threat, and one, in all eveness,
                        holds
                        no remores or despair in your rightfully common state.
                        <br>&emsp;Maybe there's just not enough I'd like to do. Perhaps theres too many cloudy days, nor any
                        cemented impetus to remain healthy and pure, as to feel even the suttlest lights (of the sun and all
                        common
                        things). As it were, my younger years of self-obsession were solitary, in that those around me --similar
                        to
                        me even-- lived via a direction --regarding work, love and fun-- that remarked problems I did not have.
                        And
                        so too their desires, did they surround. Our abscence of such problems, via a mix of meakness and
                        maturity,
                        felt friction from said desires; nor was I too comfortable being aruond those who felt either afraid or
                        emboldened against issues I did not have: or even humoured.
                        <br>&emsp;Why is it though, I'd say, that writing letters is so warming, reassuring, enlivening? Does it
                        give you a foothold in the world? And one which is based on your feet? "Compared to those who are
                        steadily
                        seeped in tradition?"
                        <br>&emsp;Maybe the proper thing to submitt, is that the reason I am off, or at least the thing which
                        has me
                        posing these questions, is that of the minor duties and personal tasks, which, upon execution, would
                        give me
                        a calm and rigorous lust, that so are these hard to do; and so I look for reasons why, and at that,
                        relations with others --through writing and letters-- who feel similarly. "For none, from what I've
                        gleamed,
                        who are worth any esteem or recognition, did so based on some disicpline or quest, but rather the honest
                        submission to doing the right things; things which were relatively simple, but held increasingly little
                        room
                        to ignore or be contradicted." In all of our lives, we live amidst those without such submission: what
                        they
                        do strike at, I can not say. But there is a deliberate, if not percieved air of contrition on their
                        part: as
                        our own submission was phony, or worth contempt. That, and they hold no postive enforcement, or at that
                        pleasure --in that you'd happily share your efforts with someone, beyond the increased ability by their
                        prescence.

                        So I say, in private, but also with much solid reflection (of an empirical sort), that the needs of
                        children
                        are not fundementally different than yours; and considering what I need, so is there a small sum. And as
                        for
                        expectation and grace, of what's contemporary I will make us of and appreciate, but for traditin, or at
                        least that which is established, I will fairly rest on. "As there are taxes and roads, so are there, in
                        most
                        countries, moderate allowances for glasses and dental; plus a sufficient means for healthcare. Places
                        where
                        this is not so, are more unique than those who provide it."
                        <br>&emsp;My better times could 'be in the trenches' so to speak, with such a notion, and by that say
                        more,
                        but I have found much peace in the notion 'that people can handle themselves', be it in war, crime or
                        depravity. We hold no fear or rancour regarding illness, so why not those? Like a parent, I am ready to
                        let
                        my children go; and realize that it is me, in all our fright and garulity, 'that we picture and or
                        imagine
                        horrible things happenings; and that those suffering, do so with helpless agony and despair'. Yet, if we
                        look at ourself, and those 'whose selves' were privy too, so is the user, or subject to any experience,
                        not
                        so as your mind leads you to believe. And I compare it to being in a passenger seat of a car, and going
                        quite fast, and you have a sort of tense constriction at each halt and bump; and all the likely because
                        you
                        are not the one driving. But if you reflect on your own time driving, and thus what the driver in this
                        case
                        is in resemblence of, you know that the process of stearing and accelerating is almost effortless, and
                        worthy of no fright. "And it is by counts, a soul mark of me, that had I been in someone elses shoes, I
                        would not feel as I imagine them to be feeling."

                        Tradition is but a farther stamp of memory. For you father tells you how to live, as reflects his
                        experience. And the bare notion, is that as I have lived, so will the world remain; and as such, ought
                        you
                        live in accordance with what I've learned ---as the arean has not changed. Tradition is but a longer
                        mark of
                        people's response; in that, of the world and how she's been, so are the deepest elements continually
                        dealt
                        with. "Giving tradition her guise of wisdom: as she shows what is most important to attend to."
                        <br>&emsp;I say this, for one's condition, as come or present, is quite obvious in it's effects. One
                        hungers
                        for food and warmth; or feels stress when their offspring have to little --by what they can afford.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, it seems that all but what could happen, and has not yet been experienced by you or
                        anyone past --who may then impart it--- is all that lies as any unclear concern. For imagine a deep
                        breathe
                        and how well it calms you; and then imagine a parched breathe, in which your left wanting more. This
                        reflects a balance already in motion; and if you were in the state of the former, so would you be in
                        pains
                        abscence --or whatever the abscence of breathe would effect. It is possible that such satiety will
                        change,
                        and an even deeper breathe is required, or more. But therein lies tradition, or the past rather, telling
                        of
                        'the breathes which have been satisfying, and their aptness to change'. Literature, or study, can tell
                        one
                        of how things have been across millenia. While the words of your father can bear sense of the common
                        path of
                        a man; in that, of his breathe, so has a good one been fine; nor was there a ever a needed change. You
                        may
                        not be like him, or perhaps the enviroment currs effects. But at least on the face of it, the air here
                        is
                        more or less equal to the air there, and anywhere: and your mere ability to breathe, and perhaps well,
                        satisfies the point. "If this is not forseen to change, then one can be both filled and by that stable,
                        nor
                        with remorse at the current calm, as if it was bound to change. One's confidence during a task brings a
                        comparable cheer, in that being ordained to something brings little stress when your means to it is
                        beyond
                        capable. While someone asked to hit a target --and with an importance to do so--- sweats a little when
                        they
                        feel the loosness of their string."

                        This may be saying too much, but the most important remark of all is in the disparity between the past
                        and
                        new experience. For what is good, or to be concerned with, holds it's prevalence by a minimum degree,
                        from
                        what has so far come. Our very prescence as people suggests there was someone who gave birth to us. And,
                        as
                        such, as you worry about your friends, or the world, so do those who came before wish for you to do
                        well;
                        and by that, reference what that means, and how it is achieved (or imposed against) based on what has
                        come
                        so far for them. "It is odd then when they grow up believing something to be a certain way, then, by the
                        broadest degree, a new discovery is made; and so are we all parsed to update our amends."
                        <br>&emsp;Where my thoughts are going though, is more along the lines of acquiring new experience. For
                        if
                        one is struggling, to breathe we'll say, or to meet a certain itinerary, they tend not to notice, or be
                        eligble if they did, when it comes to new experiences: perhaps new itineraries. "I find, in principal,
                        that
                        this is why people enjoy sunsets during a vacation; as they are by definition not so occupided, and thus
                        notice it, and relish."

                        Saying what things are is a great remedy to chimeric dispair; as the impression that something is a
                        certain
                        way, but of a glaring, disorted kind, makes one grind up against it, 'as not to let the illusion in'.
                        But
                        when one here's rumour of a ghost, they pay little attention, 'as the oddity is quite clear'.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I say that twitter, for instance, is nothing more than a forum. Nor is Amazon
                        different
                        than a marketplace. In one you shop alone, whereas a literal market may see you interspersed with folk.
                        But,
                        amidst the common grounds, be it in a market or the public square, there may be spots where people
                        actually
                        mingle and discusss. Politically, there are places strictly set for this. Online forums are merely this
                        in
                        the public realm; though, the government does include itself when it announces something. By the advent
                        of
                        radio and broadband, the forum in which people engage is from any point that such waves are recieved.
                        This
                        contrasts the literal forums of governance; where the correspondance is done in physical rooms.
                        <br>&emsp;A news broadcast, or radio station, are really just channels which others can tune into. The
                        difference from online media being that in those, the activity is one of converse, 'in that you post,
                        comment or reply'; while in broadcasts, or of those who do more than interact with that which is made,
                        are
                        merely putting organized expressions onto the air. Be it for education or entertainment, profit or fun,
                        they
                        are using the waves as means of output; no different than those put out their own response. "Perhaps its
                        fair that we grant the format of this as a sort of design, as to house and parlay expressions and
                        response:
                        each though, being an upload, or use of the wave: for in the latters case, they are still outputing
                        their
                        own expression, even if it was spurred by someone elses."

                        you set yourself at a point where things with a bothersome nature appeal to you; or better said, you

                        can
                        control that: ought I merely be aware of them not doing so, but for my own benefit: as none expect, nor
                        even
                        claim ability, to notify someone of another's poor driving. "There's little communication on the road."
                        <br>&emsp;Similarly, if a rabbit hops along, or a family of racoons, there is nothing I can do, nor feel
                        responsible for, in whether they are fed, or experience the risk of traffic. I ought not shue them or
                        interfer. But, man is part of nature's garden, 'and I ought not fret if some bug gets trapped by a
                        spider'.
                        And it is quite nice to breathe in this sentiment, as it puts the emphasis on a possibility which I am
                        not,
                        to a large degree, concerned with, and rightly so. But, in doing so, the sorrow I feel is at the very
                        least
                        not one of venom and spite: as if the spiders are mean and wicked, 'seeking to blunder the interests of
                        their prey'. "Accidents are the perrils of most, in that each goes their way, looking for what nature
                        provides: but in that, albeit sometimes butting heads, generally fair no evil beyond the point they
                        collide." The injuries of those in Botswana are not, in those respects, my concern.

                        So this is not some obscure notion needing clarity, but a useful one to divulge.
                        <br>&emsp;Simply, we spend so much time balancing our accounts, making sure the income is fair, and that
                        our
                        expenditure is solide. And I am not making the point that such matters are false. Rather, I am trying to
                        say, that comparativley, we little effort (of the same sort) when it comes to the balance of our lives.
                        <br>&emsp;What this amounts to is neither here nor there. It ultimately comes down to remarking upon
                        your
                        actual duties and pleasures, cares and fears; and tailoring these as to make them smooth, as we'd want
                        with
                        our finances.
                        <br>&emsp;Where this comes to pass, is that most folk, be it in passing or close nearby, make judgements
                        about our ways: be it in finance or our lives. I find that in both, little is actually well-placed, 'as
                        if
                        one thought I was being exhorbident, when in fact a larger pot of gold would not even make a dent'.
                        Especially though is this the case in our lives. For I believe that few elements of it are accounted for
                        because we presume what they should be; nor, of the things which we grant recogition, do we also grant
                        much
                        worth of attention, 'in part because we deem it out of our control'.
                        <br>&emsp;And so, when you recieved scrutiny or encouragment regarding expenses, but with not basis in
                        how
                        your finances are --via ignorance, or innaccuracy--- that so does this occur with even more prominence
                        when
                        it comes to course and conduct of our lives: where the remarks made on grounds even less resembling to
                        how
                        we are.

                        Were drawn to things in an open way, just as we close ourselves off, in the sense that we stiffen, for
                        things were averse to.
                        <br>&emsp;But the process of action, whereby our openeness or closedness progresses, is whole in part of
                        the
                        'becoming open'. For, in a negative sense, it is not so much the consumption of sugar which derails me,
                        but
                        the progression of our body from the state it was prior, and heading, to the one it is now and heading;
                        whereby it softens, yet also stiffens. And nothing, by these counts, is good or bad, but causal of
                        effects,
                        or in other word processes.
                        <br>&emsp;Consider kinetics and a body of molecules. Adding energy will cause them to move more, and
                        further
                        bounce around. All that occured though, was that some accompanying bounces (the energy) were added,
                        causing
                        the others to also bounce (via the effect of collisions). A mere process, rather than a change.
                        <br>&emsp;This is a very literal way of viewing your actions, as you care not so much about ends, but of
                        the
                        procession which certain actions have. "Hangovers don't cause pain, but delays; as you more than likely
                        return to how you were; perhaps inclined to pause again, or proceed as if it didn't happen."
                        <br>&emsp;By this, it is fair to account for the entwined effects already upon us, be it in breathing,
                        posture, eating and stress.

                        So there are aims in Civ 7, and as regards legacy paths, wonders and skill points --along with buildings
                        and
                        tech-- I can't say I entirely know.
                        <br>&emsp;But there are strategies you can take, e.g, pairing Hatshepsut and her +1 culture per imports,
                        with Aksums early means of trade, and +2 culture and gold on trade routes. This is a fantastic approach
                        early on.
                        <br>&emsp;But then you go into the exploration era, and the direction's change. You keep the culture on
                        imports, and all of Aksums traditions, but your current civ may not have such emphasis. Better put,
                        there
                        are no civs which strictly build off your's prior, but rather offer new ways to achieve success. You may
                        maintain the element of trade, while also focusing on something else. Playing as Spain for instance,
                        allows
                        for tons of growth and dominance over sea. This can naturally pair with trade. Or you can play as Inca,
                        and
                        hold more of a tall, growth oriented playstlye; which also holds room for trade. Or, the Abbassid, who
                        actually benefit greatly from trade, while also having a hearty means for science and specialists.

                        I am in this spot, where the idea of being open, is all I've meant to exclaim.
                        <br>&emsp;Yet, there's a contrasting force, spurred in time by a mix of desire and fear: the ego, as
                        they
                        call it.
                        <br>&emsp;For in our growing years, our openess could not be fully achieved, and thus, by the load of
                        our
                        condition, we instated rewards, and depleted fears. While now, having reached a mix of stable freedom,
                        we
                        are not so drawn to such rewards, but to rather be as we abily are. "For we need no promise, or remedy
                        of
                        other's concern."
                        <br>&emsp;Fear though runs down my side, as the common frets of others act like debris from a fire,
                        'clouding our judgement, or sinjing us as it wofted over'.
                        <br>&emsp;In a weird way, we've learned so much about the world, as our illusory consumption of it felt
                        to
                        pressed upon; in that, if we wished to substantiate our freedoms, so could we not rest with the
                        perceived
                        assumptions around. That violene was how it was portrayed in film, or that the world was woddled about
                        as
                        gleamed by pithy press conferences. I felt myself ignorant of such things, and feeling like 'my innate
                        knowledge and fair experience' could not suffice, 'against the simply and world contentions of others'.
                        "I
                        was not free to be sympathetic or concerned myself." So I read memomoirs, tightened our historical lane,
                        and
                        by that, gave levity to our balanced impressions of the world. "For the root in all of this, was that I
                        could state more clearly how the world was, in regards to violence and depravity: and this gave the
                        truer
                        complexion, of red strands on a grand garmet."
                        <br>&emsp;These red stains though, only appear mild when the garmet is clear. Which is why, in our view
                        of
                        media things, 'the world appears on fire: as the garmet presented is at least 1 size too small.'
                        <br>&emsp;Thereby I stand, wondering what to do. As I see that our disturbance of such impressions, is
                        more
                        to do with the belief by others, 'in that they feel that such garmet (as viewed) is true'.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am left standing, is in the near abscence of threat, 'as their ardent view that the
                        world
                        is ending merely perturbs their ability to speak on more common matters: as simple spending and budgets
                        are
                        pillaried against the broader demise." Despite this being a little unpractical, and despairing by mere
                        sentiment, the real blurr is that, besides these edges, there is in fact nothing of concern for me. "As
                        we
                        are either positively accepted and flourishing, or are neutrally regarded, and more or less upright by
                        our
                        own means, to the same degree.There are but little embers and tuffs of negativity."
                        <br>&emsp;The question then, with, mind you, the consent to potential contraiety in needing to ask,
                        'what,
                        upon freedom, ought one do'?

                        several servings left. Kale is good, few bananas, full berries. Haven't been eating bread, but theres
                        E.muffins (frozen too). No peanuts though, and only roasted almonds. A little sunflower seeds.
                        <br>&emsp;Were making trailmix for tomorrow, grinding up kale, Cranberries, almonds/peanuts and
                        sunflower
                        seeds. Something whole for lunch, likely banana. We'll scooter somewhere, sit, and read.
                        <br>&emsp;Were working next friday, same time (9-530). I cannot recall exactly, but working out the
                        third
                        morning prior, 'so two full days and on the third day, prior to work', allows for a good rest and follow
                        through into work. We did that this week, on Wedensday, then Saturday, and I feel swell. This break is
                        longer, so we'll want to aim for a workout on Tuesday. Imagine right now, we worked on Friday, when
                        you'd
                        workout again. Probally tomorrow.
                        <br>&emsp;I would like to spend some time organizing yoga, a little cutting, if not arranging seated,
                        standing, back etc.
                        <br>&emsp;We can put our shoes on 840. Get up around 8. Not sure if I'd like to shower or not, but I
                        will
                        tonight for sure. Shoes are pretty good. We need to do some laundry though. Maybe we'll shower now,
                        clean
                        up, do laundry, then either shower tonight, tomorrow morning, or not at all. Brushing and flossing is
                        more
                        important.

                        So I met Reza today, who is the assistant to Dev. He was quite nice, a litte forward, but not in fact
                        stern.
                        I met another girl Kendra, solum and pretty, who was speaking with Reza twice; and I found it
                        interesting
                        that he was prodding her to come in on her off day, and she was laughing with him in defiance. This
                        really
                        showed how familiar they were with eachother, and how he, despite being the boss, was not in any way
                        mean,
                        or grumpy. She and I actually spoke for a moment, and had as fair a connection as one'd expect.
                        <br>&emsp;At first I met Morgan, who showed me in and where to put my scooter; he gave me a ridiculous
                        yellow coat, then left.
                        <br>&emsp;Sam was the first person I really met. She was a concierge leader, and one of those go-to
                        department workers. "A sort of funnel between all things." Another guy (long haired) named Josh came in,
                        and
                        he was seemingly her equal. He was nice, and depsite my passing remarks (while working), he was quite
                        kind
                        and amiable. She was easy to talk to, and responded to some levity regarding work.
                        <br>&emsp;To my happy surprise, Joey was still there. I only saw him for a moment, but it was great to
                        see
                        him. Alex, who I at first forgot, was also there.
                        <br>&emsp;Then I met Mozhjan, or Moji, who ran orders with me most of the day. She was from Iran, and we
                        spoke the most out of anybody. She was sweet, calmy earnest, and not dumb in her lack of english. We had
                        a
                        very pure co-worker connection, 'in that I shared a bit about my family'. She's just one of those people
                        who
                        is polite and pleased to see you, and says fairwell.
                        <br>&emsp;Kiana was a girl I had seen while shopping. "Big and Beautiful, but curvier rather than large
                        --as
                        some of the women are." She was hispanic though, or at least ethnic --by her accent. I passed her while
                        picking, introduced myself, and felt on par with her through the day. A similar thing happened with
                        Kendra.
                        What tends to happen, is that certain girls are hard to connect with, and you just don't speak with
                        them. Be
                        it nerves or interest, this just occurs. So it was nice to acquaint myself with her, as I wasn't stuck
                        in
                        this awkward abscence. "Much better to be familiar and absent." There was a girl named Swatee, who was
                        quiet, persia and somewhat pretty, but of a rustic sort. Same thing; introduced myself, 'and asked my
                        how
                        lunch was later on'. Great to be on par with everyone as such.
                        <br>&emsp;Vernon was working with Sam, and he was nice and helpful. Some guys like him can be kinda
                        duds,
                        but he for a moment showed interest in me, asking about our first day. Simple and uprigth.
                        <br>&emsp;Austin was in my view the weakest worker. He went slow, sat near the desk and checked his
                        phone.
                        Didn't seem interested in helping.
                        <br>&emsp;There was an older lady, who I blandly said hello to. She was Farenzah.
                        <br>&emsp;Then Audi came in, and he seemed quiet, but then talked with Kendra, so I thought more of him.
                        A
                        young guy named nick came in, and at first I thought him a bit high on his briches. He was sick, but was
                        more or less kind to me as we ran orders. He and Audi were young buds, and Josh too. But this was more
                        from
                        commonality, which I lacked. I asked Audi about his name, as I thought it was abi, and he was good to
                        me.
                        <br>&emsp;Started my shift at 9, having left near 12 minutes prior. Started running orders right away,
                        and
                        things were a bit slow. At 1030 I got to go for a pick, which showed our ricketyness, but also the
                        greatness
                        of picking. At 1230 we went for a break, brought our scooter merrily through the store, went home, sat
                        for
                        12 or so minutes then came back. We had lost our bag, and thus spent a few minutes before leaving, so
                        the
                        whole ordeal could have been much quicker. And it is near effortless to come back and be ready. After
                        that,
                        I had not eaten much, but the time went by relatively smooth. Not to busy, talked rather firmly with
                        Moji.
                        At 340 we went for lunch, and this is where I really noticed not being able to stretch. We do have the
                        option of taking two fifteens, potentially near 4 in this case, and at 230 prior. Depends if were
                        picking,
                        but having a quick bite of trail mix, then going for a stretch, seems to hold us up amidst our ware and
                        despondence. After our break the day seemed over, but a forever off. Then it got busy, and tiredly, we
                        worked through the hour. No one was there, so I left through the door, and have somewhat of a headache.
                        We
                        work on Friday, same time, and would like to get a workout in on Tuesday. Our cheescake hangover did not
                        help us, and the asbcence of stretching and a bungled first break, made evaerything more weary and
                        unsure.
                        Even our feeling going in was one where we did not know how to enter. Now we have a fob, can more or
                        less
                        leave our things with our scooter, or at least prepare what we want at home. We can take water with us
                        on a
                        pick, and although Devs tolerance is not understood, as Reza's is, I am with little doubt that we
                        could't
                        through a headphone on. I didn't sob without it, as the course of our day was such that it was with
                        meaning
                        itself, 'rather than some burdened means'

                        Many of my apprhensions come from our proximity to family. As their attitudes always saturate our own,
                        'while that of others tends to slide off'. Were too attached, and by that, subject to their prevalence
                        and
                        authority.
                        <br>&emsp;But this is more of circumstantial problem, rather than an enditement to our deepest way. As I
                        tend not, in our own studies, in all their wonder and breadth, to see anything as I do, when sparked by
                        ardent viewpoints, or glances at the news. It so happens that these things come up, and principially, we
                        cannot rest with these absent of mind. "For there mere prescence tugs at me." This is what I don't care
                        for,
                        but indeed it raises the question, or point rather, what ought I do.
                        <br>&emsp;For I believe somewhat, that if we weren't exposed to these things, that we'd move through the
                        world more or less positively. As only our own problems would be of concern. "And the world would not be
                        so
                        visible otherwise, as we were more content and set on things near and local."
                        <br>&emsp;Because we are at home though, and to some extent, with folk who helm themselves similarly, it
                        seems that we are endowed to properly be, 'as opposed to enjoying some of our peacefull bliss'. For I do
                        not
                        know what to do, or which feelings and aims are built on strong grounds, rather than unfit passion. My
                        reflections only suggest, and not without blood on the scalpel.
                        <br>&emsp;In other words, we may live as seems fitting, whereby the oddity of worldy joy, mixed with the
                        awkward abscence of any according regard, feels worn by the gormet astutness of the news. "As if other
                        people, in being so squished in it's shallows, sit as though they are so invovled with such matters."
                        Our
                        massive approach tends to give us much reproach, nor any natural elation at the sparks from a fire
                        across
                        the coutnry, or world. Again, this is without disturbance, as being on the softer end of this, however
                        fine
                        at heart, leaves me somewhat perturbed at the things people are watching, and otherwise resentfull of
                        their
                        apparent ardence towards it. This makes me feel like our broader view must be firmer, otherwise we are
                        to
                        accept their view, and the authority at that; or feel ignorant and or blissfully reproached from things.
                        But
                        this removes our worldy love and wonder; and in many ways, sucks all the air out of our enormuos balloon
                        ---from our studies and reflection.
                        <br>&emsp;There's this natural lift which comes from someone well read, but not so pasisonalty or
                        irritably
                        involved. Glory, relief and fame can sprout from this, in our passionate state; but so in our firmer
                        strides
                        lies those greens of openess, 'where we merely see, and with rest proceed, to the things we see; in
                        craft,
                        leisure, honor and liberty'.
                        <br>&emsp;Yet, without the preface of this ending with the flairs bade by passion, it is not clear how
                        we
                        will ever be anything at all. And this ends up making the world feel either far, dangerous and chaotic,
                        or
                        as we truly see, but in need of definement. "This is itself a sort of bare passion, as if we need to
                        assert
                        the path were on."
                        <br>&emsp;Ultimatley I do not know what to do. For, with some vice, we deem the world well; and of its
                        parts
                        which are not, our view of such does not resemble the actual bits and pieces of such portion; nor is it
                        ultimately my concern. "I cannot stop the warlords of Africa, nor those stricken by aids." Where I
                        somber
                        then, is that this natural gait, in which the pithy troubles of modern life are not pouted over, and I
                        distance myself from ignoring the real troubles, while admitting our vast inability in terms of them, so
                        does our relatively free and privalged place within such comparison, leave with it (from some passion) a
                        view and claim, which is somehwhat genersous, but otherwise dear and pleasing. "I believe this is but
                        our
                        own point down the common lane."
                        <br>&emsp;But here lies the conflict. That such a view, where the good was what I plainly recieved, is
                        in
                        fact not so just; as, we don't genuinely have it, 'for it does not lead to anything beyond ourselves, as
                        being truly free would, as you'd be open.
                        <br>&emsp;In total, I have no remorse for our guilt, but rather an isolated despair, at the pungent
                        critiques of the world, 'as if it were truly that way, or at least encapsulated by said critiques'. For
                        when
                        I am open, it is in the world, and as such, my relevant contribution to it in whole, is proportionate in
                        time as the effect is aimed in weight. But if I am not so open, or at least impressed by the critiques I
                        see, that far off lane, 'in which our life is arranged to the world', does not hold its clarity, 'but
                        instead get's swarmed with those saturated views'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt that our energy is to low to inquire and mend, the core trouble in my life: which
                        is,
                        the thin protests against the world, 'and the restless fear and contempt for it, plus the hollow
                        judgements
                        born from its critique', bring reasonable doubt, but also a solitary aversion, 'as if I didn't have to
                        energy to be even somewhat better than them, as even that felt some poor', that I am curbed to a private
                        progress, 'in which our doubts are ironed out, and our flatness becomes a memory, amidst a cheerful and
                        sensible constance'.

                        Ancient wise, Hanging garens is the first solid wonder. It gives an expansionist point, which combined
                        with
                        a memento, can give you growth to cities, or food on your warehouses. That, and if you get another
                        point, be it fron events or military legacy,
                        you can get extra pop in towns, or refund growth from specialists. This takes time to come online
                        though; and if I knew
                        that I'd only get the third point by exploration, then my choice would be less clear. You can play As
                        Ibnatta, and
                        automatically get the growth; withtou the Gardens even, and then, upon doing so, get the third perk. The
                        requirments are
                        simple, next to a river, and good for adj.
                        <br>&emsp;Gate of All Nations is a must, as it is not often contended, relatively cheap when you buy,
                        and essentially
                        gives you +2 strenght in all wars. Combining this with the first point in Military, gives +3.
                        <br>&emsp;Petra is solid for desert and not much else. Pyramids require nav.river and desert, but do
                        upgrade all rivers
                        pretty well.
                        <br>&emsp;Emille Bell is almost never built, and is quite excellent; especially with Ben Franklin. It
                        acts as farmers
                        market but for your captial. Maybe the value is low relative to what you need once you get it in
                        mid-antiquity, but
                        still. Must be built on rough terrain though. The diplo point is solid, as you should aim to get the 25
                        off endevours. It is the 2nd one mind you, so paired with a memento, and your diplomatic yields come
                        much easier.
                        <br>&emsp;I'm not into happiness, as I tend not to go over settlement limit. My understanding is that
                        the penalty is
                        more of a local one; as the broader neagtion to celebrations is unimportant: as you generally have
                        enough policy slots:
                        many of which use novel policies.
                        <br>&emsp;Weiyang palace is fantastic but often conteseted. Requires grassland.
                        <br>&emsp;Pyramid of the Sun is solid, giving culture per quarter. But comes late in the tech tree.
                        <br>&emsp;HaMongi gives food and culture to fishing boats, so good for coastal starts.
                        <br>&emsp;Colossus and Monks mound give resource capacity, which is novel.
                        <br>&emsp;Angkor Wat allows an extra specialist in your capital, which is fantastic. The colossus and
                        monks mound are
                        more contested than this, but it does eventually go. The Khmer get it early though.
                        <br>&emsp;So, in antiquity, besides the terrain wonders, you've got Emille Bell for captial food,

                        Angkor for specialists, Colossus for resource capacity, Hanging Gardens for expansioist point and some
                        growth, gate of

                        arms is perhaps not essential.
                        Theres a spot for Colossus north of us.
                        <br>&emsp;I see a Hawilt center next to our capital, with room for 4 surrounding it. Colouss will touch
                        two. We could
                        remove 1 Hawilt for a solid urban tile (adj. to coast), but there is another one south of us. Though the
                        difference is 3
                        compared to 6.
                        <br>&emsp;So we'll put the Pyramids south, where we'd otherwise put the food. It's a good adj.
                        <br>&emsp;The Madrasa gets adj. from quarters and science buildings, so having this next to our villa
                        quarter and
                        science quarter would do well. The mosque gives adj. for happiness buildins, and gives culture and
                        happiness for
                        wonders. So if petra and pyramids are attached to this quarter, the adjacency will be large. I am also
                        keen to make the
                        Tomb of Askia, which need only be on desert. Petra is also not essential, but a solid benefit.

                        <br>&emsp;Not too much here. Askia is essential if you have a desert tile, and Notre Dame is awsome. It
                        is
                        in the top end of the tree, so going to it directly is important.

                        So just a little bit of a brainstorm, but were settled on a long nav. river, with a upper spli, and
                        minor
                        river to the side. There's several rough tiles nearby, a silver, a wine, a dyes far off, and two gypsum
                        tiles right outside my door.
                        <br>&emsp;I reckon were on the north end of the world, so I ought plana south west and east expand, and
                        one
                        directly south, and a city in between. The nav river and wine will give me some happiness, so I can
                        hopefully go 1 overboard. 4 settles that is.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of layout, the gypsum are on the opposite side of the nav. river. And, to be clear,
                        the
                        fork beside it is a minor one, but still one no less. This is a perfect pyramids, and thus step to
                        masonry.
                        A brickyar would do great, and, keeping it simply, a granary would fit beside it --for warhouses.

                        So I had a really solid game, but kinda got burdened by wonders. Their great, but not even incredibly
                        so. A
                        single Pyramids would have added 5 or 6 production, which wasn't even anything we needed. We could get
                        that
                        from a barracks.
                        <br>&emsp;Remarking upon the early wonders is nice, but unessential. Its better to remember that late
                        game
                        wonders are what we need.
                        <br>&emsp;We ought look for a culture spot, a Ulema spot, and a science spot.
                        <br>&emsp;The Hawilt gives adjency to monument and altar, meaning terribly high specialist count.
                        Perhaps in
                        just antiquity though. But still, we can boost it nicely.
                        <br>&emsp;I just feel like worrying about the things you have which could be oppertune, and not what
                        clear
                        oppertunities you have, is a problem. As you only have so much time and effort; and military is
                        required,
                        along with time to set up trade routes. The production will come, and not in a requisite way from
                        wonders:
                        we have enough if we can build them. For, we need to clear barbs, fortify our cities, get our civics up
                        and
                        progress. Five production from pyramids and petra is too little for the investment, and worry. If the
                        start
                        demands it, sure. But rememebr, navigable rivers are only for fishing boats, and our build cares too
                        little
                        for them. We want woodcutters and sawpits, or brickyards and mines. Growth will come, but is only needed
                        to
                        get key resources and our production going.

                        So we settled on the east coast, more or less above the equator. We've got a strong capital and nearby
                        city,
                        each with several wonders and quarters. A bit north lies a small town, aimed at feeding my capital and
                        adding camels.
                        <br>&emsp;Further south lies two prominent settles, and one recent one. The farthest one is made to
                        access
                        trade routes with Napolean and Hoze, while our nearer one holds gold, silver and two cotton.
                        <br>&emsp;Since we are playing as Abbassid, our aim is to build high adjacency Ulem. It gets benefits
                        from
                        adjacent science buildings, quarters, along with culture and happiness buildings, and wonders of course.
                        We've got Angkor Wat, plus an available specialist growth perk (from our military expansionist point). I
                        believe we have three gold, culture, two science and at least 1 wildcard slot. My aim with economics is
                        to
                        give towns an extra capacity, so they grow..
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of settling, I am keen to reach the islands at sea. At least 3 settlements will do,
                        and
                        relatively close. Having room to build out, and potentialy reach the far lands is oppertune for our
                        trades,
                        but seeing as the sea will fill with other's settlements, the amount of trade will be high --- our
                        mainland
                        will be near full accessible.
                        <br>&emsp;Because of this, I want our current 2nd city to become a city as soon as possible, as it is
                        aimed
                        at the Ulem and its great person. "I don't want my capital having to worry about building that."
                        Similarly,
                        I'd like a third city on the mainland, so that I can build merchants and military if need be. Some salt
                        would serve us nice here.
                        <br>&emsp;Regarding Abassid, you get gold for placing specialists, production based on Urban pop, and
                        science based on trade income. We are going to loose our routes, but getting them up while our initial
                        settlers travel off will do. I'd also put the +1 science on slotted resources --as we have for culture.
                        <br>&emsp;Wonder wise, Tomb of Askia in 2nd city is crucial. I feel pretty confident in our ability to
                        make
                        relics later in the age. We could invest in wonders with slots, as to avoid the amount of needed
                        temples,
                        but so aren't I worried. Distant Land settles, in one final sweep, will be converted --- which I
                        believe,
                        like foreign settlements, comes online truly upon the final theology tech. Treasure Fleet wise, I see
                        little
                        promise, as the reward is too small. I am going to keep principle, and choose a foreign empire that is
                        strong, rather than awkwardly angled for the sake of treasure fleats. Hopefully we may get 1 or 2 of the
                        points, but I'm not fretting over it. And science ought be easy.

                        I'd say very confidently that things are well. Swell even. But I will admitt that I am a bit off. In
                        less
                        acceptable ways, our yoga has been short, and thus our recovery from the stress and work prior has left
                        me
                        doing too little, and thus a little bare. I am not sure how to return to a more ample state; but I do
                        see,
                        that despite the obvious effect from not working out, 'that it was from the thinning trunk that such
                        abscence occured, and so ought we restablish that'.
                        <br>&emsp;Most of our yoga is there, in guidance, be on the floor, standing, quick or long. I do need
                        something that will bring us into downward dog and lunge, even boat or squat. But the road is clear
                        here,
                        'and we were simply too cluttered before, in order to partake in the jumble of vids'.
                        <br>&emsp;Eating wise were good, and will surely return to more wholesome foods upon our activity
                        increasing.

                        like
                        a long rope, so does it's natural give cause it to dip in the middle. There are many aspects to this,
                        namely
                        in our positive address of the world and the use of modelling, 'as to simply say, on such basis, be it

                        gather some accompanying ligments of measuremt devices and thermodynamics. And I see overall, how being
                        open
                        is really all I seek, and is in fact all I'm good to do. "For there is an irony in wishing for
                        something,
                        'even if it is of some grand plan born from your private ways', when such ways are in fact procurred and
                        developed by our flourishing means to readily and rightly do them: wherein the care and nerve for such
                        plan
                        is bare. That, and you naturally see far off, and by your grated stride, reach it. Which is to say, we

                        There is a positive response to everything. Doubts of this, suggest something neccessary, 'for how did
                        such
                        motions begin'. And indeed our inquiry lay.
                        <br>&emsp;But I'd like to describe things, or remark upon them as objects we normally see. Here lay
                        identity.
                        <br>&emsp;For I think of our heart and it's beating, our mind and it's way. And I think about the
                        reflections we have, or images, and how they sometimes frigthen us; and how this seems positive, in
                        that, of
                        your response, so is it to what appears to be there.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, as a sort of form to this principle, is that a brain, in all it's working
                        conduct, operates as seems natural; in that, if it creates images, that so would we remark upon them as
                        so.
                        But, as to render off the doubt of how we know, we merely say that so is our brain, or a complex amidst
                        that
                        which creates the sensation, is similarly real, and by that, also responding. "Our idea of self and its
                        orbiting ways, need not rely on some seperate motion; but incorporate it with the rest, as we do organs
                        and
                        tissues." For in that, our doubt is properly laid.

                        Looking at some of our concenrs, they tend to fall on the range of foods we eat. For I am abvoe
                        mentioning
                        our choice not to each ice cream or chocolate. But, as regards granola for instance, so is this not some
                        blatant averson. I decide no, but as such, 'rather than it being outside the question'.
                        <br>&emsp;Where the question lies, is in the grazing foods of bread, bags and or fried food. Dumplings
                        have
                        been nice, despite there time requirments. Bread has always been nice, but is not generally exciting.
                        Going
                        for naan has shown otherwise, but does cost a fair bit --with each piece being 2-3$. I'm unclear though
                        which of the three resterautns require a minimum amount; as I like to go, and getting 1 piece would be
                        enough. There is the whole-grain loaf at superstore, but this is not terribly special. "Something you
                        may
                        bring home from work, but not go back to get." Popcorn remains satisfying, as do potoates and
                        hashbrowns;
                        though these latter seem a little thin. A recent advent is yogurt. Similar to bringing home oat milk,
                        you
                        may go pack for 4 mini yogurts, or a solid tub. The latter is a bit expensvive, while the former are
                        less
                        than 4$ on sale. And they are fairly wholesome. Chips have never been an issue as we get the all-natural
                        ones. But there are an avocado made variety which is somewhat acceptable. A true moderate treat, 'that
                        djon
                        honey'. And I did see some good looking lentil, bean and rice pre-mades in the international section. "A
                        bit
                        more full and hearty than Old Ben." And besides this, are packs of spring rolls, be it the red ones, or
                        the
                        better value at Fresh Co; which also has banana chips. Similar to granola, I choose not to have corn
                        nuts,
                        though perhaps a fairer variety can be known. That, and seaweed is a great munchy, with little cost.
                        <br>&emsp;As regards training, I feel the need to do some, and let my body take it. I think our use of
                        yoga
                        ought recover us after work, and thus bring more training afterwrods. "This time, we did not reach that
                        point, and shed off much of our gains." Similar to free range, where it's about reaching a point of
                        exertion, training requires comparable bouts of squats, pushups and pullups, and some mix of running. I
                        think for our purposes, we ought let running be rinse, rather than a core part of the circuit.
                        <br>&emsp;Treat each exercise as seems fit. Squats are about patience, as you could relastically do a
                        100.
                        Drop, then pause, then drop again. Do this twice. For pushups, drop, pause, be it stabily in plank, on
                        the
                        ground, on your knees, in forward fold, or downward dog, then drop again, and do this twice --returning
                        to
                        standing in between. Chin Ups are hard, and perhaps we might simply train at home, then go scooter to
                        P.athletic to run. But I say this because our garage bar is solid for easier training. Using the
                        parallel
                        bars at Eagle park will do though. And I would say, that keep yourself going, but with fair rest. My
                        hesitance is in whether you can do more than one set, and if it's not better to just do multiple bouts
                        in
                        one contain sequence, pausing for longer in between. We'll see.

                        So our judgement get's thrown against the cliffs of our ego. As such is a cementing of what we know; and
                        thus, contrary views fit little.
                        <br>&emsp;The soruce of this cementing is fear, or desire. The source of these is generally your
                        parents,
                        common fears and the toil of labor.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is that the world is full of discourse. Generally, all are seperate in their
                        little groups, and thus speak in terms of such group. "Everyone is who is part of that group." I have no
                        problem with this. But, in our less than open state, we are perturbed by judgements which reflect the
                        fact
                        that there are other groups out there.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the great perrils of this, is in fairness or pretensionous, the words of other's run up
                        against our ego. This is so, for what they say may burden our clinging belief. And the response is so
                        critical, as we either deny, or ignore out of invalidation (of their part, as we deem). But there are
                        also
                        melancholic responses, whereby you don't assert or digress the viewpoint, but let it stand. Indeed, our
                        ego,
                        or sensibility, ought not be so rigged as to not accept other points, 'and let them come in and slide
                        out'.
                        We've experienced this, in ease and positivity. But despite our reproach to others, or allowance, so may
                        we
                        not be so light and ample, and by that, 'sure in our own righteous way: whereby were fine to hear and
                        accept'. Instead, our memory of this may serve us the proper response, but our state may be so as to not
                        be
                        but consumed by such point. Anger and resentment builds, as you feel your beliefs being torn at, and you
                        wish to affirm otherwise. But your past pleasure, or strenght, lets you sit with it, albeit in a sunken
                        state. "And indeed, the familiarity of this, or view of it, is such, that when this oppression is but
                        minor
                        and poking, you feel so unsure of whether it will ever go: as something so mild has no right to be
                        deemed
                        uncommon, while something terrible may be seen as a novel moment." I fear this melencholoy will not go,
                        'and
                        the root of that sulleness, is that when your core is so fine, and you affirm not, there is a ember of
                        truth
                        to the point given. As your flatter state, albeit willing to take in, holds no settled matter --for
                        which
                        our past time gives means to let in at all. But without it's own color and flair, as to happily take in
                        and
                        otherwise proceed, it seems like what's coming in as what there is at all'. Indeed, the cause of
                        affirmation
                        is clear then, in that, of what's coming in, we disagree. And so it feels all too painfull when such
                        impression is more or less consented to, 'as you fully take in, but have nothing that naturally witholds
                        it
                        from becoming the truth: as the bones of what you settled on prior, is flat'.

                        So I see that most concerns come down to judgement. As this proclaims some sort of meaning. And to be
                        clear,
                        saying something is good or bad, is a judgement that effects of a favorable or non favorable sort are
                        going
                        to happen. "Do this, it's good for you: you'll like the results."
                        <br>&emsp;I have noticed, at least I can clearly say, that of the subject in question, that I am not
                        always
                        on board to heed to such judgement. For, like Descrates, I don't think anyone judges better than
                        another,
                        but rather, what we use in our judgements, in terms of the matter of the subject. For, if someone says
                        that
                        their evaluating whether a meal is good or terrible, I'd say their consideration of whether it is so
                        horrible reflects deeper pretenses, of perhaps expectation, justificication. Or, better said, someone
                        may
                        simply say that the food is poor because of the way that a waiter spoke to them prior. Which is, in
                        point,
                        nothing to do with the food; but also not something which tries to convey the meaning of the food, and
                        thus
                        what is relevant to me. "Only the service is concerned with such matters." And even if we spoke of the
                        resteraunt as a whole, and someone was so heavily agasint it due to that experience with the waiter,
                        that so
                        might their judgement of all its parts be immoderate, 'do to the heavy weight of that one poor aspect'.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, be it on reddit, in conversation, or on tv, you can see the hilt in which people's
                        judgement rests.
                        <br>&emsp;The point is not so much about motive, as if they have some agenda. And, thus, we are not
                        struck
                        by any suspcion of there being so. Rather, when we suspect that the material which their judgements are
                        formed of, is dissproporiante, or at least absent when it comes to relevant things, then we see the
                        judgement as somewhat small and hollow. "Indeed, and I submitt this with full acceptance of our ego
                        being
                        tainted, and thus, with care to bring this to submission, but when it comes to the judgements which
                        overt
                        me, 'at least, those which spark my eye as being hollow', it is those which have this shiny appeal, be
                        it of
                        authority, rhetoric, tradition, even expertise, but that the mold of the judgement, in all its candor
                        and
                        hue, seems based in response to the fact that other people are also judging, and that by this one of our
                        own, so is it so, in importance, simply because others are also stated."
                        <br>&emsp;I think a solid case in point, is when the actual meaning of what people say, in that their
                        was
                        some true consequence, they bring up points like, 'our democracy, and the government', which ends up
                        being a
                        bold way of saying the least about the whole. And where my arrogance lies, is in the grafted confidence
                        that
                        our sensibility brings, but seems halted by some esteemed prediction that countries are going to war,
                        were
                        loosing our license and liberty, that crime will pluck our eyes out. The issue, is that these are all
                        objects dripping from some high ideology. Rather than remarking the reality of pipework, be it in the
                        fabric
                        of laws and jurisdiction, or literal water words and service, it remarks more about ideas. "And in many
                        ways, my attribution of vice to the predictions which come from this, come about because we think that
                        world
                        ought be better regarded." This holds our key though, for in that sense, when it is not in memory but a
                        current openness, then we are not so rot to defend it, and by that, tear down the words of others, who
                        speak
                        beyond such basis.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, our happiness is right, but not in our conduct. If it were, we would not have to pull
                        down
                        others, but rather exhibit our own words from such basis. "I know not though, what we should do when we
                        are
                        not so boutfull; and whether or not it is truly bad to hear others. Some admittance is fair, as in rest,
                        so
                        in idlenes can you enjoy and listen. But so, in the nature of your stillness, in its friction and gruff,
                        and
                        all the passion and affirmation to boot, ought you be cautious, as not to see, and from there respond,
                        to
                        others words. I know this is sound, for it speaks not even of their basis: as your own abscence makes
                        you
                        wish to hear nothing, poor as is likely, but even of that which is solid."

                        <br>&emsp;There is much which I'd enjoy, if not for our worked state. I am glad we did so, and likely
                        we'll
                        prep up from here. But things need to require less from me at the moment. God of War, Civ, New Girl,
                        Allies
                        even, sit here as great things ready to happen. I feel restless with writing and reading. And I don't
                        wish
                        to cower over think pieces or op eds. Porn will do, though I can't think of any wortwhile venture
                        tonight. A
                        scooter ride for sure, but the food we have is what we get. We'll go tomorrow. Looking for more yoga
                        vids
                        could be nice, and if we have the energy, a science victory is in our grasp, and the early parts of
                        Svartleheim. For Allies, there are alot of background vids, to accompany civ. But going into August,
                        with
                        Red Dead and the Direct, I'd be cautious. And as regards our time moving forward, Star Wars sits when
                        and if
                        you want it; as is Star Trek resting for our scrumptious time.

                        I'll say, for the sake of definition, that all things amount to, innately, what they are, but through
                        that,
                        amount to nothing more than a form, a property, be it in numbers or width, and as such, exhibit
                        themselves
                        with such properties, as the thing they distinctly are. "As a group and person are both things,
                        differing
                        merely in properties."
                        <br>&emsp;There is nothing in the world which does not fall down this line. Seeing as the world is full
                        of
                        things, it is clear, that all things weave amongst eachother; but almost neccesarily miss many. A knot
                        here
                        may cause tension on a string far out, but so is this an indirect effect, and the actual relation in
                        that
                        string far out, is of the cause it recieves; which, however sprung, is not by those who pushed, but of
                        the
                        end of their action which they recieved. And ought our judgement, in being concerned with action, care
                        only
                        about that: less we are going to do something about those who we'd explain as initiating such cause.
                        Just as
                        one's parents are not the cause of their offrsprings crimes, so is a crime in Florida not to be blamed
                        for
                        the effect it has on the economy in that state, and how such state interacts with your own. How your
                        state
                        receives effects from Florida can be explained by one of it's crimes, but it is the effect which said
                        crime
                        procurres in Florida, and then exhibits itself in the relation between Florida and our state, that we
                        can
                        properly say, as regards us, is the cause. "For even if one is stressed about what someone said, and in
                        their lapse of attention hit someone with their car, so the story goes, but their place as the driver is
                        judged no less."

                        Something we ought admitt, besides our ability to deal with something bad, and by natural extension of
                        that,
                        other's ability, is that something bad may in fact happen.
                        <br>&emsp;And like many things, the judgement we offer is only sound, when the scenario at hand is
                        properly
                        stated; but also the value's in question.
                        <br>&emsp;For the ultimate plea of someone in trouble is so, that of the force invovled, ought we defeat
                        it.
                        But of their actual experience, ought we not forget who they are as one subject to such force. By this,
                        ought we remark fairly upon our fears, and whether they are of ourselves, or in sympathy; and if the
                        latter,
                        to which extent? "For we don't simply mean all those who are far off; as many are more ore less fine as
                        we,
                        in their own comparable locale."
                        <br>&emsp;And so it is far beneath the abilities of man to esteem and or proclaim a shadowed view of
                        something, 'whereby nothing but a point is addressed, while all else is caked in shadow'. And it is
                        another,
                        that, within reason, that our place and other's is not also pointedly met, but as broad and complex as
                        the
                        situation at hand. "There is indeed a moment where the blade enters one's heart, but ought our sympathy
                        not
                        extend to the trepidation prior, and labor in reaching that." And as one's whose fears are more than
                        likely
                        in sympathy, ought we not be so clouded, or drug rather, in such discomfort, 'pointedly'.

                        So we finished Aksum, 'winning with flying colors'.
                        <br>&emsp;It is time now that we up the anti, and face the gods.
                        <br>&emsp;Doing so though, beyond the managerial competition, is the matter of combat. As said Gods are
                        much
                        harder than even the heartiest of our earthen lot. And by that, beyond our reach for yields, ought we
                        also
                        prepare ourselves to defend. Offense is possible, but nearly demands a tailored course. While even the
                        faintest of attemps can be taken, if you respect the potential risk and cause of conflict.
                        <br>&emsp;At the root of it, +1 support from the first militaristic tree. It has been noted to me that
                        you
                        can change mementos each age, and so, regarding expansionist, which has the least access, so can you
                        choose
                        this freely for the first age, and then select not for exploration. Military legacies are generally the
                        hardest to achieve, 'though two can be found'. And you do get a wildcard each age. Plus, hanging gardens
                        offers an expansionist, and I generally wish to reach the third tier, 'if my aim is specialists'.
                        <br>&emsp;One important element, is commanders, and their mix of defensive and offensive abilities.
                        Usually,
                        it is quite accesible for you to get 1 merrit badge. There may also be merrit in having 2 commanders, as
                        this can add more width to your defense, and variation, 'be it for healing or further offense'.
                        Otherwise,
                        in the tech masteries there lies combat increases for all classes of units. And it would not be foolish
                        to
                        consider the route of an invasion, and to add some defenses with that in mind; and thus, also invest in
                        boosts to such fortifications.
                        <br>&emsp;Gate of All Nations is a clear and direct boost to your combat, 'adding 2 support in all
                        wars'.
                        "This essentially halves the brevity of the gods". It is somewhat competative, but is not in need of a
                        mad
                        rush. Hanging Gardens is similar, and they tend to be available around the same time.
                        <br>&emsp;Besides Dur Sharoken and Red Gate, there appears to be no other wonders which assist in war.
                        Nor
                        does the military tree offer much more than the +1 support. Civ bonuses are the distinct factor, along
                        with
                        tile placement and commander effects. One benefit beyond antiquity is the naval commander, as they can
                        quickly accumulate merrit badges, 'as the trees are shorter'. It would not be ill-advised to form an
                        early
                        navy and assault independants around the world's coasts. Similarly, once Modern hits, set up aerodromes
                        in
                        all corners of your empire, as to cover various points of attack. Water combat is generally costly, and
                        thus
                        requires flanking and commander support. But airplanes can attack unscathed, and thus soften targets
                        prior
                        to your own ships attacking.

                        If I could, I'd like to be forthcoming. First is porn. I've noticed myself a little overt, or
                        susceptible
                        rather, to the pleas and thoughts of others; and I can't help but think our muddle relationshiup with
                        porn
                        is a contributing factor. I held this view for some time, and it's not till of late that I've been less
                        reserved in using it. Mostly, because I find it rewarding. But not so much in the wholeness of it's
                        good,
                        but as a sort of activity or distraction, 'akin to going to get food'. I don't feel our suspicion is far
                        off; but I therein seek a better means of masterbating; as such an affair I find a fair delight. For
                        one,
                        our means to arouse ourself, albeit easier by the prescence of people, is one that can be alleviated by
                        accessories: namely our hanlder. The smell of it is no clear issue, but rather the hiding of it, as to
                        be
                        private. Right now it is hidden, and has been since I got it. But, due to our proximity to other's, we
                        are
                        more inclined to use it when no one is home, 'as it is hard to wash otherwise, without getting cum on
                        the
                        bath floor'. We may deal with that in it's own right, or use it indiscretely when no one is home; as we
                        can
                        more reasonably wash it afterwards. But the main thing is, to have it hidden, nor exposed, but able to
                        be
                        accessed, in the rings, the lube and the handle. We can make this happen when none are at home, and
                        hopefully permitt our use of it, as to suffice the poorer side of our want.
                        <br>&emsp;As for leisure, we are finishing New Girl, really just watching it and skipping through. I am
                        somewhat overt to Civ commentaries, 'as they fall in line with most'. Guides and or calm playthroughs
                        are
                        welcome, 'but this is more in line with Pacther and Bardown', rather than allies.
                        <br>&emsp;God Of War is great, and I'm really getting into Ragnorak. Civ is wonderful, and I will soon
                        mention our plans for the game next.
                        <br>&emsp;Food wise, I've shied away from Naan, as I see it less fitting for our work to come. When that
                        is
                        over we'll be free. We've worked out, and unlike recent memory, our neck is not sore. I am sensing a bit
                        of
                        exhaustion, in terms of choice, but having yoga to do, for guidance' sake, has caused this finer result,
                        and
                        treated me well in general. I can see how it comes though while were active, and how it leaves when that
                        is
                        gone. I even see how, upon work, without a grundge forward to train, we may not do yoga either. And I
                        think
                        the truth, is that your bodies roots need cleansing first, in groundwork namely. Standing is fine, as
                        are
                        lunges and downward dog. But being clear, as we were not last week, is the core good: and we've done
                        quite
                        well in organizing an allotment of sweet and healthy selections.
                        <br>&emsp;I can't quite think of anything regarding good, if only to keep away from carb thinners; as I
                        feel
                        with hashbrowns and bread right now. I feel more keen on sugar, but mixed of something whole, like
                        yogurt. I
                        can't think of anything else though.

                        otherwise
                        remove, and the Elephant, which is surely a Barbarian killer of Godly defense.

                        soul
                        improvement and thus one which you can readily invest in.
                        <br>&emsp;There seems to be little strenght besides this. Indeed, this is a general Civ like Egypt. One
                        odd
                        boon is more codex slots, which may allow easier science legacy acquisition.

                        <br>&emsp;to go to Inca, 'to be of the mountain'. I think with principles we can succeed, and at least

                        about such principles as we struggle. For modern, I'll try for tycoon.
                        <br>&emsp;The Inca have a stronger archer, who does more from rough tiles, and a better scout, who can
                        see
                        through mountains. "This can hopefully protect our borders from the deity AI."
                        <br>&emsp;The terrace farm is their main advent, giving +6 food outright.This may also be boosted if the
                        settlement has a granary, plus even more from its innate adj. to mountains; but this extends to farms
                        too.
                        It must be built on a rought terrain tile adj. to a moutnain, town placement and district positioning
                        are
                        important earlier on. Also, Pachacutti gives food for buildings adj. to mountains, but this may conflict
                        with possible terrace farm locations. I am willing to change start bias for other leaders, so we have
                        mountains. Ben Franklin seems strong, as he can make up for early production and science shortcomings
                        (comapred to the gods).
                        <br>&emsp;Key things to look out for is a food boost to city centers adj. to mountains, or with 3 worked
                        mountain tiles. You may also get +1 happiness to moutnain tiles, giving them a 2 food, 1 prod. and 1
                        happiness total.
                        <br>&emsp;Borobodur gives +2 food and happiness to all quarters.
                        <br>&emsp;I think, for this game, we may benefit from obtaining the civ specific wonders, namely Angkor
                        Watt
                        and Machu Pichu. I believe much of each Civ's balance coincides with their ability to get such strenght.
                        Machu in particular, gives +8 culture to each quarter surrounding it.
                        <br>&emsp;You may get free movmenent over rough terrain, food from incoming trade routes, a poison
                        ability
                        from your archer, and production from rural population, and gold from urban. This last part cements the
                        growth orientation for the build.
                        <br>&emsp;For economics, you need trade routes and resource slots. Treasure fleets are tough as you may
                        not
                        have the means or land to acquire them. You may ignore this, but require more gold and influence to
                        achieve
                        modern victroy. In that case, you must acquire factory resources, get to industrialization, which is the
                        third colum of the bottom tech tree, then slot in a kind of resource into such city --cocoa for
                        instance,
                        but as many copies of it as you can fit. This gives increased points, up to 300 I believe. Then for a
                        grand
                        sum, plus some destination travel, victory.

                        I have no genuine interest to end wars or sickness. Indeed, by our common sense, we may see, as perhaps
                        propelled in our lingering state, a calmer view of the world that we wish to share; but generally, I am
                        in
                        such world and not looking to express this. But we may still: but it is merely of the problems which are
                        not. "The root of which, in our contention of those who claim otherwise, lie in family and experts."
                        <br>&emsp;As remarks expectation, you may say, that good or bad things will happen, and that we may be
                        gracious of this, or otherwise formidable; or we may be dispondent, or broken down. And so may we see
                        this
                        in other people.
                        <br>&emsp;There is just too little constancy in our life. We've been coming hither and fro, to the
                        effect
                        that our friends and relations are absent. As such, our baser life, in it's less than pointed harmony to
                        such things, has no easy means to develop such. "In many ways, the bluntness of said point, made it so
                        even
                        a relatively long period of time was not enough for something to manifest: and thus upon the changing
                        winds,
                        we went."
                        <br>&emsp;I say, merrily, and in the root of joy, that seeing the world near and more or less far around
                        you, brings me a calm delight and satiety. The sun rising, burning the later evening sky, this is simply
                        enough. "Doth the King be further appreciated too, for his many more bounties."
                        <br>&emsp;I lie though, with a sort of distastesfull passion, namely in the aversion to bad things
                        happening, or any novel goods which occuring at all. We apply ourselves little, nor admitt faint or
                        solid
                        points. "Were a bit to crept inward, 'as if our pains and struggles are dug in to joyous path: for we so

                        we are either in a state of roughness, or calm eruption."

                        unchained,
                        'but from what grounds are we enlightened from, and still carying the weight of'.
                        <br>&emsp;What seems most true, is that judgement was never, as it appeared, at our door. The folk
                        around us
                        were not interested in me, 'and only by our lack of harmony with them, did we spurr disdain'. Our
                        dissociation was led by me, and our less than amiable ways. Not that we were abbrasive, but that we did
                        not
                        partake in the wits and ways of other people. This was so, primarily, by our response to the requirments
                        around me. And, in our resolve to those, we felt little interest or validity in the ways of others.
                        <br>&emsp;It would have been nice if we could have seen the good around us; and do more of what we were
                        supposed to do, and by that, been more upright to mingle with others. But, in the principled duty, we
                        were
                        nothing but average, 'or sufficient, as to feel free from worry and shame'. It was as if someone had a
                        chain
                        around me, and instead of handle it mightily, and by those encumbent strides, walk amidst others, we
                        instead
                        cowered, 'and did only what would be pleasing and enough for the rope around us'.
                        <br>&emsp;In our early years, we were acclimitized to friends by natural circumstance; in that, by
                        familiarty, many orbited around. But, prior to our secondary years we moved, and from that point we
                        could
                        not look past or mingle, 'even if we were happy'. I don't recall being in turbelence at the time, and
                        was
                        more or less undrawn to the whims of others. "It was all gallantry and fluff." Indeed, our place in that
                        did
                        not need to be so, as if there was one soul place. But, at the time leading into highschool, our world
                        felt
                        very singular and defined. The peak of it held those properties, and so settled at the bottom, 'having
                        fun
                        with nerdy, unpopular kids'.
                        <br>&emsp;As we entered highschool, this disdain for fluff and esteem lingered with me. And despite
                        having a
                        few close friends, I never felt inclined to be apart of anything more. I don't feel too unique in this,
                        'but
                        of others around me, they felt like co-workers, who I'd see in spot, then leave to go home'. "They were
                        meantime people."
                        <br>&emsp;As it happened, time went on, and by natural familiarity, we became more acquainted. We had a
                        friend group, got a girlfriend, and things were alright. I acted to sharply though, 'as I would with
                        closer
                        friends, or family even'. This friend group of mine, 'who oddly enough, were not like those former, for
                        if
                        they were our bluntness would not mean so much'; but as it were, they were averse to me, and sent me
                        away.
                        "To my otherwise best friend too."
                        <br>&emsp;The basic view of this, is that success breads satisfaction, 'as you feel in line with the
                        neccessary path'. But if you find yourself overt to the things which give warmth around such amends,
                        then
                        you may not be so keen or excited to oblige. And as it happened, the judgement around me regarding
                        success,
                        was more or less explicit. Not in magnitude but seriousness, 'as none, despite the world never falling,
                        never felt or exclaimed passivity when it came to the elements of success'.
                        <br>&emsp;Our lack of place, in terms of friends and confidence, brought with it a sort of groove, of
                        which,
                        in terms of comfort, was only filled with dear times and close friends. This did not procure a far view
                        of
                        the world though. A view which those surrounding judgements seemed to aim at. "Thus our youth felt
                        aligned
                        to such ends, but with the complexion of a chore, rather than meaningfull task."
                        <br>&emsp;And I felt this deeply through my teenage years, this sort of sense that, despite our talents
                        and
                        character, 'that we were in fact pathectic, or at least a little average and lame'. Despite our grasp
                        for
                        peace amidst judgement, 'whereby our wish was not so in line with the ends of such judgement, rather
                        their
                        present satiety', so were we also defensive, and by that cynical, 'as if we saw others success, or felt
                        embarrased and ashamed, and thus exclaimed ourself (in angst and pride), to the futility of those around
                        me.'
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, by that natural familiarity, we entered a group of friends, and relationship, by
                        the
                        mere coelescence of our circumstance, rather than, had it been earlier, an actual embellishment of what
                        would procure such, and effectively. While our more or less inhereted state was one who's strucutre was
                        as
                        strong as our mozzying whims. "Which, encased with cynciism and defense, hoisted our social demise."
                        <br>&emsp;As the story goes, our consolation to such ways, was such, that of our friends and happiness,
                        we
                        amended to the fullest degree. But without solid candor or taste, we ignored, and in some sense
                        beligered,
                        those otherwise 'dutiful' judgements. "For which the road to philosophy lay."

                        see those who are one of the lot, ordinate to custom and the whole. There are those who make the

                        judgements. You befriend ignornance, 'being so comfortable with her, that you fear not her by your side:

                        a fuller sense, to describe the open, flowing, sweet complexion.

                        you
                        are not overwhelmed by them. "At least, upon being pushed over, you get back up; or return at least to a
                        steady standing." Another way of looking at this, is that by reason, we can accept things as fair, or at
                        least natural, and thus just to expect. "For many of our concerns come from indignation, and thus
                        complaimt."
                        <br>&emsp;Surrounding this is the matter of wisdom, which beyond one's response in things, tailors our
                        choices as to be driven towards the best of things, 'and not those which bring more concern, or
                        dullness'.
                        <br>&emsp;In this, we say, that fortune is either made or risen to, 'in that, we make solid choices, or
                        handle what's dealt to us'.
                        <br>&emsp;In this abscence of worry and fear, along with indecence, we relish the world around. For when
                        our
                        eye's aren't unerved, we see the leaves, bristling in the wind. Or when our ears are not so ladden with
                        drama and doubt, the birds song can be heard through the morn. And when our time is not spent on dull
                        affairs, or restless exertion, we may delight in the coming end, in which the sun sets, 'and all but the
                        deepest blues linger in the sky'.
                        <br>&emsp;There is so much to this. And, as one who finds good in writing or painting, 'so may we learn
                        the
                        grammar of the stars,' and by that, attune our mind to see her, hear her, 'and take her hand'.
                        <br>&emsp;This craft is the front end of liberty. As upon her liberated behind, lies the form in which
                        her
                        blossom's grow. "The route in which our heart sings: which, in said craft, marks how we practice."
                        <br>&emsp;The grand insight though, is that as a child, we live in relatively liberal ways. We go
                        outside,
                        run around, enjoy things for the pure sake of fun. But in being raised, the deedes of the world are
                        revealled to us. And generally, it is not the surpassing of these that we are reared to me, 'in that
                        we'd be
                        withtou concern', but that we should be eligble and sufficient in meeting them at all. As it were, upon
                        one's oblige, so do they learn that craft. For a child, in their liberal grandeur, is more like a
                        weightless
                        whim, 'going here and there as they wish, but with little style or form to bolden their claim'. As we
                        mature
                        and become able, so do we angle the form of our joy, 'as not to be so airy and basic, but rather full of
                        matter and love'. Indeed, as one learns to speak and run, so do these natural faculties draw more light
                        in;
                        whereby, near and upon ouur younger condition, so is our delight more mature, 'in that our childish
                        whims,
                        weighed upon by common deed, rear their head to a more definite end'. Indeed, such an end, 'as seen by
                        one
                        aged and stated,' is the mard of a meaningfull life: as such a sight is born from one truly living:
                        while a
                        child is one whose life is being made for them.
                        <br>&emsp;I find then, that as our contentment with the deeds given become uneven, that our wishes and
                        care
                        for the world become extended. "Whereby we fear for those in war, of far off lands and places; or we
                        more
                        merrily seek the breads of Paris, or wilds of Bengal". This is no solid remark, 'and is better deemed a
                        stain, upon our lapse of reason and or might'.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, I see that our own ease within obligate matters, is less defined or just in regards
                        to
                        children, 'but beyond our passion, not much else'. I may, rightly or in lust, seek to contribute, or be
                        seen, but besides that, 'so is our solidity claimed'. For I can, with the git of moutnains and bookish
                        delight, support myself in such, through means which I am more or less pleased, and reliable stated to.
                        In
                        terms of taxes and correspondence, I am all but nearly there. "Lacking only the words my dream's
                        require." I
                        am a manager, the breadmaker, the comfort, a stand, all in myself, 'in solitude or company'.
                        <br>&emsp;I am not always seen as someone who is such, and that be it of happiness, natural ends,
                        impassioned deeds or glorious heights,that so are we unbecoming, and by that, in need of pressure and
                        suggestion to do so. Whether we are near said voices or far away, it is our own solidity that keeps me
                        about, 'and with pleasure listens, openly, nor with any fear of dismissal, nor integral doubt'.

                        it will remove any concerns.
                        <br>&emsp;I'd like to do some sort of word exercises before we go; which will be shoes on 840.
                        <br>&emsp;We can walk in the near door, place our scooter and jacket, and bag too. I will need to eat,
                        and
                        likely at our first break. Let it be early if need be, and deal with your physicality for lunch. Maybe
                        we'll
                        take two 15s then lunch. Just make sure you eat. Pack a banana and t.mix, and we'll eat during break or
                        lunch.
                        <br>&emsp;As for in and outs, let's be cordial and prepared, so it's easier to rightly leave. If chance
                        has
                        it, we'll go out the side door. Otherwise, its 2 minutes to leave, a few mintues home, and few mintues
                        back,
                        and nearly right in and ready to go. "Leaving our bag with scooter is a permissable choice." That gives
                        20
                        minutes at home.
                        <br>&emsp;Our jeans, shirt and sweater are clean, though I could use some laundry now. Less it's
                        freezing,
                        I'll just wear my raincoat. Because I sleep in our grey one, I need to get a secondary one. Maybe we'll
                        start sleeping in the checkered one, and leave our grey one for walks and outings.

                        and
                        whoever else.
                        <br>&emsp;I am frightened, as our judgement of things is absent. Fairly, in reproach, or with the
                        mingling
                        of lazyness.
                        <br>&emsp;Other people's judgement errode me then, 'as I have nothing to contend with'. In response, I
                        accept that they are simpling speaking as so, and better communicate myself. In a way, all the reasons
                        which
                        I'd use to reject and or invalidate their argument, is a way in which our own is lacking: and thus, of
                        our
                        own speaking, we are reproached. For there is so much I don't know, nor do I wish to judge based on an
                        incomplete picture. "Judging someone by their cover, is poor, because you do not know what's inside. The
                        point being, that you don't know something entirely, and judging from so." It is not often that this is
                        recognized, 'and one's gut is given esteem', rather the sense that there is more to something is not
                        known.
                        From that, I have given many things a deep and honest reflection. There are many communities in the
                        world,
                        and not much in terms of wordly action is done but by a select piece of them. But, indirectly does this
                        inform me, 'as if the breadth of the world I know validates our abscence from current thought, as there
                        is
                        only more clearly a great deal I don't know'. Yet, this does not explain or fortell what will happen. It
                        may
                        suggest how things mean, 'as not even I believe, rightly, that the world will erupt'. But there may be
                        conflict, and of a violent sort. This is sad, and once settled peacefully under the notion that such
                        thing
                        wouldn't happen at all. But just as there are combatants in the world else, so may it cross our door. My
                        judgement is not such that me or my family are at risk, nor my community even. But of those who are, so
                        doth
                        the root of our contempt lay, 'for those instigating such belidgerence'.
                        <br>&emsp;I have simply not given these matters any serious thought. I know to little, and am more broad
                        in
                        my source of meaning, and thus not spurred to contempt. Indeed, the feeling I get, is that people see
                        the
                        bad in entirety, 'as if their view of things is evily saturated', and thus their contempt lay. And,
                        beyond
                        our expectation of anything happening at all, 'where the bad is nearer than I'd imagine', and our
                        otherwise
                        steadfastness in the vastness in which strands of misfortune lay, that so are we, in our blankedness,
                        comparably saturated by other's own inflammed views. "There deep colors quickly saturate me."
                        <br>&emsp;And indeed, all that has occured, is that in our fairness, our life, our place in the times,
                        that
                        we are not well of, or safe in ignorance. At least, of that which we are in fact afraid of, in the
                        meagerest
                        of work, or in desire of, 'for things far off and way', that so are we acordingly unrooted and set, and
                        by
                        that, 'subject to the whims of our baser impurity; which, as they say, reflects the pangs of maturity,
                        whereby you see the world in whole and finely, yet upon your lapse, so doth irriation lay'.

                        Liberty is the encumabcne of a condition, and doing so well enough, that your unburdened by it. Not that
                        you
                        are relieved, but without the weight of it: despite it still being there.
                        <br>&emsp;From this, I see the coarse of all our lives.
                        <br>&emsp;For a government may see reason to fight, and by that encourage and or demand that citizens
                        comply. This is a condition thus laid upon you, or one which you may be emtionally drawn to or simply
                        interested in.
                        <br>&emsp;But the point, is that you don't try and remove problems, rather treat them well so that they
                        weigh on you not. Some things are indeed misfortunes, while other's are just. As I am right to work
                        despite
                        being at home, nor am I misfortuned to one day die. "I can't even think of a misfortune I have, merely
                        things that are fairly asked of me."
                        <br>&emsp;The goods of reason then, are those which come from this oblige to circumstance, as not to
                        overt
                        it, or remedy it's ware upon you; but to instead fitfully amend, 'and feel the weight no longer'. To
                        rise to
                        it's task, and become light and mighty in your handle on it.
                        <br>&emsp;In regards to my life, so are we coming up to work, then home. Masturbation is helpful, as
                        there
                        are pretty girls who I may be unerved around. But I don't care for porn, as it exasterbates my
                        interests,
                        and makes me more nervous. Father is leaving next week, and we'd be wise to lube up. We still have some,
                        and
                        we ought set up our bin, as to get the things we need.
                        <br>&emsp;Laundry wise, we have jackets, sheets, blanets and clothes. In terms of showering, ought we do
                        it.

                        I feel fair in thinking that certain things are not right to start now. Our yoga for instance, or online
                        dating; these have been notions in my mind for some time; but upon our work, that seems the priority,
                        and
                        setting those other things up feels like an addition upon our flow into work.
                        <br>&emsp;In the weeks prior, each point has been a hurdle. One which we've crossed, but with little but
                        relief sought after. Now, were in motion, going to and fro work. And I won't elaborate, but the very
                        fact
                        that we are employed, and in a spread out fashion, along with being near people and as such regulated,
                        makes
                        our stay at home right. "And is merely a proper form in our current being."
                        <br>&emsp;But as were going through this motion, certain things are around. And I think of Jess, who
                        seems
                        to work so much then come home, but does nothing else --short of seeing her friends. I feel similar, in
                        that
                        there are all these things floating infront of me, but my care to grab them is low. Time must go on, and
                        through general acquiescence, so can we find the moments to address these things, and make them more
                        near
                        and present. Our recovery for instance, in yoga, has come plentfiuly along. But our stability still
                        leaves
                        alot to be desired. We need not do it to repair though, as we are already fine. The mark of it is of a
                        mere
                        recognition, 'as if the scent of it had caught our attention'. Naturally, and for the better, we'll
                        address
                        those things then. I see this in terms of our bookmarking, finding more books, reading and tailoring our
                        own. The study of light, clouds and graphics fairs similar. As do our yoga guides and or self made
                        videos.
                        <br>&emsp;All we ought do is go through some range of motion, and likely prior to a easy rest leading
                        into
                        the work day. Our investment in fit 4 less seems valid, 'as recovering makes the joy of work more
                        accessible, nor our liberties weighed upon'.
                        <br>&emsp;I'd say, that despite us being cozy and at home, and justfully through our employment, that we
                        may
                        spend our time tightening our other threads; namely, in how we clean and bathe, communicate our
                        judgements
                        and or withdrawals from others. These are part of who we are, at home, with friends, or at work. You may
                        not
                        notice these, as you do the labor of PCX, 'but so these flames come ultimately'. And may we serve our
                        memory
                        of this happening, with the candor of what would simply quench trouble.

                        The form of our way, is such, that by some course, we sought peace over elation. But as this manifested,
                        our
                        aim became one in which the abscence of problems was sought, rather than overcumbing them. "The effect
                        being
                        one, in which we are without any opposition, but thus a little bare and in our lack of a response."
                        <br>&emsp;And so in our reflections, we stood on the grounds which so freely gazed at the stars; but by
                        that, recognized the need for acquisition, to provide for this. For so long, this hill of freedom was
                        sought, 'with hopes that all requirments were gone'. Yet some unhdoutbedly stayed.
                        <br>&emsp;I think of our childhood, and our approach into youth and all it's contention. In such times,
                        be
                        it young or old, we had deeds to meet, and obligations at that. Some felt unneccessary, other's fair.
                        But so
                        did the increasing pleas for things beyond our post, leave me unnerved with such present, but not either
                        drawn or convinced of such beyond.
                        <br>&emsp;Our story is so, that of our cares, so were they concentrated on the sprouts of our present,
                        'and
                        our dedication to all that cultaivted that'. We steared away from the fears and desires ahead, and
                        sought
                        all the good that came from being rightly present.
                        <br>&emsp;The truth though, is that less there was a total abscence of demand, then the meager amount
                        you
                        had saw us buckle under our 'liberal press'. Which is to say, that we lacked any good that came with the
                        benefits and or commradery of future regards. And in our present stake, so were blossomed, but without
                        much
                        of a frame against actual demands. Indeed, we obliged to such deeds, 'but also fortified our liberty, or
                        present being'.
                        <br>&emsp;There is this element of craft, or defintiion rather, in which, the whole and shining world
                        seen
                        from our point of liberty, needs a sort of hilt, or at least foundation to stand on. And this was so,
                        for
                        based on the good we had, and the common deeds to get it, the meager amount of this could not suffice
                        for
                        the loose joys of our liberty. In pure abscence, 'as one experiences on a weekend, or over the summer',
                        such
                        joys are fufulling. But once outward regards come to be, such enjoyments deflate. And so giving some
                        form
                        and craft to such things, prevents the common deeds of the world from weighing you down.
                        <br>&emsp;My adolescence was very much about raising the height of our joy, and finding worth in doing
                        so.
                        "Even at the cost of everything else." My road to adulthood though, was in the accepetance of our place
                        in
                        life, as a person, a man, a son, brother, friend. And as such, we could not live as though our liberty
                        would
                        be uncontended, 'or withouth the whiffs of demand'. Indeed, at the beginning of this stage, I found much
                        console in this, as I saw the joy that could occur around our deeds as sufficient. "Yet our deeds felt
                        like
                        things to run from; be it by our own ware, or the feeling of shame by others." It never could be enough,
                        even though I felt it so.
                        <br>&emsp;Moving forward, we tried to deal with such matters; but to an end which ultiamtely accepted
                        them
                        as being so. "And nothing but for our dreams to wonder about, in ceasing." As such, we did find our
                        place in
                        a motion which was right and relatively stable; and one which we were more free to accept. As such, we
                        held
                        those initial sentiments of form and definition, 'as to give the joy surrounding our condition a means
                        for
                        volume and constance'. But via cirucmstance, we were granted entry into a weightless scenario, and left
                        to
                        our whims and ways.
                        <br>&emsp;The oddity in life though, is that even without employment, you still have the wares of your
                        health and natural state. From this, I always felt that it was a remark of other's scorn, that I could
                        not
                        relieve myself as I would under a clear condition, but in this liberal case. While I was up north
                        though, I
                        did not accept or begrieve such a notion. As despite feeling the wish for it, I ultimately accepted that
                        the
                        happiness we cared for would not come about through such permission. "That even without judgement, we
                        still
                        ough behave ourselves." But the reality, was that we were admirably flourishing in a place that needed
                        me
                        not to. Indeed, had we been more occupied, than our firmer want of comfort and relief would be more
                        fitting
                        with the demands of our scenario. But we ultimately choose to retain our lack of condition, and live as
                        the
                        happiness required of that needed. For we were not pleased to be absent of worry and time, but otherwise
                        soft and idle. Nor, at the time, did we wish for invovlement or promising activity. I simply choose to
                        live
                        as the form of a non-conditioned happiness stated.
                        <br>&emsp;Practically, this was never as easy to commiserate. As you could only do so much; nor was our
                        environment free from pokes and prods. "And indeed, our adolescent dreams came in the form of that which
                        would heighten such freedoms: to make them preferably so."
