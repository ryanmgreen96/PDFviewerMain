            <div class="text-body">So I can actually think for a moment.
                <br>&emsp;Foremost, I wish to have kids. Our desire is not palletable, but our aim is in line with
                our
                natural expectations. Similar to our agreement with death, so do we see children as likely; and to
                such
                presumed end, I am happy, and pleased. As for their rearing, I see simplicity heralding their home
                and
                stead, along with a honorable union with the goods and harmony of the world. I see us rearing them
                to speak
                well and clearly, to listen, to walk, talk, breathe, write and run. And from there, for their own
                application, or
                our shared steps abroad, so we'll be. I understand the pre-requisite of money, in that a room, a
                stroller,
                food and diapers are required. Nor is there a short amount of odd preperations: an emergency, check
                ups,
                glasses, dental. But these are either mended by simpler habits; are not so precarious in their
                acquisition;
                or can be attended to when and on the day. Moreover, the basis for chidlren is a dutiful one; and in
                that,
                our pecuniary needs are oriented to. In that, assuming we have someone who was as interested as I to
                birth
                and raise, and thus share the load of attention and means, that so will we, in our correspoding
                means, have
                likely measures to bend them further, and by that, address any momentary or forseen requirments.
                <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I can say that our draw to this is but a formality. As I do not have a
                spark
                inside me, nor any emebers which our relations are kindling. All it seems, is that on this path we
                stand,
                akin to death. The mode of our life is such, that progress, the abscence of contributing a new
                member, and
                our otherwise prior interests, leads me not but to a proprtioned conclusion. Namely, that of our
                life, in
                its investment and regard, ought it be, in expectation and according preference, tailored with such
                points
                in mind. Our regard is not so heavy though, for such a path is not mighty in its horizon. "For we
                may then
                see, with proper deeds and response; nor can we offer but a little preperation; as such matters are
                by
                nature, laid out."
                <br>&emsp;What is right and wrong then is not, in this case, guilded by any sense that we ought have
                children now, or shortly. There's no civil or customary need for us to do so. And indeed, little of
                such
                sentiment is ever pressed upon me.
                <br>&emsp;Oddly though, I think that our happiness is the lever by which others express themselves:
                for in
                that, in cheer and candour, they wish. Yet the irony, is that what said happiness amounts to is not
                so
                clear, except what I can only pin point as a basic need to be true to those future points of
                children and
                death.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, we tend to recieve suggestions along the lines of that which would furnish me
                with
                fortune and friends. Namely, that of a bigger house, and a acceptable sociallife.
                <br>&emsp;For one, these remarks feel unfiltered or assessed; as no one ever asks you if you are
                really
                happy. At least, if they do, there is seldom an agreement on what such happiness means. For even if
                I am,
                and then begin to slip, the resorted expression is one of ventures for the sake of things esteemed
                to make
                you happy. But our prior happiness, as we politely claimed, is not concluded as being poor in
                princiuple,
                but rather futily achieved.

            <div class="text-body">
                So their are two main elements: duty and happiness. The form of the latter is all that's worth
                remarking,
                while the former is guilded by our baser needs, and the mode theiracquired.
                <br>&emsp;Surrounding this though is the direction of our lives. For what we need is not so ardently
                agreed
                upon. Nor, is the form of happiness heralded in terms of propiety, or even merrit. "Which is to say,
                that
                the matter of happiness, be it crumby or pure, may not be deeemd important, or appropriate even: as
                duty may
                hold the our deepestcare."
                <br>&emsp;In that, it is quite easy to say that our desired form, is one where the good we
                experience is
                ocnsistent, merrily met, and of a wholesome sort; as to accomodate such qualities, whilst also being
                tender,
                warm and sweet. Nor are we given much more difficulty in saying that our needs are so as would make
                us
                secure; that if we had some thing, that we would be full, fed and sure. Moreover, we might say, that
                our
                means to such things is done via ourselves or some collective: and that at some extent of the latter
                is
                society made, and an according economoy where our particulare actions within the efficiencies of the
                whole,
                treats us to a return in which we can apply to such products of the whole.
                <br>&emsp;None of this is hard tosay.
                <br>&emsp;But that we ought fear our dreasm, as if some messenger is suggesting something; be it of
                fear or
                oppertunity. Or whether or not our foresight of death is one that speaks of peace and certain
                finality, or
                rather shines upon us with some promise; one of which we can see, relish in, and from there
                anticpate, but
                also surrender to and oblige, as pertains to esteemed requisites for entry. These things, alongside
                many
                others --in both identities and meaning- are not so clear.
                <br>&emsp;Where I sit then is in a state of private confidence. A state of which, by all things
                likely, I am
                not deterred or afraid by what is apt to come. And as such, I may personally be, in the moment
                happily, and
                sturdy to the future tocome.
                <br>&emsp;But a matter of deep importance remains. One of which characteries the nature of a
                species, and by
                that, a feature which nearly all living things share: progeny.
                <br>&emsp;For these remarks of ours are not merely attributions to mysteries ahead of us, but also
                matters
                of the dearest concern; for upon our natural stride, whereby another is birthed upon us, that so in
                our
                provision of security and happiness (for them), do these obscurities lay. Our time is admittedly
                garnished
                by age and sensibility. And despite our contemporary release from primitive views and superstition,
                so are
                we are least sure and bounded by the strenght in our appraoch, to whichever future lays. One's
                parenting
                though is not, in general, or in any particularly esteemed way, propitiated by such confidence. For
                we may
                raise them to be a strong as us, whereupon they approach the mysteriees of life with equal might and
                gust.
                But so are we playing with the roots of another, as opposed to our own secure trunk. For we can
                already see,
                think, consider and align. Our child though is relying on us to do much of this for them. And
                whether it is
                our action they need, or mere guidance, so mustn't we compare our relation to the world to their
                own.

                It is hard not to say, that akin to a headache, or an injury, that whatever relieved it now, would
                trump all
                other matters. Nor would other things be given muchregard.
                <br>&emsp;Our mind is thus not very clear, as we have been sleeping late, and not exercising. These
                are not
                from bad habits mind you, but a whithering of our good ones. The principles to be fair regarding
                such
                efforts are not in themselves poor. But our general momentum has been tilted from the recent months;
                nor
                have the principles had time to settle and embellish themselves. This is indeed the flow of ourlife.
                <br>&emsp;In that, all that matters is our time ahead. Nearby, I see the oppertunity to find some
                security,
                in that we may work at Walmart or Superstore. This will be nice, and indeed is neccessary to stay
                comfortably at home. I cannot say this will procure stability though. At least, in our muddied
                state, I can
                see that our time at home will not produce what we seek further ahead. Indeed, our muddiedness does
                not let
                us be content with what we have; for if we were, then such far off things would not be either
                hankered
                towards, nor with grievence at their distance.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, it is an akward time, as I am not so privy to communicate: it being the holidays
                afterall.
                Despite that, we've made three attempts thus far, each ending in a miss. I don't fear the clock in
                regards
                to a potential leave in Februrary; but knowing if our course is such would be nice to know.
                Especially so we
                may communicate and come to an understanding. Dad is leaving in a few days for Palm Springs, as is
                Mom
                leaving for Kamloops. And so the months end will come, and we may potentially be going. Right now
                though, I
                am not sure what we're going to do. I fret not at the choices, only that I am both lingering or
                halted from
                learning about the one I oughtmake.
                <br>&emsp;I say we phone as we can. I would rather work at West Walmart, but East or Superstore will
                do. My
                stake in them saying yes, albeit a nice turn of events, is not so tight. In fact, I think it in many
                ways
                wrong. If we were more secure, through ourselves, then the comfort and harmony would be alright. I
                might
                even lean in and find some steadyness. But I know in my heart, nor am excused form the thought upon
                any
                personal waiving, that somewhere else is where I'm meant togo.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, I mean to invest myself. If only because there is oppertunity and need to do
                so. Such
                needs are small, nor is their prescence near. But the stability of our life is such, that in terms
                of the
                happiness which we seek, ought we be on route, or in line at least, to something which our happiness
                woudl
                be find to float towards. We need not rush, but our personal efforts relish the liberty to sink into
                themselves; but such an agreement comes when your foresight is checked by appropriate actions. What
                this
                deems then, is not so much that we would reach forward with haste, or be trepidatious so long as we
                weren't
                now as we see to be latter, rather that we were merely on course, directed, and set to reach such
                end by our
                natural paces. This is why we felt the need to leave home in Kamloops, as we knew that our time
                there was
                not so kept. And despite being happy, I found it hard to sink in and be truly so; for I knew change
                was
                coming. Such change though comes from a sort of honesty to what is required to stability. I don't
                seek
                children, but I do recognize our future place with them. The slightest bit of current happiness is
                enough
                not to worry about that; but as even one string of our current peace is tugged at, so does our
                apparent
                incongruety with such future become apparent.

                So a mistake was once made. It occured when we choose to leave our post, of which our later
                reflections
                would reveal to have been prosperous. But in any case, we left, and moved north to a comfortable
                home.
                Indeed cicrumstance was what called us. But our willingness to go was far too keen and excitable
                than our a
                call for dutyreflected.
                <br>&emsp;In this, I have learned that happiness is not some hidden treause, laid upon broken glass
                and
                smolten steel. As Montainge says, 'it lies out in the open, pleased to be treated (and thus
                beneovlent) by
                any who would take her hand'. I can't quite say when this remark came to pass, but I do recall
                thinking that
                our congruency with the world, or affibility at least, in terms of our 'hand to happiness', was
                neither
                unacceptibility, or with much difficulty to manifest. I have learned things, and indeed, our
                adolscence has
                lost its youtfull edge. But I mention this only to highlight our naivety and slant of incongruence,
                with
                respect to our being happy in a worldy way. For I do submitt that our views on this matter were not
                so open
                or admitted in times past; where we were either agasint the common way, leary about our place in it,
                and at
                any rate resolved to live outside of it, or merely to the extent required. "I seldom thought,
                outside of
                wishes and fancy, that I would freely and fullystride."

                So the strides of our life are duly met by circumstance. The weather, for instance, changes the day,
                which
                then changes the days ahead of that; which in effect, contributes to the periodcoming.
                <br>&emsp;Our resolve though is merely to learn, so that when it rains, or time has come with her
                many
                demands, we may fruitfullyoblige.
                <br>&emsp;In this, I know foremost that our happiness needs rest. From this though, there lies the
                trouble
                in ceasing acitivity, for the external motions of your life are leaned on, as is your own liberty to
                breathe, and be. In many ways, I could describe this mode as one of stability and progress. For my
                home does
                come into question; whereby the extent to which I can see, by virtue of our stability, bears upon me
                a
                horizon which my rest is not angst to reach. For the alternative is one, whereup you become still,
                see
                little, and feel like little is shown ahead: whereby you wish to further yourself. In line with
                that, is the
                sentiment of progress. Rest does not exclusivley fall on this notion, as our working stress and
                occupied
                place, may also wish for some promise ahead. This is merely an eligibility though, or rather some
                sense of
                oppertunity which your natural strides can meet. For I do not neccesarily need that which said
                promise would
                bring, rather that our current path, as ordained and still, will naturally reach; be it through a
                means or
                the concurentend.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, I fret not over things I wish to have; nor do I even humour them, as I know in
                principle, and in awareness of the tamber of the desire, that such things are not worth much. By
                that
                though, in all things appropriate, I may still try. Not fretlesslessly for grifted success, but
                rather for
                things which we have no recourse to not. The point, is that in the case for work, I may ask, as such
                success
                would be something were gratefull toward. But we already have much. And my starting point ought to
                have
                been, that what we have is not the primary matter, rather our use of things. It is like someone in
                water who
                was born to be in such, who seeks for more, of a quality kind let's say; but this is merely an
                addition, an
                arrangment or cirucmstnace; for your being is already one and with water. And swimming then is the
                crucial
                matter. And indeed, working at superstore would give us a bucket full; nor would walmart fail to
                give me a
                pale's worth. But our swimming will only come so far. As we will still be in this relatively small
                pond, no
                matter how much more it is filled up.

                Our truest desire is akin to a meal, whereby the taste of the food was not only relevant, but our
                company,
                the lighting, even the breakfast early in the day. All things work this way for me, and as such, our
                life
                being swell, is but an aggregrate of all good things blending together to form a delivioushole.
                <br>&emsp;I need only mention each one then, with some relations which would elevate our interest.
                <br>&emsp;For one, Civ is coming out. And despite our recent flatness, so has our curiosity began to
                peak;
                all in part because our consumption of it through the fall had died down. When I see our scenario
                though, I
                see the possibility of moving, and the quandery of finding work from that. The game comes out a
                month from
                now, so our ability to anticiapate comes in conflcit with our apprhensiosn aod or preperation of our
                time
                ahead. This in many ways is the key reason I'd like to stay at home, and rightly. For Diablo is also
                coming
                out. Admittedly, prior to anything that would technically happen; but so is the good I see a little
                capped
                by not being able to seefurther.
                <br>&emsp;In that, I can say, that what I seek is stability. I want to imagine ourselves working
                from home,
                or training to be in IT, or running a creator buisness. I also wish to find some commradery in our
                teamates,
                showing up on a regular basis, feeling that there is somewhere for us to be. This sens of
                contentment,
                whether it is in line for future investement or pure content, so would it please me to bear some
                union
                between our intent and that of which our parents see. For they do not know that I agree to the
                potential for
                chidlren; and that seeing so, I only would care for one; or that I have such concerns for education.
                That,
                and my care for travel is not something I attest. For any feeling for it, or excitement, similar to
                other
                anticpations which furnish everything else, so do I see these cares for aborad to be but sparks from
                our
                seperated self; whereby nothing near or dear is close, nor something fair and hearty further seen.
                And I
                wish for them to hear this; nor do I want any pity, suggestion, our doubt as regards any esteem or
                ability
                to travel. "I wish not for their rose tainted appeals or support."
                <br>&emsp;What I want overall is a place where I no longer see, but happily am. I will endure,
                embrace,
                steady and raise. But so would I care for somewhere that I saw progress and habitiation as our path,
                rather
                than dreams, reservation, justification or conquest, born from a spot of comfort and flow.
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, the core of our desires is in being able enough to be and set, as to
                properly
                engrain and sprout in our reflective way. For only is that the way for truth and measure, moral and
                ground.
                We need no other. And indeed, our experiene of this, by the virtue of principle in our temporary
                states,
                speaks to me as something which holds the evident promise of growth; but also a contrary brace to
                our
                otherwise whims and discontent: of which comes by the nature of that temporary post. "Our principle
                merely
                brings the iteration of our place to a close, and makes what comes to be a upper portion of the
                wave,
                seemingly all there is: by which I act, reflect and be." Thereupon I grown, learn and beckon, as to
                choose
                where I'll further move to. Only, the crux of our adolescent lives, is in living so purely, albeit
                with a
                bulge, in that sheltered peak, that so is the lesson worth decidiing from not one which is laid for
                the gain
                of such peak, but the lands beneath us: where right livinglies.

                So exercise is exercise, as is stretching. But food is always a source of discretion; as you may
                care
                little, or a lot, and the selection for your choices is never soclear.
                <br>&emsp;I can say, in terms of stretching, I would like to further our roster. Our hips have
                recieved good
                work in the recent month, and our shoulders have had some nice treatment; but indeed our chest and
                spine
                need more work, along with our legs.
                <br>&emsp;Regarding food then, I feel a little famoished. This cannot be overlooked as a reason not
                to forgo
                exercise; for even upon doing that once, I feel stronger. So the balance of our needs is such that
                our
                improvement in exercise will equate.
                <br>&emsp;I would say then that food is so unclear, for its purpose is merely associative, in that
                it
                supports your activity. By that, our interest is to play some Diablo, watch some videos and Clone
                Wars, edit
                some music and our website, walk, stretch, and do some running and pushups. Doing the latter
                definitely
                brings me into a compressed state, initially at least. So having something for that, in both comfort
                and
                recovery is usefull.
                <br>&emsp;It is suppose to be a bit warmer tomorrow and Sunday, and less of a downpoor; then it is
                not
                suppose to rain for a few days. I mean to do some more pushups, despite the risk of comrpession.
                This
                benefits most from a lack of firm activity. Getting out then is nice, and food motivates this.
                Perhaps we
                can go to Fresh Co (and if not Superstore) Sundany evening.
                <br>&emsp;This leaves us with needs for today and tomorrow. Bulk wise, we have plenty of grain
                --though we
                do need to cook barley. "Our soup is quite salty, so prior to butter, and large amounts, just use it
                as a
                seasoner to your grain." We have no oranges or kale, so we'll get those. Nor are there bananas.
                Bread wise
                we have bagels for tonight, and some whole wheat bread. We can grab some E.muffins on Sunday.
                Protein wise
                we have little, thought Quinoa is fine. I reckon that tomrrow, if not Sunday afternoon, will hold
                the
                compressed effects (if and any) from tomorrows session. So some Tofu would be nice.
                <br>&emsp;Our recent efforts have turned me to calcium pills; though their bulk content of other
                viatmins
                makes it quite difficult to process. The perill of not doing so is not present; though I am fully
                aware that
                we are not drinking soy any more. I am not sure I wish to do so on a consistent basis. Nor is almond
                milk
                pleasing, or accessible, as you must replensih twice per week. The vitamins are relatively cheap and
                last
                for long. Perhaps we could forgo all things unessential, and choose gummies for easier digestion.
                <br>&emsp;As it stands, our midday has switched from smoothies to bananas, seeds and dried fruit.
                This has
                worked well, but the stretch by which were satiated seems shorter. Normally, we'd have a smoothie
                and bu
                full till dinner. Whereas now, were quite bare by the later afternoon. Exercise may have something
                to do
                with this, as our preferreed schedule would see some roughage and fruit had early in the day. "We
                also have
                several apples, which can serve our eveningventures."
                <br>&emsp;All in all, Kale, oranges, a few bananas, 1 tofu and some dried fruit, will set us for the
                days.
                We'll get some dinner on Sunday, and treat ourself to the tofu; and we'll get more bread or
                essentials then.
                Our soup is full, and we can make Barley and lentils for ittoday

                So I seek no child. Simply, I am already fine, pleased and happy. Our choices have not faciliated
                deep
                stability, nor the comfort and growth which all people seek. But our actions are quite good, and our
                abscence of bad one's keeps mehappy.
                <br>&emsp;Oppertunity wise, I am not inclined to derail and or abate our current happiness. Such a
                sentiment
                falls on the dearness to certain things. These things are in need of their own attention, as in the
                actual
                moves in a dance, and that of provision, as to smoothly satiate our needs. Taking further steps, be
                it in
                investment or employment, have some promise, and eligbility to be equitable to our dearer ways. But
                I find
                their worth to be somewhat novel, and based on the future, rather than the present --as we can
                concieve of
                as being. And, as such, I find that our resistance to not seeing such horizon is one where we are
                simply
                obliged to be more present and clear now: which is not an easy thing to: for you must think, be
                honest, iron
                out your divots and holes: and by that token, submitt to theirprescence.
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, our unease at merely being happy, comes down to the steadyness by which we
                consider
                being so. For such remarks are in practice, beyond us, and at that, of a future which further dreams
                compare. This is why we write, as we are trying to be honest, and reach out for the light near us,
                and
                simply remedy the shortness of warmth: whereby we then color our ends with the dreams were
                experiencing,
                near and now, as if we were pleased with our liberty, to be moral andmodern.

                then so can't we find harmony with them: to which we nerously approach. Indeed, others may rustle

                <br>&emsp;But, due to normal needs, and corresponding amends, so may we rest on approach to such by
                the
                actions we know we'll take: ones which we can also remark upon ourarrival.
                <br>&emsp;Simply, the matter here is one of negativity, whereby we see a threat, in terms of some

                may actually benefit from these means, be it in baser elements, or those of color and spring. And of
                the
                groove which sprouts amidst this centered stone, so may the land rise, by which you see thehorizon.

                So we have our duty coming. All in all, if I were King, proposed, and with expressive fortune, than
                the
                manner of such oblige would not thwart me. And even if it was deemed to be somewhat negativie, so
                would the
                reason for it bear meagainst.
                <br>&emsp;But, as it were, it feels like were doing this for an unknown reason. Despite this feeling
                arbitrary and contrived, I can see that there is an ultiamteprinciple.
                <br>&emsp;Yet, said course of action holds with it very little animation to such principle. All it
                really
                amounts to is our progeny, our leadership and or expression. I cannot see where these things lie
                though. As,
                our insight is such, that of our common course, where the paces are liberal and rich, so do we
                naturally
                proceed, and by thave, have a sort brim cheer as we approach whatever's ahead. Only, when duty
                comes, or
                friction at that, we tend to loose our sight, and beckon to the obscurity by which we are either a)
                obliged
                for such principle, or b) destined for such, for which said principle is attested to, and our duty a
                stable
                means for so.
                <br>&emsp;Bringing this all in, we have our happiness, and of an abundant sort. And from this, is
                where I
                see. Though, all the likely born from the still present deeds upon us; only, by the times and our
                sensibility, we simply had more room and means to be so inclined. Yet, the limits of that, and
                pressures,
                still brought me to be so principally inclined.

                So dreams come because we are undoutdedely stressed. Nature is ever upon us. I don't see this as
                some
                seperation, as if wind upon rock was a dual matter. But I do see, that, by the whims of the whole,
                or
                however you'd state it, that so must we attend to our basic deed: breathe, eat, sleep, rest,
                survive. These
                all come about because we are inbued with pleasure and pain. Across the range of these, we tend to
                predict
                and anticiapate for the sake of.
                <br>&emsp;As children we are not less filled with obligations than those of us older. The form is
                different,
                but we are still equally in thedomain.
                <br>&emsp;I say this, for one may think, in privalage or congruency, that they may be absent of such
                conditions, and by that, free to experience all that they seek. There is merrit to this, but the
                sentiment
                needs a strongerstatement.
                <br>&emsp;Simply, as we grasp for breathe, so do we perk up at the sun's shine. This is akin to our
                awareness of threats, or ease upon a coming relief. Happiness is merely this forrayed into an
                positive
                abundance. Whereby, those things which spark our less than begrieved minds, are seen, sought and
                attended
                to. "I can say that our past has dealt us a rich hand in these regards. But so do I sulk a little at
                this
                state of mind being disturbed. Besides the lapse of such goods, the blurr of our sight of them is
                what
                brings me down themost."

                So I woke up a nearly 330 --and admittedly, it was a slight bit before that. I can't say exactly,
                but I fell
                asleep around 7, meaning we had a full sleep. For one, a full sleep, compared to 6 or 7 hours, seems
                all the
                difference between good and bad living. Moreover, achieving this ought be done so thorugh earlier
                sleep,
                rather than sleeping in later.
                <br>&emsp;At any rate, I would love to wake up at 5:00 on the regular. Today felt like it went by
                blazing
                fast; and despite that, we felt cool and collected, and sure as well. I'd say going to be around 8
                seems the
                best. At least, no more eating, or screen time. Just walk, stretch, read and rest. Perhaps we won't
                be as
                tired. But I'd still benefit from waking earlier, and letting our appropriate bedtime be sooner.
                Last I
                checked, it was noon oclock, and now were reaching 2. But its near time for dinner, and we have so
                much room
                to go. Our days in fact feel longer and all aroundbetter

                One of the realities of living with other people, is that they are going to do things which are
                either a)
                annoying, or b) contemptible. Partciualarly, with family, this sense will be magnififed, as such
                things will
                feel worse coming from you, nor so easily communicated. "Things thusharbour."
                <br>&emsp;But the relaity is that our discontent with such matters, no matter the degree, come from
                an
                unsteadyness in ourself. Namely, that we have no real grasp on things, and are thus unerved by
                things which
                press upon us; as we have no natural press, nor sturdy grounds forbracing.
                <br>&emsp;I'll say then, that our life is such, that of a sort of flow, we are going into one of
                stability.
                It cannot be overlooked that this state will include work and self-provision. But it is also so
                different
                from every other moment of our life. The main difference being, that our conditions were self
                imposed, via
                our interests and creativity, and the normal arrangment with your family, and the encumbent, and
                generally
                seen, foresight of our future success and oblige. Our current moment is merely brining things to
                light, so
                that our stability is born from us, and thus held by our amends. Nor, compared to the scorn and
                weariness of
                dependance, we may rightly and fully address our life and ways. This is no poor matter, and as so,
                we may
                clearlyattend.
                <br>&emsp;For starters, we are always conditioned. And our sense that something is wrong, stems from
                the
                fact that our place in such condition is either unappreciated, or immature. As all, in slavery or
                kingship,
                naturally instatiate themselves to their position; whereby the trouble of it becomes adapted to, as
                do their
                strenghts rise over the weight of the request; nor do the rewards stay flat, as your mere prescence
                tends to
                bring more reward, if not familiarity and the according satisfaction. Nor, in the things beyond this
                post,
                where our postive concerns are drawn, are we so blinded and or hampered to such sights, and by that,
                witheld
                to attend. "And there lies hope, to which this calm sea, in all its tides and ripples, elevates the
                basiclevel."
                <br>&emsp;In this way, I am grappling with the objects which my unadorned mind seeks; and whether
                such
                things ought guide me, and thus become our ends in sight. For such matters, in all the prescence,
                tend to
                linger infront us when we have stopped; but our sight of them prior was one that was at that point
                ahead; as
                in our fuller strides, we naturally saw the road ahead, and where our heart was taking us. Indeed,
                these
                moments held objects of mere sentiment, in that a future of sacrifice and contribution were gleemed.
                Only,
                now as our ordinary way has halted, or at least settled, into moments of indolence or rest, so are
                we
                without a clear horizon: in decleration or senitment.
                <br>&emsp;My feeling remains though, that the latter notion is one that marks the proper form of
                things. For
                our remarks of the former bring with them a sort of grasping breathe, as the nature of our indolence
                suggests. And so I heed these not, for the objects deemed are so, and in that esteemed, 'by our
                halted
                state'. And the according feeling that we ought, and pleasingly so, amend, is not so fair or valid,
                in that
                such ends are concieved and validated by our own lacking: rather than a relation born from solid
                grounds,
                and thus clear sight. "Were reaching in one, and merely open to the other. As if we are trying to
                come back
                to the world, whereby we strike a thin line; to which entry point holds the only insight to the
                world we
                see. While our other way, sees us already near and dear to the world, in all her grace and entirety.
                And
                happily, we see ourselves striding towards cleaningup."

                I am a little to idle to say much more than the purest remark. Which is, I have no desire for
                children. Nor
                do I recognize much interest in me, besides a sentiment of dreams and or conjuration (as to
                anticapte). I
                will admitt that during I finer strides, which are not so constant as to be solid until a discrete
                change,
                that within the dips and tides of such finer periods (we'll say), so do I recognize there a heartier
                view of
                such ends. In all fairness, this sentiment only occurs as a sort of validation, and or assurance as
                to
                something ahead. The difference being in times of more hollow moments during our better days, and
                the wholer
                future I see, and what I see during our truly idle times: whereby all but the suns light gleams so
                harsh
                upon me, that regards for a child are the next best thing to planning on reaching themoon.
                <br>&emsp;In any case, my solice here is one that permitts recogniton of that natural course. But it
                is not
                a course which I am thrilled to be on, or at any rate, meet. And although these recent days have
                shown me
                the fair exepectaion of such ends, and the good in sturdying our course for such, I still see that
                most of
                what I seek is not so ingrained to such acceptence, but rather the motions of art and leisure, and
                by that,
                the according dreams and futility.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, as those latter swellings have whithered off, so have we felt a little bare in our
                purities. Which is to say, that amidst our purities, in their whole and hearty ways, there lies a
                man
                content with such, and by that, without much care or contention around him. Time has shown her way
                though,
                and brought me to a understandble rebuke, in that, for ends I seek -and the according fancy- or
                those which
                have some regard for what is likely, and if not tradiotnally (and as much common), that so ought I
                be better
                in my amends; for so much of our time is spent living privately, or at least enclosed. And for some
                time
                this served our aim of improvment. But as those years have worn off, and we are now at most
                remembering the
                good in being as we improved, so am I left with the honest remark that our inconstancy is born, by
                choices
                that have made us ill-equiped or fit for such being.
                <br>&emsp;My point overall comes from this, in that, of children, or contribution, so do these lay
                as
                laudible points of that improved path. But as things, and our view of them, so are they gleamed from
                the
                stance of such being. And such a stance, in all honesty, sees with it a need to settle into our rich
                and
                gradual path. One of which, in all fairness, sees where we are lacking in terms of those natural
                ends. For
                however likely, we may have little sense or idea about how to approach them. That we'd reach them,
                and
                strive for them at that, is not something which needs change. But for such important deeds, as would
                become
                of such ends, so doth our potential occurence with them reveal the quality of our view and
                understanding of
                them.

                For most my life I've been obsinate. The only time I was ever free was when I was running around,
                playing
                with myfriends.
                <br>&emsp;I never knew many girls, and seldom would they run with us.
                <br>&emsp;Our life was never an issue this way, as we were solid, tough, strong. Indeed, we often
                got into
                trouble. But welearned.
                <br>&emsp;What I can remember though, is that upon our youthful age, life became somewhat tilted,
                setting
                onto a point which was not so much about satisfaction and joy, but comfort and fun. We were no
                longer
                running around, seeking the mere prescence of friends. But rather hanging out, and at that,
                appearing
                places. I never liked this.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, our shift into youth saw us ingratitated to such a flow of life. But in all
                fairness,
                it was still of an age where all the tits and tats were done at school. Indeed, we would stay around
                after,
                and there were the inklings of hanging out later than that. But for the most part, not much had
                changed.
                When we shifted to fully into youth though, it was clear that we were in line with such matters in
                their
                fullest expression.
                <br>&emsp;In all honesty, the conduct of these ways was not so heavily attuned as my remarks may
                suggest.
                For the flair of things which I cared little for was centered around school, and not so much
                afterwards.
                That is, during recess for instance, there were kids who played soccer, or on the field at least,
                and those
                who stood near the school, in a huddle, full of girls and boys, puffing themselves up, chatting,
                rumouring
                around. I was so opposed to this. In comparison to the similar scenario the time prior, I was
                naturally at
                the heart of it. While in this circumstance --having switched schools-- we were near the outer ring.
                And
                sitting there, appearing present, was just stupidlyoff.
                <br>&emsp;For whatever reason, my entire youth was spent orbiting this arrangment. Only, my care for
                it was
                critical, and full of timid scrutiny. The idea of being so prevalent was something which had me
                blush, or at
                least shy away from. "And like someone young and in love, but embarrassed by it, 'I equally said
                such things
                were stupid'."
                <br>&emsp;In this way I isolated myself. For I did not change our path, and find other places to be,
                or
                people to be around. Or at any rate, as I have become in my current life, I did not finely amend to
                myself,
                and cultivate that. Which is to say, that in all the stupidity I saw around, I did not foster myself
                in our
                place outside of it, as to be a better version of myself in suchplace.
                <br>&emsp;I must remark though, that despite our aversion to group sentiment and mentality, I did
                have great
                friends. I recalll one who I had never met prior to beginning our highschool year, and he and I
                shared all
                our classes, and time together. And beyond that, whether I naturally settled in with my classmates,
                I always
                had a good friend or two. And surely one of them was the best, and one who I spent much of my time
                outside
                of school with. For some reason the interests we had at that age, playing games, eating food and
                staying up
                late, was not something I sought to share with a bundle of people. Especially when I was older, but
                so in
                general, this sort of experience felt diluted; either in the enjoyment I would get, as expressing
                myself
                felt so crowded out; or, the intent I had, or care for the things at hand, lost their focus and
                attention.
                And overall, I just never enjoyed 'hanging out', in that we'd just bro around, through jabs at
                eachother and
                what not. I always preferred the actual activity, be it soccer, a hike, a game, or a film. And for
                my whole
                life I have either gone where I could do so to a solitary degree, or with a small amount of folk, or
                mere
                friend, who would share said activitiy withme.
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, my life has been such, that circumstance has taken me away from what I know,
                and
                thus offered me only the easier task of mingling with groups of people; and not so much the longer
                task of
                making a dearer friend. Indeed, moving to Pitt Meadows did this; for depsite making good friends,
                our choice
                of highschool was detterred by our sentiment regarding the people I'd see myself going with. For
                that, I
                went somewhere other. And indeed, highschool felt even more pitched in its group mentality; beyond
                the
                little nooks of closer friends that is. But for whatever reason, our life was such, that of our view
                and
                course in life, so was it not inclined or appropriate to the norms around; and all the likely
                because the
                dreams and assurance we had, was built on finer cares and principles, rather than those of young
                flirty men.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, our natural path was so, that based on the prolonged stay at school, we
                naturally
                incorporated ourselves into more people; and at that, invited interests by others. Early in our
                years, this
                process highlighted our immaturity and ways. For in grade 9, two girls showed interest in me, one
                doing so
                with near explicity. And I shrugged it off, feeling either nervous, embarrassed, or afraid. Simply,
                my 'shy'
                critique of things, in the depths of me we'll say, manifested in this rerpoach from my parents:
                regarding
                girls in particular. And so despite feeling fine to be invovled with someone at school, I just felt
                so
                averse to their invovlement; so much so, that in that explicit case, I said no. "I reckon, that as I
                saw
                much of the puffiness and confidence of people around, that so was our contrast to that something
                which I
                felt my parent's exasterbated." For one the key marks, is that our aversion to getting invovled with
                someone
                was that it would bring us into the sight of others. In this case, the girl was of a prominent sort.
                And so
                my sentiment was that if we got invovled, I would either a) become situated in the tits and tats of
                all her
                friends, or b) feel strange and awkward at holding myself back, 'while she otherwise explains my
                oddities to
                them: making exucese for my lack ofincorporation'.
                <br>&emsp;In any case, this pace of life was brought to our crucial defeat. For life had whithered
                my down a
                little, in its wants and needs from me. So much so, that depsite our consistent lameness, we filled
                out a
                little, becoming more confident and 'socially tuned'. Yet, despite becoming naturally invovled with
                other
                people, I still did not have the bones to back it up. We found ourselves in a rich scenario, and a
                disagreement arose; we mispoke, and became seperated from the group. Directly and not, our closer
                relations,
                'of those we sat nearest at the group table', left my side also --out of vehemence or happen chance.
                And I
                was left all alone, mad, depressed; but also obstinate, and in such a way that I appointed myself to
                greater
                actions and success. "A sort of 'screw you' attiude; of such a fuel at least, whereby we were
                desperately
                motivated to dowell."

                So we've mentioend alpha 9 before, it being a colony out in the vastness of the Perseus. The planet
                is
                small, and without much vegetation. There is water, and by that, condensation; so that it rains, and
                snows.
                The tectonic activity has created mountains in the north, and great deserts in the south. Notably,
                they have
                massive purple hued crystals sticking out of them.
                <br>&emsp;One of the reasons that the northwest was chosen, particularly in the gratient flat, is
                that
                aestheically and suitbaly, the place delights. In the north, runs a belt of mountains; pearing out
                into the
                western sea, too the easter edge, where mount cushing lies. "And beyond that, there appears flat
                lands and
                litte islands dotting the eastern sea." The flat runs down from these mountains, and runs many miles
                south.
                Whereby the land begins to dip, 'to which the in the distance the crystal desert lies'.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the expidtion was banked on the richness of its inhabitants lives. Notably, so
                that
                they may stability and happily flourish, 'whereby their minds may be drawn and nourished, and
                prompted with
                a sense worth blinking back toearth'.
                <br>&emsp;That being so, the gratient flat was such, that room was held for several hundred people.
                Hoom was
                built with state of the art technology, namely a reproductive line of machinery, whereby offspring
                could be
                produced. "Indeed the matter of children reamins an unclear matter." At any rate, the aim of the
                colony was
                to live well, and from there, have the lasting means to naturally and or unaturally persist; but all
                the
                likely exist initially in the greatest way.
                <br>&emsp;As such, the flat was choosen because of its relation to the mountains, the western sea
                and its
                beach, the relative height compared to lower flats in the east, and that in the south. Simply, it
                was an
                unremarkably flat area of land, near the ocean, with views of the mountains, and enough space to
                warrant
                such delights. One of the initial initiaivtes was to cultivate the land. Namely, in that via the
                prescence
                of water, and the resource machinery on Hoom, the 'soil' naturally found in the ground, could be
                made
                harvestable. "Indeed, much of the settlements layout, as remarks beatuy, service and production, has
                been
                written in the policiesbound."
                <br>&emsp;The heart of this story though, is that earth, in her mid century flair, is a little
                riged.
                Indeed, her modern style has grown out of the antiquate ways of the century prior. But still, she
                beckons to
                the past, in all the cracks and scarss which the annals have dealt. Her remarks are not seen as
                detrimental
                though, as in past expressions. Rather, she is merely stable, yet in a wobbly way. She still lacks a
                purpose, an aim, some sense of how she'll forever be. Her subjects are of a fair sort, in that the
                barbarity
                and pundancy they embellished has but a lingering claim. But of those nearly modern, or variedly
                natural, so
                are they few and far between. Admittedly, all have the bones of this, and are not such of the
                characters
                millenai prior. But of something defined and elegant, so in the richness of peace and happiness,
                they are
                not. "They are but a bit more humble, a bit less clad, nor bigoted. Nor are they as mundane in their
                freedoms, nor indulgrent. There just lacks something comparable to that which those primtiavely
                espused; a
                certainty, some principle, a soldity of living which is both felicituous and moral." And of those on
                alpha
                9, alike those sent further about, so are they all set to enliven such ends, 'and beam back
                something which
                worthy of earth'sbound'.

                So I don't mean to degrade those I'm speaking for. For truly, my dissent of them is more a remark of
                my
                ill-fit for such ways; and of ways which are a mirror to certain virtues. "Being so shy, and
                proclaiming
                thing's I'm nervous about to be stupid, is no good remark ofme."
                <br>&emsp;But I will say, that for all it's worth, I have never ceased this commision to the good,
                and,
                through our youth, an aversion to all things I esteemed not as so. Indeed I took this overboard; at
                least my
                weakness' became backers to my judgement. But still, I maintain that the crux of those ways, in
                group
                interest and broader tradition, is not becoming of what I seek, or of what I find comparable to the
                experiences I find dear. "It is so, that our weakness', however present, were not so by pure
                foundation, but
                application: and our resolve was no pitched to be so prominent, due to the feeble ends Isaw."
                <br>&emsp;My aim here is not to critique. My adolescent has held nothing but that. Instead, I would
                simply
                remark that of this way, be it with merrit or some sourced preference, that our commisery with it
                was so,
                that when we were stout and sound in it (those group and tradiotional ways), that I was fine,
                excellent in
                fact, and quite proper in our strides. But as life goes on, and our truer weakness and immatruity
                come to
                sway, we loose such prominence, and erode to the outer edges. "Where were simply looking in." It is
                from
                here that my life has been formed. For indeed, family trauma has bent me, nor had my actions been
                rich in
                sense or solidity; and as such, we were naturally unkept or settled as to be so prominent in those
                taughty
                ways.
                <br>&emsp;Worth noting though, is that in all that time, and particularly as we were forced to grow
                up,
                there was never an ambition or sought return to such center. In it's entirety, this statement is not
                true,
                as there were motions that reflected such strides. But the intent was generally ill-founded. And an
                further
                sentiments of the sort were more akin to dreams and relief. "Whereby we had in fact become
                ourselves, and
                happily; but upon life's struggles and our trouble in being so, so did we conjure a destiny which
                remarked
                our greater selves, but to a glorious and generousdegree."

                So to return to our story, we had broken off with some friends, eventually found new ones, and bad
                habits at
                that. And as highschool came to a close, were seeped in the boutinless pit of romance and purpose;
                and our
                poor habits had more fuel, as well were our parentsdispleased.
                <br>&emsp;We reconciled this though and found a point of entry. We went to school in the following
                winter
                semester, to much acclaim and excitmenet. Only, I recall surely, that upon the mid-term exams, we
                were left
                feeling a little hollow and empty. Perhaps our poor efforts were not so rewarding, and thus our
                engagmenet
                was as solid as our effort was. But simply, without the novel motive of continuing to do well, the
                lack of
                purpose otherwise left me somewhat directionless and unconcerned about our school. The problem
                though, was
                that we were enrolled, and quite destined to find some place in life via this path. But of that I
                saw not.
                <br>&emsp;It was as if I gave way to my reserved and reckless self, but upon entering a better
                realm, saw no
                end in it, nor held any lasting enjoyment due to the applied nature of it. I firmly recall loving
                the
                initial half of the semester, as the lectures and post-secondary vibe just felt fun and meaningfull.
                But the
                second succcess was on the line, my immaturity and empty sight held me indismay.
                <br>&emsp;In the year prior some habits had pitched me into a rugged hell. And during that time I
                had
                expeirenced a weird hypocondria, where I thought I was dying. "Really just a mixture of destiny and
                dreams,
                and that of lonely bareness: by which my heart faintly whimpered." In this later stretch of the
                semester
                though, I began to consider suicide. Not literally, in that I sought out a means to it. Rather, as I
                reckon
                all would compare, that there was merely a hope for death, 'or rather a cease of our current spot'.
                I
                rememeber going to sleep one night, wishing I wouldn't wake up. That was the nature of our intent.
                Not so
                much that we would, but that our care to live was gone, and if we were here no longer, how good
                that'dbe.
                <br>&emsp;Things did even out though, as final exams occured, followed by a visit to the states. Our
                sentiments going in, and upon return, are not so clear, but I can say, as regards my habit, that I
                had
                become a little romantic about ceasing it, claiming 'todays the day, I quit'. And I recall
                proclaiming that
                right before I went on the trip; whereby I applied an almighty practice of binging on the soon to be
                rot
                substance, 'as if I would fill up my register, and satiate myself enough so that I could persist
                withotu
                doing it, indefinitely'. This worked as well as you'd imainge. For upon re-entry, I spent more time
                acting
                as I cared not to. And as the summer approach, I was sitting at my friends, in the monring in his
                backyard,
                and simply stated I was done. The whole time prior I had been exposed to such habits via certain
                friends.
                And in this time, those relations had become more distant; and thus my current plea was one that
                held not
                but me to say it. And my friend beside me was equally enamered, and pointedequally.
                <br>&emsp;I wont speak for him, but for me, I had pulled myself out of the hollow hole that my
                highschool
                finale had set me in. There was nothing solid I'd reached, but remaining from our attempted efforts
                was an
                esteem towards myself. I would have to reflect to really understand the specifics; but I can say,
                that this
                initial sense that I had to prove myself was gone; nor was there this lack of what I enjoyed, or
                cared about
                in life, to make me feel like efforts of the prior sort were needed. "I no longer felt I was in a
                hole.
                Merely standing at the edge of a meadow." For whichever reason, I pointed my efforts for the sake of
                that,
                of what I can only describe as my interests and propiety. Simply doing what seemed good in itself,
                and had
                me 'being' better, rather than progressing towards some end.
                <br>&emsp;On that day I quit, me and my friend went into his home. Similar to the bravado I had when
                quiting
                prior, 'when I had the flair and confidence that one similary has on new years, when they so
                hopefully
                resolve to change', that so was I equally elated and bent towards actions of an esteemed sort.
                Simply, we
                went on our computer and searched, 'ten healthiest foods'. Up came an article, showing Kale to have
                1,000 vitamin K, mussels to have 10,000 B12, and a few more of the sort. Something struck us about
                this, and initated a
                sentiment that has remained
                prevalent ever since. Being so inspired, we grabbed a bunch of flax, bananas and kale, and
                smoothie'd it up. Upon
                drinking it, we felt a little off about the flavor: but so did the point in our life changed. For
                despite the taste
                being a little rustic (and in retrospect, lacking of berries), we felt there was this strenght and
                assurance which camce
                from the quality of the food. We stood by it, reverred the good in it, and felt, akin to exercise,
                or that even of the
                esteemed career one should disipline themselves towards, that this item of ours was of pure worth,
                no matter the taste.
                "I might summarize this that we became ideal and disposed into taking our vitamins. And in that,
                became quite literate
                in the ways such things were espoused to benefit us. That they did is it's own matter. But of our
                efforts, we could at
                least prosper from our belief in them, and all the harmony which surroundedthat."

                To properly view the world, you have to recognize that it is on a global scale. And thus conflict
                and or
                depravity will be exhibited within that total realm. The very fact that we have an economy, means
                that the
                pace of our life will move towards and draw from markets. And by that, as all conflict is based on
                preservation, so will the shortcomings of that propell some to take what others have.
                <br>&emsp;By this, I cannot say I know what is right and wrong. For I don't submitt to much more
                than these
                mere happenings. And of those purer causes, so is it but a drip of time to mend things out. And
                indeed, all
                negative conception can be blunted by this sense. For even in moments of severity, ought this be
                shouldered
                by calmer moments leading in, and simpler moments following. "And we ought not accept the fallacy of
                thinking that this natural process of things is but a surrounding to an otherwise eradict event;
                rather, it
                too proceeds with common cause."
                <br>&emsp;In many ways, our core philosophy is that nothing occurs but through the annals of time.
                And
                generally all that occurs well, comes from inventions of sort; by which all can transition to use
                such
                advents, and propell the status of things to newer highs. But conflict and misfortune take time to
                accrue,
                and at that, are as equally swift in their progress.
                <br>&emsp;From this, we are left with the odd remark, in that, if we are free enough to see the
                annals
                ahead, then ought we sink into such liberty and provide the products born from that. Or ought we
                scower the
                land around, and see whether or not there are those worse off than us. "Those who are sat un less
                even
                grounds us; as remarks perhaps the time, the culture, lineage even. For we may be so well off
                because of our
                particular circumstance; rather than that which is provided to all by the general times and ways:
                some may
                not have so readily caughtup."
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, are furried threat is that of suggestion, and our vulernability from not being so
                progressively applied. Indeed, I don't feel that those who provoke such feelings do so with the aim
                of me
                being a rebel. In fact, I think they'd like me to see the way things are, as to contribute towards a
                lasting
                change. Regardless of the strenght in what they say, and whether it illuminates issues as I'd see,
                so are we
                comparable in aim, to wit, we both care for the propserity of people; and by that token, the
                development
                pasttradition.
                <br>&emsp;Our problem perhaps is that we don't live in a pasturized state, as to worry only about
                what is
                fair and relevant. Even if there were a war, and bombs were dropped, so wouldn't I know outside of a
                superficual degree. This indeed is a dear admission. For much of my contention with those who prompt
                such
                thinness, do so only to the effect of our fear of something happening at all. And all too much of
                our sense
                bears the weight of reproaching from the belief that something will happen at all. "It would be
                better to
                accept that it can, but that, of reality, ought the bones of that be as strong as our conceptions
                would
                benefit." Indeed, this is quite tough, for reason says that little of which is true is actually
                known. And
                so in our less than applied ways, we are no less ignorant or short of principle. Nevertheless, upon
                hearing
                words of reason, or the babblings of this and other, so is our 'senility' within our particular
                freedom
                tampered with. And we are left with this underlying fear that things are not as we'd mind. "Perhaps
                the
                world is not so large, and our mature view is not representative."
                <br>&emsp;Hereby our friction stands, to the effect, that of our balance between inputs which
                unsettle, so
                lies the counter of a sturdy understanding; wherein we are not simply with reproach, and humbly at
                ease
                outside of being provoked, but rather clear on things, and with a grip on them as our deeper
                sentiments
                reflect. To the effect that the complexion of our reproach is not merely a lauded haze, but a solid
                iron of
                which the obscurity of the world is known. "And not even the clearest debree of tradition or
                pundancy could
                penetratethat."
                <br>&emsp;Where I stand then is in a sort of memory. As if, in a ruffled stated, we recalled how the
                burning
                grief present in our mind was in fact not laudible, nor comparable to our past experience of a deep
                and
                tranquil mind. By that, I'd state that the mind is but an electrical response, with a mere obscurity
                to
                distribution. By that, lies the contention of being: but to us, nothing special lies. At any rate,
                even if
                we lived in a war torn country, the service required of us would be one of sacrifice; to which our
                triumph
                was in courage, rather than overcoming defeat. "Herein lies the hunting grounds for chimera's of
                pain of
                monstrosity."
                <br>&emsp;No matter, the fact remains that the world is relativley modern. And that, of those which
                we deem
                other, so are they so but in a novel way, rather than of the distinct sort in which our past
                relations
                reflected. We are all human; and despite the holes in our conduct, so is their a common union of
                aims and
                values; by which, in whole or parts, we share, support, and at the very least accept, the shared
                goal of
                love and prosperity. From this, I give much aceeptence to the fact that less a medely of nuclear
                bombs are
                dropped, that the world will persist. The effects of the climate, however progressed or developed,
                will be
                but novelly poor. "As our times are such, that the very matter of annihilation is a mark of us being
                civilized enough as not to seek that, that so would our lasting process into a warming world, see a
                resourcefull attempt to mitigate that: and at the very least treat its effects. To which we say, the
                result
                is but a degree of prominent perril." Robots sit 100 miles off of any reasonable regard; and surely,
                find
                themselves being seen with a even mind and confident eye.

                So this may be a fools errand, as I have an interest in forming our selves, as not to be so
                impressionable
                during our rest or idle periods. I recognize though that during those moments, I will still be
                subject to
                said impressions. But my thought, is that by strengthening our views of things, as not to be so hazy
                or
                orbiting around, that their clearness and nearness will bear me a natural posture; and thus a normal
                insolubility to sorbibsights.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, we are trying to learn of the world. Depth is one thing, but breadth is what I
                seek.
                Some things have a natural pairing with histroy, in population namely; or that of illness and death.
                But the
                reality is, that our efforts are pointed towards denominations and their resepctive proportions
                within a
                part of life. The rate of malaria in Africa, the suicide rate in Asia, the prevalance of aids in
                Europe, or
                the homicide rate in South America.
                <br>&emsp;That being said, it is important to note the weight we put on certain strata. For the
                earth as a
                whole is in reality a set of continents, and they nations. These however, are each split into
                regions,
                states, terriotries/holds, cities and districts --Eastside of NewYork compared to the Bronx. For our
                efforts, it makes sense to have a solid view of the larger pieces, and then specialzie in certain
                smaller
                parts. We may learn about the whole of Nigeria, the whole of China's southern region, the whole of
                Ontario,
                the whole of Miami, the whole of Compton. We will never know the whole of all these pieces. There is
                just
                too much. But we can find strenght at lower depth, comparable to what we have near the surface.
                <br>&emsp;At that, I'd describe our broader efforts as one which balance between continents and
                countries.
                For the matters of Asia are one thing, but those of India and China seem most prevalent. In that
                sense,
                Canada, the US and Mexico are a fair western batch, as is Brazil, Argentina and Urugay perhaps;
                along with
                Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa another; and Britain, Germany and France as the big European three.

                So it feels like we should be ourselves; but in that, be somewhat seperate, if not distinct, from
                our mother
                and father.
                <br>&emsp;It would seem preferable that we'd all co-exist. But if there isn't a shared view of
                things, or
                taste for what not, then the seriousness of this may lead to distance yourself. For I will always be
                near,
                if not around. But our actual invovlement, if beyond family matters, is spent together, is up
                forquestion.
                <br>&emsp;For my parents view the news. And idneed, without our own sect of ingestion, we are left a
                little
                thwarted by the very prescence of this; as if said source is something soul and entire, 'as in the
                governances of fables: to which the protaganist ignores'.
                <br>&emsp;In the comparison of church, there are many, and of varied divisions and orders; kinds
                even. By
                seeing that our parents view one line of things, so are we less grieved by the impression of such
                thing,
                'for it is merely one of many means of impression'.
                <br>&emsp;What I find though, is that I feel a little bare when we are so disposed to our view of
                things; if
                we are humouring this varied mix. But if I simply be, and not worry so much about our identity, then
                the
                prescence of the news becomes consuming. For it is not so that it is special in its impressions;
                rather,
                that by our cirucmstance, we are privy to it: for our parents watch it often through the day.
                <br>&emsp;I will state for the record, that our animosity is akin to a disturbance of peace. A state
                of
                which may not rightly be so; but no so for we lack which the disturbanced is in the form of; but
                rather our
                somewhat private and or unoccupied means of peace. In that, our identity is such as to receive less
                impression, as we are sold to another. But in this, we are less receptive to our family and fortune:
                for
                like impressions, we keep things out. And so I feel more confident, and longing, for a scenario
                which is
                faciliative to that: likely by our own means, rather than the generoisity of ourparents.
                <br>&emsp;It may simply be so, that our parents are inclined to watch the news. They may have very
                well been
                more mdoern, and watched podcasts, or been more delierate, and watched nothing at all. "At least,
                whatever
                they did watch, they were aware of it, and noted assuch."
                <br>&emsp;The trouble is that I cannot say anything. For it is essentially peverting our state in
                the
                family; nor, if we then moved out, or provided for ourself, would we so deeply care: or be privy to
                such
                disturbances.
                <br>&emsp;The reality though, is we are not asked to contend with what they see or feel regarding
                the news.
                Nor do we have to humour their fascination, or respect for those invovled. Words of the kind have
                never
                comeup.
                <br>&emsp;Where were left then, is in this comparable spot to one we've been in before; whereby we
                sit, a
                little uneased, but in a space which ought be alotgether full of it: for we are given all, and asked
                for
                not: yet still remain unfine, or at least susceptible to intrusion. Our little world is what's
                provided. But
                this get's tampered with from media and tv.
                <br>&emsp;I guess my resovle ought be, as reflects our encouragment to learn what we are otherwise
                in
                defense of, as contrasts those impressions which we deny, what it is we ought to do, or can do and
                would
                like, with respect to what we know. Which is in all, to say, that perhaps ideally their would be a
                different
                form to our gradual approach, in that the strenghts and weaknesses of it would be natural. But in
                this case,
                even if the weaknesses exposed are akin to that which gets shown upon vile consumption, that so may
                we
                attest to the thing discovered. And considering the principle defect shown, or insight gained, so
                may our
                resolve be equally based. "In that, upon learning who we truly are, may we amend to something truly
                worth
                doing: and how we deliberaytleybe."

                So I am not a solider, nor will I be one. I accept the conflict that others may find with those
                around them;
                but I am all too happy to accept any ones rule. Much aggression has occured due to self-defense. But
                personally, there is nothing I hold dear which can be taken from me: as all good is already mine.
                Indeed,
                one may coherce me to do something. But nothing which goes against what I already do. "I am not
                defending a
                belief agasint another, as I have nonealready."
                <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the unclaimed land of inquiry. Around this lies the smoldering
                flame of
                legend: namely, that of other peoples view ofthings.
                <br>&emsp;For there may be a war, and it may appear as if all are fixated on this. But there is, in
                reality,
                a grand assortment of people whos minds are somewhere else. Nor, is any event, so special when
                compared to
                the millions around. The world will simply moveon.
                <br>&emsp;I cannot always see this though. Indeed, my aversion to particular sources is that they
                flatten my
                view of things, and make bank of knowledge squishy. But the truth, is that without the sensibility
                which
                remarks what I have known, then so will I become engrained to the fixated sense: where I then fear
                and
                believe, that of a conflict there is exclusively so; and of others views, so are they but nearer to
                the soul
                thing of importance.
                <br>&emsp;My life then is odd. For the base of it comes down to our ignorance of tradition, and an
                otherwise
                state within a path uncompramised. From here, we've simply asked questions. Perhaps out of this
                dynamic,
                whereby we are left with nothing but which we have. And our family is perhaps so acceptably present,
                that
                there habits and views become enclosed around me, 'as that smoldering flame'. I never seem to escape
                this.
                In fact, those early days of self-embrace, and the cause of that, come from a similar process, in
                that our
                parents were not listened to: and so we found our other way. For having none felt hopeless and not.
                <br>&emsp;Where I have come to grow, is in the constance of this state, even if I was smoldered; and
                from
                there, drawn to restless rebuke, or rot relief. But I carried on; in some ways addressing the
                principle
                nature of this way, whereby I curried myself as not to be so vulnerable. But I never found anything
                else, in
                realtionships, meaning or friends. And so, the lingering heart of our mom and dad was so, that our
                shortcomings were immediately subject to their prescence. "One of which is moulded in sharp contrast
                to
                mine." Indeed, this state of constance has shown me, that of it polished shine, that this need not
                be
                sequestered, or imperfect. We may simply choose as to reflect the cheer in that way; and perhaps be
                invested
                and ordained enough, as not to notice the heat from those, who'd melt you when you've lost your
                ownflame

                So we have potential interviews coming up in a few weeks. If not, we have a more than likely
                approach to a
                march 1st move.
                <br>&emsp;For now, our health is in turmoil, as our lack of pushups and pullups has had me in a soft
                state;
                but our efforts to improve this have been toforceufull.
                <br>&emsp;I am more or less resolving to principle. Primarily, we are going to convert our attention
                to
                running, and use free range as a intermidary motion, and those pushups and accompanying exercises to
                broaden
                said running. Too much are we doing the latter without any foundatioanl respect: to which we become
                gritteddown.
                <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are morning, stabilitiy and rest. For that, there are practices and
                commonstrides.
                <br>&emsp;For one, we simply stand, fold, raise our arms over head, and potentially squat too. For
                stability, we mix runners lunge and lifts; with slight variations of warrior, leg raise and or
                bridge, quad
                stretch, and more emphasis on upward dog and planks. Attached to this are actual stretches; for I
                know too
                few besides pigeon pose; and so adding that to our stability seems fair. Rest centers around your
                shoulders
                and hips. Though, besides brief stetches, our shoulders having nothing more than the suttle recovery
                of our
                spine: for which they sit more gently. We may hug, cross, or bend, but this feels more dynamic than
                a merry
                hip opener or twist. Still, it is crossing our legs or arms which remark rest, then rinsing it off
                with
                baser poses --prone or supine.

                I can't speak to my life. And, fairly, I sit a little humble and unperturbed. This moment isn't a
                great one;
                but it is fine being so. For the days ahead are so stout and true, that in principle, theres not

                tosay.
                <br>&emsp;We are so free to be hired, that I cannot even care. We will work some amount, but the
                reason for
                it is good, as is there a moderate amount of joy, and otherwise benefit from doingso.
                <br>&emsp;As a spring, we are thus stable. And via our developed approach, may we see the future,
                and
                gradually reach it. Or, if we are more content and propped to be, or see things differently, then so
                may we
                reflect, and via letters, share. "Our view of children is mine. And is much more intended for you?

                So I have some feelings that are causing me grief. There's no problem, but my view of certain things
                feel
                unknown, and so I thought by merely sharing this, my aprpehension wouldcease.
                <br>&emsp;So I am writing this, not becuase there's some problem to be solved or thing to be changed
                Rather,
                I just have some feelings, and hiding them is causing me to feel contentious, but not warrentedly.
                So I
                thought that sharing them would remedythis.
                <br>&emsp;First, I do not like the news. It does not speak to me, nor does it reflect how I see the
                world,
                and by that, how I desire and fear things. I simply don't identify with it. It is not a resource
                which I
                admire, or find pleasure engaging with. I've felt this way for a long time, and it is the key
                example of a
                feeling which makes something into a problem, only because it is unheard. Nothing need change. I
                just wanted
                you toknow.
                <br>&emsp;///Ever since I moved up to Kamloops, and to this day, I have felt off because of this, as
                every
                morning and night, the news is on one of our tvs. To me, my ignorance is not measuredd by whether I
                watch
                the news or not. The world is larger and more mundane than anything it provokes. Which is indeed my
                biggest
                grievence with it, that it provokes me, to feel sympathy and frustration. I find no pleasure in
                this, and in
                my personal time, I avoid such things --in terms of my time and youtube etc.//// I am not asking
                anything to
                change. But as I said, not sharing my feeling leads to unfair judgement and resentment, and I'd
                rather it be
                known how I feel, then be full of irritation and scorn. I simply don't care forit.
                <br>&emsp;Secondly, is the course of my life. To squash this pretense that 'my oddities are an
                inhibitor to
                things', I would say, conversely, that my lack of friends, career and romance are not so because
                I've made
                myself uneligble. It's simply because of the choices I made. Prior to leaving Vancouver, I was well
                sat at
                work, in friends and potential romance. I don't expect that this cannot return. In term's of work, I
                see the
                promise (as mom suggested) in getting a certifacte in IT. I cannot say this is my prferred job
                though, as it
                would surely be from home, and right now, I care more to be around people, and work on my feet. It
                is a good
                option, and there are much more like it, but it is not in my current sights. It is something I can
                progress
                towards, and develop my baser means of income, but when I think of what I'd really like to do, for
                interests
                sake, I'd like to make a TikTok channel, making little quotes and phrases made from my writing. It
                has to be
                a buisness though, as the consistency required cannot be approached casually, nor
                withoutpreperation.
                <br>&emsp;Neither of these mean that the other can't be pursued, but they'll each find theirtime.
                <br>&emsp;I feel drawn to do this, but I'm being realistic about how much it takes, and what I'm
                willing to
                do right now. I don't see this interfering with more standard work, but one is but a development
                past
                working basic labor, while the other is about something I'd truly care for. Each will find
                theirtime.
                <br>&emsp;Thirdly, is chidlren. Say what you will of my life, where it's lacking, where it could be,
                but I
                contend, that the only thing I have to anwser to, in terms of some requirment in life ahead, is
                children. I
                can say, that naturally, I'll have one. I say this happily, and with understanding of what it needs.
                Having
                given this some thought prior, I can say that I'd only want 1. That, and I see myself doing so when
                I am
                ready to make it my primary happiness and responsability. Currently, theres an abudnacne of things I
                otherwise care for, and am driven towards. So beyond my means to having a kid, I don't have much
                desire for
                one, now at least. And as for a relationship which would precede this, I have no fear or worry about
                that.
                My oddities, upon thought, are not any concenr, or something I can't adjust.
                <br>&emsp;All in all, my only cares are to write, read and study, play games, watch youtube, be
                healthy and
                relish the outdoors. This is satisfactory on my own; and I can surely invovle more people in this.
                Even if
                there are none who I connect with on said basis, there are still other things I can do to be more
                social, or
                balance out my life elsewhere. These cares of mine feed off my ability to engage with them, which is
                the
                reason I care about being healthy: as the more I am, the more I can thrown myself in. And the moral
                of my
                life has been, that these things need not be sacrificed in order to pursue/have other things. You
                merely add
                tothem.
                <br>&emsp;Those are my feelings, such is my way. If I can live accordinfly, than I am happy to be
                home, and
                benefit byit.
                <br>&emsp;--to even out the rest of my life.
                <br>&emsp;These are my dearest cares. When I am unhealthy and flattened by junk, they feel far away.
                I ought
                not be so frugal for the sake of these, at the expense of friends and all other things. But
                considering that
                those can be fit into my life, so am I unapolegtic for being as good as my happiness from those
                other things
                can beenfit from.

                    <div class="text-body">So I question whether our view of things is as solid as we believe. For one, we are
                        not
                        in the scenarios which appear to us on tv. Nor does it truly represent what it is like to be there.
                        Indeed,
                        we can imagine what it is like, but therein lies the issue. Whereas reading impresses you calmy and
                        fully, I
                        find that visual inputs are saturating, and blend little with what I already know, with any conserved
                        proportions. And indeed, my deepest aversion to such mediums is how they distort my sizeable view of the
                        world, and instead mix it all up, to where it feels chaotic and small. "As if those suffering were right
                        over there; or threats upon me, were right at my door." This runs against the scope of the world. And
                        indeed, despite the loose depiction which we get; or at the very least a simplified view, as if we take
                        for
                        granted that everything visual encapsulates all the many happenings around, so are we left far abroad,
                        likely fortunate, be it of the country were in, or our particlar home. And from there, it seems that we
                        are
                        not but interested, in awe, and perhaps gripped by the narrative of it all: in how bad some have it, and
                        how
                        bad some produce. This is but a glancing contribution though; and I would say, that it is not those so
                        keen
                        to watch from abroad which hold the key to aid, but those in the communities near the incident. This is
                        a
                        deep mark against visual formatts, for they glimmer so brightly at us, that we sometimes forget that
                        what
                        their showing us is a world away; and that many governments and peoples lie between us and that. Is our
                        passive interest during the 6:00 news really helping? I would say, that there are ways to help. But
                        these
                        seem almost eclusivley relevant to direct action, rather than our mere emotional invovlement. Of that I
                        am
                        unsure, for none of it seems to center around anything other than education. There may be other avenues,
                        but
                        they seem centered on spreading senitment; which, albeit suspect for shallow grounds, still appeals to
                        the
                        heart of the matter, and in an outstanding way. There is surely room for both. If your not doing that
                        though, then I don't feel like your earning anything more than a coloring of your worldview, and by
                        that, a
                        tipped balance of your own life and propserity. By all accounts, a view of the world which holds history
                        and
                        breadth in regard, is not likely drawn to matters of those entire continents away. Our actions are quite
                        unoticible to those a province over; or a town even. I scorn not at those who shout with sentiment, or
                        try
                        and educate those about the matter. But those recieving ought do so with propiety, 'as not to be moulded
                        by
                        headlines and glamour'. Were looking for education, not wonder.
                        <br>&emsp;I guess my point, is that if your not going to produce anything meaningfull, then why feed off
                        of
                        those who do so, but in a way that is unfitting for a truly deep and enrichened view? Learning is of
                        interest beyond conquest; but of that, your liberty lies. And why, in all your freedom, to be merely
                        keen,
                        would you settle? Personally, I see the visual format as more accessible, and the programming nature to
                        be
                        excitable. "I am so frustrated though, because I angle my interests differently, towards an end which
                        actually treats my care to know things, not what is merely appealing. Such things, as I've found, are
                        akin
                        to fast-food, in that they are filling, but not in a wholesome or abundant way."

                        So mom and dad, and surely Jess, are not out to get you. They demand very little of you. But they
                        indeed, do
                        not hunour, or at least aid, our natural happiness; nor the form it takes.
                        <br>&emsp;We are unsure of things, necessarily, but via circumstance too. We do not know about work,
                        about
                        living here, what our harmony with that means for the future. And life's mystery avails us here too.
                        Generally, this centers on the chimeras of violence and revolt, but also our positive decree, of
                        uniformity
                        and fecundity. We know not where this road goes, nor if the bumps were filling are from the ground or
                        uneven
                        shoes.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel like a stranger in my own home. No one has the faintest idea of what cheer and
                        flourishing
                        great activity brings; and how nutered this is from poor choices; or a lack of good ones. Their surprise
                        and
                        sketicism is not appreciated. As if anything they did was understood on some basic level, besides a
                        norm;
                        yet, I am only ever asked the most unfamiliar question, 'as if eating Broccoli or working out was a good
                        thing....like how?'.
                        <br>&emsp;Those shoes of ours show themselves, almost clearly when under pressure, how unset they are,
                        and
                        the road, whihc, from our sight and prior view, is not so bumpy in character. Yet, it is rough, and
                        demanding of attention; and apt to bring wear and control: as all pursuits and itineraries do. Our
                        uncertainty of which part of the path we'll take,and the evdient preview of this, to which our feet have
                        not
                        hit earth and steadied forth, explains our current wear.

                        The matter of positive and negative regard defines our life. For whichever reason, we are left somewhat
                        elated, at the postive prospect of being at home, freely employed and rightly so, and thereby with our
                        family, propped for the sun and her darling scene; nor the lackings of food, equipment and fun. We can
                        live
                        here, just as we may live elsewhere.
                        <br>&emsp;The negativity though comes from some sort of reason; as if something is pressuring you, an
                        ailment as it were. And indeed, much of our strife comes from the frustration that others dimiss said
                        issues. Though, it is perhaps we who are ill-sighted, and have far too long been in such a decrepid
                        state.
                        Indeed, life fits is with such trauma, and naturally, so are we but responding to the ticks and tacks
                        gotten
                        along the way. This is for us to enlighten our soul though: for upon near reflection, we are not in fact

                        drug, but rather set to be, merrily, proper, and good as so.

                        So, prior to leaving Kamloops, we were in a solid routine, generally. We were exercising, not eating
                        sugar,
                        our sleep was well. Comapred to now, we were not running, nor doing much recovery. Our workouots were
                        not
                        too consistent, though we were fairly constant in our free range.
                        <br>&emsp;As we've moved though, and aided Jessica in here move, we've lost a great deal of momentum. To
                        the
                        point, where our workouts are either absent, or done forecfully, to a fairly negative degree. The perril
                        is
                        in our hips, in that we sit too narrow while trying to be upright, and this causes a lordosis in our mid
                        back; to which our shoulders come together, but in a shrug. This is killing our neck. Normally it does
                        not,
                        but we have no fair means to do pushups, or squats even; and so we beckon at the effect of not working
                        out,
                        or push through that poor posture.
                        <br>&emsp;In principle, we should do what is right for now. Despite recognizing our lack, we still are
                        best
                        to do things well. I think, foremost, we could diversify our stable motions. This does not mean we'd
                        practice, but akin to a forward fold, simply do more movements in a common way. Low lunge side twist
                        plus
                        quad stretch has been a great advent of this. There is room to do more volume when it comes to lifts,
                        and
                        perhaps warrior, but when it comes to leg raise, bridge, squating, ought we do it as if it were some
                        indispenisible stretch. Include it with a forward fold, or arm raise, and you'll be more open through
                        the
                        day. For now, we ought return to our strenght, and let the running we've done sink in, all while the
                        retain
                        our mould through stability, and our common poses.
                        <br>&emsp;Food wise were best to eat a fair amount. It is required that you wake up early. No more
                        waking up
                        past 9. If your alarm isn't working, get a new one. It derails us to wake up so late. Our veggies,
                        orange,
                        dried fruit and milk are perfect for the first half of our day. Indeed, I am not so clear or directed as
                        to
                        what our evening should be, or where and how it should be transitioned too. It is indeed a result of our
                        ineptitude as regards money. For we might be best to get corn, edamame, tuna, and otherwise lean on
                        quinoa,
                        as opposed to potatoes, rice and bread. These are not always welcomed. I would not forget, that much of
                        your
                        weightloss comes from not eating enough, rather than eating fully, but to ineffective degree.
                        <br>&emsp;We need seeds, oranges, soft bread, quinoa and milk, along with dried fruit.

                        The reality of my life is that little is required. Even this anxious pretense of children is not ripe
                        for
                        trouble, as frugal living levels out all needs.
                        <br>&emsp;My querry though is along the lines of positivity, and what this is afforded by. For I do see
                        that
                        stability is needed, so that we may live and rest securely. But in that, is there any quality which one
                        place is damned to lack? I do see varied complexions and nodes of interaction, but all in all, each
                        place is
                        the same. We work, live, rest, and around that, invest, learn, connect and grow. If we can do this well
                        in
                        one home, we can in another. And even if certain grooves are found only in certain spots, so does this
                        not
                        change the steadyness of our hand: or the rocky bounds that each spot holds.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I am remissed to say that more work may be required, if only because any on offer
                        demands
                        at least that much. This is a nice predicament; as we may verily be in a compramised spot, where ease is
                        found through shortcuts. In any case, I do expect that our demands will lighten, in volume surely. In
                        quality, so may the times not prevail. But so is there promise around.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in coming up with reaons to be, as if we would be free. For I do not
                        imagine
                        that our baser conditions will detach. Though, I can't say there's any grievence about this, as little
                        of
                        what I'd consider natrually required is either contrary or run down by our demands. It is moreso about
                        the
                        ration of work and living: and seeing that of what I might expect, that theres more of the former than
                        I'd
                        prefer, or desire.
                        <br>&emsp;It just seems like the color of the morn, the grazing of literature and the world, or the mere
                        cheer of gaming and fun, is enough for me to at least be ordinarly, but in a flourishing manner. Of our
                        broader purpose and place, I cannot say. But these things are not at heart to do with horiztonal growth,
                        towards presumed goods abound. We are still left with the balance of work and living. Our intent though,
                        or
                        meaning, may not come about but through our pleasant pace and peace, to which I am happy to find.
                        <br>&emsp;It's just not very clear what to do. For the past and her wares has me somewhat beholden,'like
                        mud
                        on my shirt', to the sentiments and or edges of our time. This is holding less interest in me, nor much
                        reason upon reflection. For instance, the difference of location is not so special, for all places are
                        almost equally esteemed in the good they offer. "Ten pounds of chocolate or vanilla still makes for a
                        heap
                        of ice-cream." Furthermore, the time of year is holding less of that bookended chain. For the winters
                        hold a
                        bare complexion, but vibrance too. Nor is the fresh air something to be averse to. Moreover, there is
                        not
                        much thought in me that says, 'we only mean to be somewhere for a short while, so we must go where we
                        wish
                        within a certain time, otherwise we'll miss the sweetspot of it'. This simply isn't so. There's no need
                        to
                        be anywhere but where you are: where time has brought you, and for all things good, you have formed
                        yourself
                        to be. Change may occur, but frett not. Our time allows for all, nor ought we remark much but the good
                        we
                        see: rather than the wish for more. And at any rate, the reality of all future concern, is to do with
                        things
                        of a broader sort. And indeed, I may only see a hill of riches infront; and by our admittedly uneven
                        grounds, may not see much further. But life will have moved on and caught up upon reaching said point:
                        to
                        where our measure of good is more, and beyond. And as we said, in terms of things far and about, so will
                        this come into clarity and interest by our flourishing way. "And that is about the best one could hope
                        for."

                        us.
                        Indeed, this proposition is perhaps flawed, as the requisite that we eat and sleep assigns us a
                        neccessary
                        mean to achieve such. So we'd properly say, that given food and a place to rest, so would we not have to
                        work. We may lack the common means for fun, but so may we gaze at the world and delight.
                        <br>&emsp;The point being that, for the fact that such things are provided, and the good which we'd
                        recieve
                        if they were, means that something is given up for the sake of said provision. And indeed this seems the
                        fashion the course for employment; in that, the work required is not so much a negative, but rather an
                        intrusion to positivity. "For indeed, the actual return of such work comes into qeustion: for if I got
                        twice
                        as much, I would at least have more good to purchase. While those who earn little, have little but their
                        needs met, and not much more: making the obligation a chore, rather than a happy mean."
                        <br>&emsp;Conversenly, to state the terms, being given such provision removes your ability to see ahead,
                        or
                        be so free in your strides. For dependance holds no sure end, even if it were a dreaded one. Nor, in the
                        case of family, where judgement is given, is rest easy to achieve: for you are not saxrifcing anything,
                        and
                        thus deserving of a break. But as such, as the worth of dependance is in the abscence of work, that so
                        are
                        you not happy without using your free time for such. Indeed, this is not hard to do, despite the
                        insecurity
                        of how long you may do so. But sustaining this is hard when rest is hard to sink into: as your free time
                        is
                        not esteemed as work, despite the effort invovled. Balance is thus hard to achieve, consistently
                        -without
                        ware.
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, I see that our life is full of positivity, and the minor amount of worked
                        required to
                        be stable, will not cause much interference. In fact, despite the volume of our time being spent on said
                        work, there is the benefit from the actual work, in that it is not as concentrated as your creative
                        efforts.
                        Plus, it is usually around other people. Beyond the balance of exchange, there still lies the preferred
                        lock
                        on your contuinuity. For it is better to earn a bit less, but increase your stock, then to have alot,
                        but
                        whither it away. "For the end is one of loss." As it were, the benefit here is one that magnifies all
                        other
                        goods; and over time, leverages itself into fuller forms, as to increase the magnitude of our living.

                        So I'm thinking that if were going to stay here, that we work at Superstore. It is close, and this melds
                        with an unbridled view of being here. There's no room for pretense. We may consider our future, as
                        regards
                        buisness, contribution or rearing. But so is this in need of clarity, and as such, living well produces
                        thus. So we need not be anywhere particular for said times to come in line. Besides that, we are merely
                        swell and pure: and this need not bank on any one localle: and can grow and adapt as well in all spots,
                        present or to come.
                        <br>&emsp;In that way, I see a similar prospect in East or West walmart. I feel there is more room to
                        negotiate, and so surely, we can achieve that marbled 2 day per week routine. Perhaps, an arrangment of
                        shorter shifts.
                        <br>&emsp;Let's say though that none of the three are hiring. We may choose to leave, be asked to, or
                        stay
                        for the nearer prospects ahead, or something freerer and indefinite.
                        <br>&emsp;What I would proclaim, is that living unstabiliy holds a blurred view of the future; as you
                        cannot
                        remark upon it with clear desire or ability. As such, you settle into the gradual paces of your day, or
                        idealize some broader end --as to carry you out. The struggle in this, is that living so gradually
                        wobbles
                        at the intolerance of doing so; and so rest becomes a parched resource: as you may live fully and truly,
                        as
                        you are both composed and definite in your striding state: but so upon the need for rest, do you crumble
                        and
                        despair: yielding an all to common ware.
                        <br>&emsp;Compared to this, the benefit of work, or stability rather, is that you are secure in your
                        means
                        and your further direction. This brings with it the balance of labor and liberty: but so does such
                        things
                        have their own principle measures. At any rate, the advantage of being so set, is not itself a divine
                        privalage, or one of scorching neccessity. It is perhaps right, but not exlusivley. Our gradual ways,
                        which
                        is to say those which are less ideal or worn, but more ripe and solid instead, do produce such future
                        remarks. Indeed, they are not hoistered by the sentiments which stability brings, and therefore lack as
                        much
                        focus or actionable regard: but they do linger between the bounds of this, and by that, hold much
                        concerns
                        for farther ideals, and those comparable but of a nearer sort.

                        So rice, barley, lentils and potatoes are a given.
                        <br>&emsp;Oranges are around 3-4$ for 6, so likely less than 5 for 7. Similar to tofu or other one off
                        things, you may buy several more for a days worth, but this does not define the price.
                        <br>&emsp;Kale is 2$ and lasts some time. It's so good, and its more likely, besides soups, that if you
                        boughht 3, you'd have plenty for 2 weeks.
                        <br>&emsp;Bread is an oddity, as you generally have soft bread, which runs about 5 servings for 4$, or
                        english muffins, which have 3 servings for 2$.
                        <br>&emsp;Dried fruit is relatively inexpensive, but must be refilled often for the benefit to stay.
                        Dates
                        come and go, and their price is more limited by the breadth of selection. Whle cranberries are quite
                        clear,
                        in that the low sugar ones are 2.5$ on sale (often). I tend to afford 2 packs a week, though it is
                        likely
                        that you'd have 1 or 2 less for the month.
                        <br>&emsp;Popcorn is not an incidental expense like a potato, as you must pay about 5$ for a pack of 12.
                        You
                        may buy smaller, and accomodate a less than constant use. But the value is there. Though, Orville is
                        more
                        expensive.
                        <br>&emsp;Milk is the grand puba of economic understanding. For you drink it to get calcium and B12. You
                        may
                        supplement elsewhere, but generally, such vitamins are about 10-15$ for a 3 month supply. Calcium is had
                        amply through milk, and B12 is techincally only half way served. Vitamin D is almost not served, as is
                        Iodine a technical abscence. At any rate, a 2l jug of oat or soy milk runs 4$. It may be 5, but it is
                        often
                        closer to 4. And indeed there are sales, and bulk prospects. Because calcium and the filling for the
                        midday
                        is the milks purpose, you tend to get 8-10 servings per jug. I'd still average 4 per month. And if some
                        expense could be procurred, I'd say, while avoiding sugar, that having more than one serving per day
                        would
                        be nutritionally, practically, and satiably beneficial.
                        <br>&emsp;Similar to this is edamame, which tends not to be too expensive, coming in at about 2$ for two
                        servings, or about 3-4$ for a several serving bag. These are had off and on, so buying a single pack for
                        2
                        servings may suffice.
                        <br>&emsp;Quinoa is similar to milk, in that upon any excess beyond the essentials, so is this first to
                        be
                        incorporated. As it's protein content in tangent with it's nature as a grain, makes it a rich
                        supplemeent
                        and or compliment to your baser grains. You may buy 1kg for 6$, which does last a week. Or you may buy a
                        larger bulk bag for a comparable price ratio. "The price of pure bulk is not known."
                        <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are the buzzing's of snacks and junk, all tending to be a couple to 5 dollars
                        for
                        a serving or two. Chips for instance, run about 4$ for two servings, as do veggie dumplings run a
                        similar
                        price. Samosas compare though may be more expensive depending on the kind.
                        <br>&emsp;As a techincal aside, bread is split into soft and muffins. The former ranges from 3-5, the
                        latter
                        a pure 2. Seems laudible at 5$ per week.
                        <br>&emsp;The big one, is grains. Rice is 3$ for 2kg, which is a large amount. Barley is 2$ per lb,
                        though
                        this can be lowered with bulk ---and you do not eat as much in terms of volume. Lentils are quite cheap,
                        coming in at 1kg for 3$, and the value in that is unmatched. It seems laudible that rice is a one off,
                        lentisl come every 2 weeks, and barley is a main, with 2 bags likely sufficing per week.

                        // January 27th
                        <br>&emsp;I'm definitely at dis-ease. Speaking to Dev is a sort of authorative submission, as I have
                        this
                        idea that he's unpleased to see me. This is not entirely true. Indeed, if I fell into this fear, and
                        spoke
                        to him inappropriately, then that would be something I brought on my self. But it has been time, and we
                        are
                        not at all being excessive. We simply phone and check in. He may say yes or he may say no. And truly,
                        there
                        is much room for both. Walmarts are there, but ideally, we'd work at Superstore, two days a week. The
                        schedule may be off, but surely we can bring it up once employed. I am fretting though whether or not to
                        bring this up; as I fear that saying we want few hours makes me unappealling. Walmart feels more
                        approachable in this manner. The stakes in all of this are small, as I have no choice to leave, and by
                        that,
                        am at least properly headed.

                        It is worth reflecting on the single shift routine. As such a spot on your otherwise empty calender, can
                        produce more of a friction, as it seems so startingly different from your free time.
                        <br>&emsp;Unlike this is the two shift state, as even a back to back creates a meaningfull invovlment:
                        as if
                        it were a stronger fulcrum. Or, with some favor, each may be spread out, and you work one here, another
                        there, with breaks in between. This is the best actually; and supercedes the single shift, whose rate is
                        simply to low compared to the smaller breaks between two shifts.
                        <br>&emsp;Three shifts is a bit trickier, but upon reflection, isn't so damning. Like two shifts, the
                        rate
                        is denser, and thus you can appreciate your activity in it, along with the surrounding free time. Where
                        three shifts weighs on you though is in the blockier matter, where you more than likely have a larger
                        back
                        to back node, followed by a single. This is fine, and ought not be dreaded; but truly, such a state
                        holds
                        more prevalence to work, as that blocky node draws much address. While the double is merely a solid
                        block
                        with a large gap in between, or a fair spread of breaks between smaller nodes. This refelcts the peace
                        from
                        half shifts, as they draw little regard or fatigue. Single shifts always produce this in general. But
                        even a
                        single that sees a block ahead is more weighing, as you cannot repreive into the single ease, with that

                        Lifes broader remarks draw me to both hopefully and fairly anend. It is near obvious to me that our care
                        for
                        the former comes from feelings and or regards born from our distant self: whereby the natural unease and
                        shiftness bring with it aims and concerns correspondant to it. While our stronger sides, which writing
                        tends
                        to bring out, hold more solid bounties. Though, without the promises of our mind, there may not be
                        something
                        so definite to attend. The honest remark then, is that of that which prodds at us now, ought we reflect
                        and
                        attend to this, in and of it self. For it is one thing to be balanced, but unsure of life's greater
                        ways.
                        And another to be so unbalanced, but by such uneveness amend.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am left then is with the solem remark that our public aims are neither ill sought, but
                        not
                        so steady, in origin or interest. "It is our duty to ourselves though, to be stable enough, as our near
                        efforts and choices are concerned, to be set and ready to see things, and of them, renark. For we are
                        left
                        otherwise bowing ourselves to false imagery and concepts: all bridled by the illusions dangled by the
                        future. And, as said, learning about yourself and the world, and properly tieing the two together as to,
                        in
                        the extent that you are so broadly concerned, amend, is so, that being as to cultivate and harvest such
                        sense, holds the line of right, as to do with you."

                        acquaint myself with the circumstances, as to bear any weight, and through habit iron it out; and

                        I think back, and Simron was the only person I'd give myself to. I felt no nerves around her, as I had
                        no
                        fear of hiding. I was able to be what was required for her: for of her I saw, and felt somehow, she saw
                        me.
                        <br>&emsp;This was so for I felt she was a good person. Someone who followed the rules, not out of fear
                        or
                        pride, but because it was fair and decent. I knew this, because when I messed up, she would laugh at me,
                        as
                        if we were supposed to be doing it well, and it was merely the course of such wellness, that it was not
                        hard, but natural: and so worht a laugh when you messed up: for she was already disposed to such a line,
                        and
                        all things out of norm were not so damning: as she was not held there by fear or pride.

                        When I think of work, I see two sides: time and volume. For one, you may not be able to work weekends,
                        or
                        afternoons. For this I can say any works. For the other, this amounts to the extend of your involvment.
                        For
                        whatever way you may or not work, so is there an amount to such involvment. We are not looking for full
                        time, nor can we do four shifts regularly. I can adapt, but despite being able to do three per week, two
                        is
                        prefereable, and in fact all I'm looking for --and by that need.
                        <br>&emsp;This is a quaint ideal, when you consider that it is merely the volume of an otherwise general
                        kind of work. Short shifts is possible, but earned over time, or at oppertune points. Simply settling
                        into a
                        certain amount of work is not so troublesome. And as much as we are not settled, so will fortitude bear
                        us
                        through it; or at least, not be so weighing by the advantage we gleam from it, and the specks of
                        enjoyment
                        and good in the actual task. Over time, habit will even out all, and more than likely, accomodate our
                        preference. "For it is one thing to hope for me, and trust fortune to grant you such; and another to
                        hope
                        for less, and by that, be granted the simple privalage of being invovlved, but not so much."

                        The world is a remarkable place. Indeed our judgements come to pass, when we see all the variety of
                        elements: and the according sense that in that, lies so much bad.
                        <br>&emsp;But we not ought start here though. As we are more than likely ignorant of all the proportions
                        and
                        sides of most matters; and along with that, subject more to impulse and prejudice, rather than clear
                        thinking.
                        <br>&emsp;Because of this, I'd state that the world ought be know in total, but upon a sensible approach
                        guilded with propiety and reproach. For it is one thing to try and fail, or have no where to go upon
                        admitting what you don't know; and another to be two steps ahead of where you have any right to be, or
                        to be
                        so concluded, and or deprived, as not to even begin.
                        <br>&emsp;To begin, we must assert fundementals. For all attempts to define and know end up in models,
                        whereby the elements and motion of things get catalogued into various assortments of systems and terms.
                        The
                        weakness here is that we loose the esscence of the very things which were trying to concieve. For it is
                        one
                        thing to define matter, and by that, assign some indeluble sentiment of being --by which said matter is
                        apart of. But such a sentiment ought not hold its own indefinable esteem. "For we may error in
                        attribution
                        to the thing defined, by something which, in all fairness, is used as if also defined, but not actually
                        so."
                        Moreover, we must also consider whether such sentiments are not themselves inseperable from the subjects
                        which we concieve. For how else can we prescribe the being of an object, and not fall prey to the
                        identity
                        fallacy: whereby the object in question, in being, is held to be so by some indefinable sentiment of
                        being:
                        but how is an object which cannot be but besides such sentiment of being, be so, if it is not of some
                        sort
                        already? "The infinite infinite."
                        <br>&emsp;I must admitt our approach is short of any credulity, and by that, merrit in bowing to. But I
                        can
                        say that with fair observation and solid sense, we can erode the brittle neccessities of the past, and
                        more
                        amply prop up the point where theory and questioning begins.
                        <br>&emsp;I might start here, but in an all to bumbling way; or maybe there, but in a way that even I'm
                        not
                        clear on. So we'll simply say, as Socrates similarly held, that all investigative matters begin with
                        terms.
                        For we need to know what were talking about in order to ask questions, and notably progress. Herein
                        though
                        lies the conflict. For the greatrest mystery's of our day are how anything is at all, be it life,
                        physics,
                        the mind. And, admittedly, this has been the focal point of past inquiries as well. It is those rugged
                        neccessities though, whereby little of the past's claims were built on not but a few esteemed
                        observations;
                        and, as one who in fact knows little cuts corners to fill in the holes, so were these deepest questions
                        solved with a brevity that could match the ultimate emptiness of such claims. For the world is indeed a
                        mystery. And even upon our modern observations, 'so the depths further go'. The issue, is that the
                        phenomena
                        needing an explantion are not so different. And by the granduer of such mysteries, so do the awnser need
                        equal breadth. Only, what we know of the world, on the whole and as pertains to said mysteries, is so
                        much
                        contemporaily, that our suppostions need not fill in but the meagerest wholese; in comparison that is to
                        the
                        gapeing casms of which the past held. For in those times, physics was not naturally understood, nor
                        biology,
                        or geology, or chemistry to any moderate degree. And undernstandibly, as we do in our current day,
                        suppositions were made, as to what could explain the world as we deemed it. And I hold no begrudgement
                        over
                        those whose according suppositions were so comapratively innacurate, as they knew so little. I think,
                        all in
                        all, it makes sense, and ougbt not be surprising. It's the reverence though, or credulity, of either
                        myth or
                        tradition, and its cementing of such views, which holds our target of scrutiny. For it is one thing to
                        know
                        little of the world, yet still ask, and by that, come up with deranged anwsers. Empedocles suggested
                        that
                        the earth was made of fire and wind, and indeed, this is a wrong view. But it attempts at least; and
                        beyond
                        that, actually holds with it some fair sentiment, namely in the elemental divesity which things
                        seemingly
                        full are made of. Democritus took this even further, claiming something akin to our own atomic view of
                        the
                        world. The innacuracy ought not be admitted, or heralded, but we can at least respec the inquiry, and by
                        that, sensibility which folded the pieces in an respectable way: even if the pieces were made of dirt
                        and
                        clay.

                        So the issue in all this is one of progress. For if we start with our observations, as to even know what
                        were explaining, and with some privalage, extend this notion of our senses, as if we are only aware of
                        them
                        by within the domain of observation, then we can say, that progressively, that all our explanations
                        ought so
                        far oblige, as to align with the observations so far.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, there is the matter of which observations are accepted; moreose, what observations are
                        actually so, and not premises built from unchecked or absent observation: and conclusions at that.
                        "Hereby,
                        the line of modern and old concepts lie."
                        <br>&emsp;We might say there are many reasons to remain sketpical, if not inquisitive. For it may be all
                        too
                        easy to say, 'this thing which I fully see and am impressed by, cannot be explained but for this reason:
                        even if this means there is something neccessary, or in other words, 'ethereal'.' Yet, if we establish a
                        fair measure of observation, we may either refute such claim, as to its appeal to inplausibility that
                        something coulnd not be the explanation: for it may not be so neccessary. Or, and this is modernitites
                        further growning claim, that the thing you claim to see, is in fact not so as you identify. And so yes,
                        the
                        planets may need the Gods to orbit them, for based on their motions --which may all be fairly assessed--
                        that so could nothing but a divine mover do so. But the baser truth, is that planets are nothing but
                        dense
                        dust, born from the even denser bits of a star ---itself a clump within a stellar cloud. And indeed, the
                        true explanation for these is not known, and perhaps in that, God's hand lie. "But we may fairly refute
                        those who say that such hand is guiding an apparent thing, when in fact, there is nothing truly of the
                        sort
                        being guided."

                        and more or less, did not make it clear I was available anytime. I felt confident though. I phoned back
                        three days later, and he said 'they were going with someone else'. I felt dissapointed, a little
                        frustrated.
                        In the moment, I uttered out as to why this occured, and he said it was to do with the schedule. This
                        felt
                        like a failure on my part. I had emailed him after the interview, exclaiming that I was fine with full
                        shifts; but in retrospect, I had not made it clear I could work anytime. I tried to affirm whether or
                        not
                        there'd be oppertunity later on, and I gleamed that after christmas it would be so. At the end of
                        November,
                        I called Dev to clarify that I could work anytime, to set the record straight.
                        <br>&emsp;So December went by, and I was not sure when to phone. My ease had set me on the first week of
                        January, but as New Years was approaching I felt a nervous haste, and phoned Dev. He was suprisingly
                        happy
                        to hear from me, and said that when things picked up we could come in then. This was what was meant when
                        I
                        had affirmed the possibility prior. Fairly clearly, he said to phone him at the end of the month. This
                        worked well for me, and generally, I felt well.
                        <br>&emsp;January has gone by, and for the most part I've been well. Similar to the end of December I
                        was
                        beginning to feel a nerous haste. I made a passing call on Saturday, and Dev was unavailable. Funnily
                        enough, I went to Superstore that afternoon and nearly ran in to him; but I missed speaking to him. On
                        Monday morning I phoned, Dev picked up, I said it was Ryan Green and that I was checking in; he said
                        that he
                        was meaning to call me, and that I should apply online. He mentioned that I had already been through the
                        interview process, and so, despite setting some sort of meeting/coming in, it was not alike the initial
                        interview: as I had already been vetted. I went on Loblaws, found a part-time listing for Personal
                        Shopper
                        at Superstore, applied, and all was well. I emailed Dev noting this. He replied asking me to confirm my
                        availability. I sent a reasonably long email, beginning with the fact that I could work anytime, but in
                        terms of volume, I preferred to work 2 shifts per week; but I could work 3 if need be, and that I just
                        wanted to be transparent. I ended the email exclaiming 'I can work anytime, anyday, I just prefer 2
                        shifts/week, but 3 is fine'. He did not respond that day. I was nervous about this, simply waiting for
                        him
                        to reply. I had the sense that I'd said to much, and perhaps limited myself to what he would care for. I
                        phoned around noon, as I nomrally planned to, and he was not in that day. Weirdly, less than 5 minutes
                        after, I got an email from the loblaw automaic messenger saying I've got an interview scheduled for the
                        following day. Then a email came immediately after, saying it had been cancelled, and that 'due to
                        circumstances', my recruitment process was being voided. On the intial email it says Dev is the
                        interview;
                        but the email was not from him. I am left to believe that he saw my response, felt it restrictive, and
                        elected to void my application. Only, I sent this yesterday. And I have not received an email back;
                        which is
                        not itself an absolute ceratin in any case. But considering that he is not there today, it would be
                        strange
                        if he had somehow orchestrated that interview, having seen my response ---for if he did not, then what
                        would
                        explain his sentiment-- and from there cancelled it and the application.

                        As a man, I an a bit of a fraud. As I spend too much of my time dreaming, or fortifying myself against
                        issues not there. Too little do I commit myself to anything wortwhile, at least soemthing which matters.
                        Indeed, my dreams center on such topics, but the aim I see is not so as reflects the things which
                        propiate
                        the worth; nor is my intent, and by that lasting stride, made with much care for the obejcts of such
                        worth,
                        but rather of my own. "I dream of saving the world, showing them the way, but all because I am idle, and
                        pleased upon being king, rather than making use of it."
                        <br>&emsp;In this our life is mixed and astray. As beyond our common paces and their sprouting state, we
                        are
                        not with any greater amends: be it to children, community, our selves even.
                        <br>&emsp;Literaily, I spend much time, as writing is a way that brings more life outside of our idel
                        state.
                        Amd do, as a weight against our younger years, does it humble and station our lofty imagination.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am always left is in trying to define the peace upon death, and thereby contempt to
                        the
                        fears and fretting marbling its traditional esteem. Seeing life this way, brings much irrevence for
                        things
                        of a novel sort, and orients you towards more rich and generous things: be it for your own heart and
                        toil,
                        or of people.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I come to pass though, is that there is a complex of pedantry and obscurity. With no ill
                        intent or wicked minds to be fair, but rather a simply an appeal of the past and a lack of honesty as to
                        what best serves our understanding now. God sits here, like a 800 year old porch chair, ricketing, and
                        by
                        that bearing sounds which warrant his claim; yet when you sit on it, the wood and bolts begin to split
                        and
                        crack. "And weirdly, everyone, more or less, has their own view of this chair, and as it were, fight one
                        another to sit in their own view, and in the process defimate those of others. But all because of this
                        fear
                        of death, and the derived concepts of benevolence by those who (in a baser way) soothe such fear."
                        <br>&emsp;It's just hard to imagine economies and governments functioning properly, even under the load
                        of
                        the gritted past, when those invovleve are not equally human. "As such matters are enlivened through
                        social
                        action: but for the requisite communication and invovlement to occur, ought each member be clear of the
                        other. And as is all to common, burn anyone who is not up to par, or congenial rather for the system,
                        and
                        root them out. 'My purity is bound by the arrangements of me and my fellow brethren: such a formation
                        bears
                        us the stability and riches to thrive. But for the sake of such form, ought we both propietous in our
                        personal conduct, as to warrant our place within, but along with that mend any shortcomings of those who
                        do
                        not meet such standard, and in effect weigh the system down'. Such a sentiment is fair, as rats, all be
                        animals with no evil to sport, ought still be treated as vermin, if it is a matter of people succumbing
                        to
                        filth and disease. Root em out. 'Who are the rats though? Who would not fit in, and by that, earn our
                        collective warrant, as to be equitable into our scale for who we preserve for? Who would not be eligble
                        to
                        rid evil for the sake of? Who would not merrit a place amongst those who merely care to survive?'.
                        Indeed,
                        the rats have more clarity as a threat, then seemingly comparable people."

                        It seems a good place to begin, in that we'd mention that the worth of any remark is in that it means
                        something; and generally, this is so, when the quality of our experience is in question. For we may see
                        the
                        ripest of fruits, but out of hands reach: and so we convene to bridge the gap. Or we may be suffering
                        wounds
                        or famine, and by that, work to overcome the pain and depravity. Our souls even, as often treated, are
                        but
                        aspects of us which draw their own concern. Collectively even, our place amidst the whole may bear our
                        amends: as we tailor our point amidst all others.
                        <br>&emsp;For it's usefullness, I tend to work from the sentiment of positivity, which says that, in all
                        things, they move and grow as remarks there orientation within those stated regards: that as mechanics
                        have
                        made them, or their mind and heart whist them to be, so are they moved and sent. Satisfaction compares
                        slightly with comfort, as does inflammation compare with grueling pain. Each are but practical
                        experiences
                        within that natural course, 'whereby the base of things produces ostensibly varied forms of good and
                        bad'.
                        <br>&emsp;To begin then, I'd state that logic is but a behavorial addition to our otherwise living
                        state. As
                        fdr how we think and concieve, and cohoerently, is one thing. But the exhibition of ourselves, be it as
                        we
                        laudily proclaim, or through impulse, is what matters. It is true, that perhaps coming to sight of real
                        knowledge is the greatest thing; but so may we be off in how we see such end, as being so right; for we
                        may
                        in fact be so far off of actually being, at least in the adjoining part of us which is unsubject to such
                        concieving ---ie. our bodies; and as such, so may the end which we seek in terms of knowledge, be
                        entirely
                        unfounded, 'as one's who are elsewhere alive to hoist up our conception --less those may think without a
                        head---may not in fact be so sound in such concpetion, when their living matters are stilted'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt that this raises the issue of the mind's ambiguity, and whether or not it is of the
                        body, be it together, or of some comparable sort. For if it is, then we are merely left with a generally
                        accepted whole of bodies, which together, as bodies, are equally subject to the inquiry of how bodies
                        are at
                        all. If the mind is not so comaprable, though it would be hard for one to identify what it is then, as
                        to
                        then denote what is not in fact a body, then the realms of our inquiry which relate the basis of bodies,
                        may
                        itself be what our mind springs from, but in an extended way, rather than force ---for which natural
                        mechanics are contrived from. That, or there may be seperate non-body realms; or better yet, the realm
                        which
                        the mind is associated with, and a associately derived realm by which the bodies are based on. "The
                        sheathe
                        of matter resting upon, or perhaps entirely foregin, to the sheathe of the mind."

                        The basis for all inquiry is in whether or not any matter of concern can be deemed positivley, or if
                        there
                        is to some extent, a need to suppose. Indeed, there would be reason for all things if we could describe
                        them
                        so postively. While the belief that there is some neccessity, and by that, contrivance, is more in line
                        with
                        oughts. One may say that of that which houses the whole of things, so would it be a certain way. Beyond
                        the
                        weakness of the encumbant lack of positivity, so is there a) no greater positivity when it comes to such
                        neccessary matters, and b) a sort of faintness to any absolute assertion regarding locig, so far is it
                        pertains to how the world is made and governed. "It is either a poor claim, or one whose merrits I am
                        ignorant of, that anything must be, for all we see as evident could not be so. This relies on the
                        identity
                        of such evidence, which is, to the point, unknown." But we are left then, ultimately perhaps resting on
                        the
                        esteem of evidence; which to a degree is fair, and is worth some minimal concession. But all in favor of
                        some conjuring intelligence which orders and governs all. And it is odd for this to have grounds outside
                        of
                        some evidence, 'for which it it is esteemed as propiating'. Indeed, there is a rear end to that, for
                        which
                        there is no need for evidence. But of this, I cannot quite say what it is we think is there. In some
                        sense,
                        it is as if the world which is claimed to be goverend by something baser was absent, and such a base was
                        there inherently.
                        <br>&emsp;To reiterate our argument, the world is either known posivitely, or through some mixture of
                        this
                        and contrivance. Or, there is no world, neccesarily at least. But so lies that realm which would
                        contrive,
                        floating is goes. "A world made and run by God; the faith in reason barring the belief in the latters
                        unneccessity; and God alone, in and of a manner unpertaining to the world. I am not sure though how we
                        know
                        God alone."

                        So, as trouble approaches, or circumstance, I look for every good thing around to smother it. For
                        whichever
                        reason, this takes my mind off the work to come.
                        <br>&emsp;When there is nothing to desire though, the work feels brazen, immediate, and consuming.
                        <br>&emsp;Worth remarking then, is how this toil can be endured through fortitude and, eventually,
                        habit.
                        These drain the looming effect of work, and otherwise make the prescence of it milder.
                        <br>&emsp;I think life ought pay attention to this notion, as indeed, some dream and wonder, and by
                        that,
                        seek security and refuge. While others may simply be unbothered, be it by privalge or their own
                        strenght.
                        But it has never ceased upon me, that what I see and care for changes whether I am emablmed with desire,
                        or
                        abscence of stress.

                        So we say that the cosmic microwave backgorund is an observation, in the way that we observe the light
                        from
                        Alpha Centauri. The CBM is merely a spherical impression of light from all positions, coming from a time
                        that the complexion of the light suggests.
                        <br>&emsp;This is no law though. Just as the orbit of moon around the earth is no law, merely something
                        we
                        observe.
                        <br>&emsp;I will grant leniance to what laws mean, if only to effectively describe them. But of there
                        general nature, I cannot quite say. You have the second law of thermodynamics for instance, which says
                        that
                        all harmonious states tend towards dissaray. "A clump of particles in a chamber will proceed to
                        distriubte
                        themselves evenly, rather than come together." This is what we observe though. And laws, it would seem,
                        are
                        simply coinded deductions, of what occurs under certain circumstances. In this way, laws are esteemed as
                        the
                        cause, in their being a law, as repeated observations are brought by.
                        <br>&emsp;In this sense, laws are pronounced as a basis, or cause rather; as if a solid guess, or
                        inference,
                        to the prescence of something, 'of which the law is a denotion of', for which our observations are
                        explained
                        by. "It is as if a dark hole lay by your side, and every time you dropped a ball in, it came back up.
                        After
                        repeated attempts, you may say there is some undubitable cause which bears such effect: the law of ups
                        if
                        you will. Yet, you do not surely know if it is but a bend of gravity shooting it up, or some pig headed
                        troll."
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, we are left with laws of varied degrees. For it is one thing to describe
                        bioligical
                        laws, 'in that we see animals behave so concurently', and another as to the physical laws which govern
                        these.
                        <br>&emsp;For what we are left with, is a deepening stamp on nature, whereby the phenomena we see are
                        understood to a finer degree. We cannot say the basic cause of such, only, that of the things we see,
                        that
                        nature is so that, by our repeated observations, equal results occur ---varying but in proportion. But
                        of
                        this thing which we esteem as the cause of our observations, so is it unknown.

                        In a quaint room, amidst a calm green country, sat a group of gentleman. Inclined to study and share,
                        they
                        conversed with one another, detailing their recent wonderments. But whereas these sort of occasions
                        tended
                        to be full of profession and prognostics, the mood of this was slighty dapper. For after a time, in
                        which
                        those former described the talk, one of the men simply remarked how ill-founded their statements were.
                        Not
                        that they were ill-placed in fairness or sentiment; nor were they lacking any weight behind their gusts.
                        Merely, he suggested that the heart of their inputs lacked any insight as to whether or not they were
                        wrong.
                        It was mere words being spoken, and little judgement or doubt flown about. Better yet, there was little
                        admission to the vainess in their proclomations, in that, upon considering the past, it was clear how
                        much
                        any prior time was futily wrong. "None so rightly fortold."
                        <br>&emsp;From this remark, the converse shifted, setting moreso on the simplicity of the world, and
                        how,
                        despite our prior claims and speaking, so was it likely to samely remain. Indeed the future is a
                        mystery,
                        and certain shifts will occur. "But a man, despite aging, never looses his heart, or bones."
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, their more humbled and calm remarks centered on the state of the world, and how,
                        in
                        the decades prior, the fortelling was that it would burn in hell; or at least whither into something
                        dystopic. The reality could not be further from that.
                        <br>&emsp;Crime remains, as does depravity. There is rudeness, brevity, pedantry and shame. Nor are the
                        bones of man invincibly secure. There could be war, as are its ways increasingly burning its sides.
                        <br>&emsp;But in all of this, the gentleman attested to the fact, that in all metrics, the world had
                        improved. Of all things risky and hazardous, so are they less severe. And despite certain threats being
                        par
                        for modernity, so is the positive side of such mountanous in comparison. The norms remain, as is the
                        earth
                        beneath us. But the stability which people seek, is more widespread, and not so exclusive. "A far rarity
                        it
                        seems, for a nation not to be as first as the last."
                        <br>&emsp;And, wrapping it all up, one of the men illustrated a reasonable way to understand this
                        scenario.
                        He described the phenoman of technology, and how the prospects of it always excite one to imagine, and
                        by
                        that, dream of the world changing. But little is this feeling ever checked by the smoothness of the
                        past,
                        and how revolutionary change bolts itself onto the mundanity of normal things. Moreose, that these
                        heralded
                        prospects, tend to be unremarked as they settle into the norm; from which the eveness of the world is
                        gleamed, and only some other spark to our imagination can changed that.
                        <br>&emsp;The point of their converse then, was that, despite the expected change, it will not be so
                        stark
                        when the whole of things is accounted for. Governements will be governemnts, as will economies and
                        markets
                        function similarly. There will borders, tress, the sun and the moon. And even upon our dreams being met,
                        will we still need to breathe, or more actively seek food and friendship. "Blade Runner ought to have
                        been
                        set in 2525."

                        As it were, the state of the world was such, that near the end of the century, so was it relatively the
                        same, if not improved. "And perhaps as nicely so, the imaginations of folk had been rendered of, 'like
                        the
                        grissle on a steak'. And as such, there proclivitiy to dream and believe, was more tenured and factual."
                        As
                        such, few see the world a hundred years from now to be to remarkably different. In the century prior,
                        the
                        ability to see all was given, 'yet none had the fidelity or sense to do use it well'. "For which the end
                        felt so near." But as time went on, and the pillars of modernity settled in, so did the norm become one
                        with
                        such advents, 'to which prospects of a similar sort were relatively less remarkable'. "Computers felt
                        like
                        they'd take us into a world so different and prestine; while now, near the top of the century, the
                        imagery
                        of time travel does not blind our view to the things which'd still be common: that we'd be men,
                        breathing,
                        hungry and tired: nor so bored as to care where we invovled ourselves. It is a modern treat, that no
                        where
                        is deemed special, to marvel at beauty, be delighted, and in harmony with folk and friend. 'Take me no
                        where'."

                        Oddly though, this modern norm is not so prestine. For despite its promise of a constance to whats
                        common,
                        and improvements at that, there are still those outside this stream of cheer. In proportion things
                        differ,
                        and that is modernity claim. But still the form remains, in that, to whichever degree, there are still
                        those
                        who steal, who rape, who murder: and not as nearly a concern, but rumours and gospel are no less
                        present.
                        Man may have bruoght those in the mud into the smoothest of streets, but so a hole remains. Part of this
                        modern sensibility, of basic sameness, does relish in the fact that of those in the hole, so are there
                        less
                        so. Along with the cadence of this, 'as more folk are being lifted out than ever before'. Yet, it still
                        haunts one to think that there are those in such despair. And indeed, the prior times ramblings and fear
                        was
                        significantly motivated by this fact: that there were those in need, 'for which the world was to blame
                        for'.
                        And even though the world has shown that she is willing to help, and is more than likely to remain
                        normal
                        and secure, so is she subject to scrutiny, and insecurity. For these remarks of mine are not made as to
                        say,
                        that all in modern life are happy and pure, while those in the hole are merely calm and waiting. There's
                        still a dispotion to our freedoms which has not yet flourished. Nor, has there been a blossoming of the
                        culture, as to mightily reflect our modern state. "People may not be as put off by other's squabblings
                        and
                        pedantry, for of the norm, they know. Yet still the squabbling lays."

                        So civ is coming out. It is 90$ standard. I will be buying this. I have a chunk of change at Coast, near
                        1800$ in TD ---with no more charges. We get 200 in April and July. And we've just become employed --with
                        no
                        current expenses. So I'll pay for this.
                        <br>&emsp;The question, is whether we buy the deluxe edition. The founders edition has more dlc coming,
                        but
                        in the summer, while the deluxe DLC comes shortly after launch. Admittedly, there are so many Civs as it
                        is,
                        so these new ones won't be fixing any absence. So for 40$ for, you can play 9pm on Wedensday, or wait

                        I'm
                        thinking of the Hammerfall area, and the northern coast around, moving then to the western flats. The
                        jungles and eastern mountains have Griffins and airforce, and somewhere between that lies a ocean

                        Asking questions is satisfying, as the whole world feels infront of you. Similar to a stressed moment,
                        where
                        the elements of your life get twisted and show only their harshest glare, so in a state of inquiry and
                        cheer, do you see broadly and nicely. The love of outdoors come's to pass, 'as if a prisoner, despite
                        their
                        seclsion, was still graced by the sun, or moon, the birds even'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt though, that when we are not so cheery, or able to happily see, we get burdened by
                        something along the lines of sympathy. For none who are truly occupied care for, or are wounded by the
                        chimera's of man or animal's plight. But as someone who is quite deep in their sights, so is a posture
                        which
                        cannot stand to it, one which retains the domain; but in that, holds onto things, or at least, gets
                        intruded
                        with things, in a less fair or pleasing fashion. "For my world, as I see it, becomes part of me, like
                        that
                        prisoner, who remarks upon their entrapment with the prescence of things aruond it; for which we
                        similarly
                        hold our peace by the sun and moons prescence."
                        <br>&emsp;The geography of discourse though is rampant in these parts. And, while I have a large and
                        spanning view of things, so is it more of a model, rather than a exact understanding of any particular
                        point. Suggestions then unravel me, as I have much familiarity with the subjects, but not their matter.
                        And
                        so, the loose story telling or commentary on such regards has a spot within me, in which it settles: but
                        there is not meat on the bone so to speak, 'to which the impression does so fully upon me'.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, in my finer strides, these inputs don't have as easy of access, as the spots we
                        have
                        wihch are more filled out, give a general aura of being filled. "Like the contributions of a forest upon
                        the
                        atmospehre, whereby its local point drifts up into the encompassing whole, blocking out the sun."
                        <br>&emsp;What I can say then, is that we are burned with sympathy. For our knowledge has exposed us to
                        the
                        condensed nature of cultural digestion, and therein exaserbated our imperfections, 'wherein such inputs
                        come
                        in more heavily: because our general knowledge has given space, upon our vulnerability to impression
                        that
                        is'.

                        I think the heart of intent draws from the relationship to our dad, who is someone that I love in some
                        sense, but fear in another. For he is the one person who is always telling me what to do; and holds a
                        certain strenght and authoirty to do so.
                        <br>&emsp;But as one gets older, they are either a) less receptive, or b) better able to communicate
                        when
                        you disagree.
                        <br>&emsp;I bring this up though because of a similar relationship I have with the world. Simply, there
                        is a
                        suggestion sometimes that it is off, or at least in need of assistance. And my common experience doesn't
                        jive with that; and I am somewhat positive of what is true otherwise.
                        <br>&emsp;From this, I wish to better state things, for our sensibility is merely a means to ignore
                        things,
                        or be unpertubred by them. While knowledge is about solidity, in that even the roughest push could not
                        move
                        you. In the former's case, akin to happiness and peace, you are simply less struck by things, and by
                        that,
                        less prone to being drug by drama and fluff. But if you are busy or tired, or at that stressed, then you
                        become more rigged, and more likleey to have impressions cling onto you. "Where they might otherwise
                        slip
                        off." Of our regards then, so our knowledge lies. For whatever we are attending to, there is not but
                        what we
                        know which can be used for refutation. Indeed, we may known things in a light or impartial way; or,
                        considering the question at hand, peraps its form is made based on your 'rugged tone', to which the
                        knowledge needed is absent. In this, we say, that be it smooth and normal, or rough and tumbly, that the
                        iumpression dealt with be consented to or overted, based on the knoweldge you have. "Does this line up,
                        fit
                        nicely, or is it far off, and right to remove."
                        <br>&emsp;Where we come to then, is the matter of positivity, in that, of the world, we truly see, and
                        by
                        that, hold room for even the most ill-set and pointed impressions.
                        <br>&emsp;As is the world bent along the inquiry of need or reason, so is life bent along the submission
                        to
                        ease and negativity. In one, you have concerns about whether the world as seen, and further so, is what
                        remarks how the world is, and by this, how our actions should lie. That, or whether this is implausible,
                        and
                        a baser impetus is required to make, what may otherwise seem evident, so. "And whether someone can know
                        what
                        such impetus is, fairs a sort of reason itself: as if one proclaimed the motions of sea, and things
                        within
                        it. But all more likely, that the neccessities proclaimed were made in fallacy, and not thereby known."
                        We'd
                        say in this case, that the need for the sea to be what explains the objects in it, or rather, that the
                        objects needed a sea, or basis, to be as they seem, for them to be so, did not rightly explain how such
                        basis was, for, of the objects which it was the cause, or basis for, so were such objects, via our lack
                        of
                        faith in reason, with an identity which was naturally so; to which, we defame any baser claim, when such
                        claim was made with the complexion of such basis in mind, rather than the mere neccessity of one; which
                        is
                        so, for the source for what we describe such basis on, is of the objects which it, in a deemed
                        complexion,
                        is so as to correspond with, in the way it is, as to produce, throught such of form of it's, the form of
                        objects which it is the proposed cause for.
                        <br>&emsp;The point being, that the need for a baser explanation, or impetus rather, is merely so if the
                        world is deemed to be unexplainable otherwise. "Contrasting one's faith in reason." While this is fair
                        in
                        principle, to propose at least via the skepticism of that which we mean to describe, so is the abscence
                        of
                        that lacking a block to any proposition which proclaims the nature, or rather form, of such basis. There
                        are
                        proper arguments as to what such basis would be, but merely on the matter, or principle rather, of there
                        neccessarily being something at all, and by that -devoid of what there is, potentially or as seen- how
                        it's
                        form would be. But as we know such form based on what we suppose the inherent being is, we cannot claim
                        to
                        know how it is with relation to objects derived from it, when such objects are (in this case)
                        definitively
                        unknown. "As saying they are so (undefined), is how we draw the conlcusion of their neccessary impetus."
                        And
                        it is a fallacy indeed, to remain unclear of motion and substance, as we'd deem whole and natural, but
                        therein describe the arbitrary force stated as being the explanation for that which we don't know, or
                        feel
                        can be fairly said, discovered or known, and therein ascribe properties to such force which are drawn
                        from a
                        relation to an effect which they are --in the manner of their form-- to be esteemed as causing.

                        vice, whereby I ruslte and stir, knowning I've erroed, and am apt to continue.
                        <br>&emsp;We are no man though. For a man is one who is truly like this, rightfully happy. While I am
                        one,
                        though perhaps wise, is but someone who's tasted the sweetness of this happiness, and danced towards her
                        tune. But in our imperfection, we slip and drag a little, yielding to an admittedly honorable brace to
                        what's good, and not an retreat into what's bad. But in this brace, as all those committmed naturally
                        feel,
                        there lies an all to flat reverence for the process of right being, or an all to gripping hold on the
                        good
                        it springs.
                        <br>&emsp;For in our delight, as virtue springs in us, we see the moon and sun, the trees and stars. And
                        as
                        we rest genlty, but tenderly too as our mind alights, we mellow into a full embrace, of our standing and
                        sights around. We are one, upright and privy.
                        <br>&emsp;But these sights, like peak scenes from a mountain top, become handles which we hold onto when
                        we
                        are not so postured. When we slump, we miss those things so charmingly dear, and hold onto the pinnacle
                        vista's. Worth noting, is that in our wandering ways, that not always are we privy to such magic.
                        Equally
                        are we composed, but perhaps subject to mere chirp of a bird, or calm scope of the land. These don't
                        settle
                        in us as the richest of vibrnaces, but merely broaden our appeal, and thus experience. This should be
                        fine,
                        as our posture, be it delighted by the Gods or his simple lands below, happily flows in and out of such
                        scenery. But when our posture tightens and we can no longer see things simply, we concentrate our gaze
                        and
                        change position, as to see those more wonderful things. "As we feel either empty, or drawn to the
                        plastic
                        abyss below."

                        I'm not bitter, nor pessemistic; and never have been. For all our misgivings, none of them seem to occur
                        but
                        by an apparent fault. We've always experienced the opposite of this, and to such means, disposed
                        ourselves
                        towards. But of all things bad, there is never something which, I'd admitt, as not being wrong.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, one may simply ask themselves, in whichever way they feel and seem, would it not
                        likely
                        be so that the worst of this was such, if any given parameter was present? Would you not lose sleep and
                        concentration from eating poorly or not exercising? What if your merely slept late, or missed a walk
                        prior,
                        or ended up with a blanket? Our experience has only shonw us such.
                        <br>&emsp;I say this, for what is good bears itself through choices which, upon their lapse, blurr such
                        goods: to which we learn. But, as remarked in the past, the beginnings of such regards usually begin
                        with a
                        stoutness to such fidelity, and only so. Then, as these matters become normal, so do we focus on the
                        goods
                        born from them, giving them more catered time and attention --as we did the means.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a confusion though, namely of whether we can be aimed for such goods, and thus their
                        mean. For any doubt of this, or imposition, will lead one astray. And, generally, by whichever heart
                        that is
                        proposed to such ends, so do they move to such through thicket and mud, 'heading the contempt and
                        scrutiny
                        of others'. Since these are but words, and act more like oncoming winds, rather than halting storms, so
                        do
                        we proceed rather fully. But, since there is such friction, or tilting of our aim, so in practice do we
                        take
                        our goods and bank them on meeting such. Which is to say, that of the pressures we face, so do the
                        pieces
                        which stick to us curry our interests to be aimed at such. At least, we humour both our heart and that
                        of
                        success --for which were scorned against.

                        The mist noticable thing is your sleep. Waking up late is quite poor, as is not going for a walk. A
                        blanket
                        ought be used either a) following your initial sleep, or b) if you purely would like it. You need not be
                        averse, but cater yourself to do without, by wearing warm socks, the right jacket, and with the lamp
                        light
                        by your side. I contend that waking up early is so beneficial, that watching a movie or playing a game
                        may
                        occur instead of immediately going for a walk.
                        <br>&emsp;As walking after workouts, along with catching your breathe is good, so is walking prior. The
                        notion goes, that the later your up, the more you have to do, to get up to speed. The issue with waking
                        up
                        late, is that your body has not eaten, but is not in any lively state; and so your hungry, but then
                        slowed.
                        In that, you have to work so much in a short amount of time. Extending this, waking up at a moderate
                        time
                        allows for an immediate followed by subsquent walk, each moderatley short. Waking up early can extend
                        that
                        initial walk; thoug, whether you take a second, or have a long one initially is unclear to me. Waking up
                        early may not faciliate training.
                        <br>&emsp;White bread is obviously killer, but raisin bagels can delight. English muffins are quire
                        whole,
                        but soft whole wheat can be nice. Naan is fairly whole, despite its whiteness, but so a good treat it
                        bays.
                        Crackers are mostly poor, some poison. But the hard wheat ones are not so off, like popcorn. Cereal has
                        never been great, as granola bars, but akin to natural chips, so is there fairer kinds; be it the kashi
                        nutrigrain, or basic quaker bars. Honey Nut is quite sugary, but ripe for the fairest decadence. Peanut
                        Butter granola may serve you better, though price is not terrific. Sometimes thinner kinds of food are
                        preferable over their counterparts, namely hasbrown patties over potatoes; as your care for one may be
                        just
                        in kind, and the simpler form may be what you need; as you'd otherwise wish for something of a fuller
                        sort.

                        I admitt the seperation of land and sea, as one is not so useful, nor benefited by much of the formers
                        gains. But for interest sake, so can it be made.
                        <br>&emsp;In general though, there are spots selected for certain hunts: be it wolves, raptors, terror
                        birds, allos, sarcos, griffins or wyverns. Rexes and things of the sort hold more of a utility, and not
                        of a
                        mobile but bracing sort.
                        <br>&emsp;To bear all this, one may live via industry, setting up bases where metal, obsidian and
                        crystal
                        can be claimed. The Quetzel may then be used as a mobile pen; but otherwise, little hunting compounds
                        can be
                        set up, to both hold your residence and tame storage. Breeding is not so pervasive in all species; so a
                        general station may be had; or one local to the tame in question at their respective spot, ie. wolves.
                        <br>&emsp;Because taming is at the core of our experience, kibble is needed. By that, we need egg
                        layers,
                        and plant growing, which in total, requires crystal for the greenhouse, and secure space for the
                        breeding.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of tools, a navy is paramount; as reaching and transporting materials is otherwise a
                        trouble. At that, a ready supply of munitions makes such travels possible. Alongside that are the actual
                        means to taming, namely sedation. Materials can provide solid means for darts, while basic gatherers and
                        assembly can make abundant narcotics (and munitions). Further in the progression lies the tranq gun,
                        which
                        is quite usefull for taming animals in harry scenarios; be it a griffin, a quetzel, wolves and deep sea
                        creatures. "Things in areas of danger, that more or less demand a hasty sedation. With kibble being the
                        prompt means to acquire them."
                        <br>&emsp;As for our travels, there is a novel strip of plains in the north; but it's otherwise blocked
                        by
                        the mountains south of it, and the rugged terrain seperating it and eastern plains. The bulk of the
                        south is
                        a forest, and a fairer inlet to the mountains. The northeast holds griffins and Wyverns, near Volcanic
                        lands. And linging the southwest is a massive jungle. The western strip holds a sea, dividing spots of
                        islands and peaks further out, and woodlands lining the rocky flats. This area is quite accessible, but
                        lacks an abundance of resources. There are spots of them around, but the lower parts of the world hold
                        the
                        most ---including the rich, yet hazardous lands of the desert far south.
                        <br>&emsp;Tames begin with moderate damage and health, scaling logarithmically. Player stats are
                        similar,
                        but more regressive, causing you to input more as your level increases. Breeding begins fast along with
                        maturing, slowing as time goes on. Plus, the nights get longer, requiring better lighting and mobile
                        protection. Dino levels begin at .33, going to .66 once you get muntions, then reaching a full state
                        once
                        your industry is settled. Tinkering with the Ark can be sometimes effective, othertimes not. It is easy
                        to
                        remove dinos, but not so much to increase their prominence. Though, total values can be changed, but not
                        so
                        easily for particular ones. Nor changing their particualr effectiveness. I used to think that adding
                        ultimate creatures would flesh out this concern, but this means the game is normal less you run across
                        these
                        creatures. The better choice, is to have less than daunting threats, yet improved ones, more common
                        throughout the land. More alphas, harder dinos, increased numbers making it more likely you come across
                        packs.

                        I know what it means to be happy. We are constantly so, and thus know.
                        <br>&emsp;But saying can be a problem, as the terms used to described it tend to come from different
                        seeds.
                        Virtue for instance, has this esteem and flair as the thing which brings happiness, but does not then
                        detail
                        what such thing it brings. Similarly, hard work and a sensible mind, will bring money and success; but
                        these, in fairness, ought be taken to mean, that more things can be acquired; and indeed we tend to
                        concieve
                        of this as owning a home. But herein lies the problem, in that of the former's case, the definite mean
                        is of
                        some object, rather than mode of being. For why is the object good? Is it not by it's relation to you,
                        and
                        how through it's use you are? What then is the thing which you'd wish to spring? Is it furry and might,
                        or
                        calm delight?
                        <br>&emsp;Most of my remarks settle on the ends of our actions. The confusion therein lies, in that such
                        attention is not about where my actions go, but rather where they've come, 'to ends already treated'. I
                        more
                        or less assume that I am not going to change. And despite our view of things being off, in complexion,
                        so do
                        things not change in themselves. And so I notice for instance, that certain foods make me soft and
                        mushy,
                        while other's bring vitality and strenght. I remember this, note it, and contend myself to act with such
                        in
                        mind. For we all mean to do well, and none differ in this. Where we differ is in what we consider good,
                        or
                        set for wellness. A glycemic food is apt to have a glycemic effect; and such effect may mingle with
                        other
                        motions, to which we simply say, with some objectivity, that within a given person, however those other
                        motions are, that of the involvement of something glycemic, so will any given food contribute such.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in the amendment to concerns which treat us in happiness, rather than
                        remedying common problems present to everyone else. It is not wise in my view to worry about such
                        things,
                        but instead to turn one's cares to happier ends. There's a richness at least, when I attend to myself;
                        and
                        in doing so, there's little I imagine that those common troubles would matter to me.
                        <br>&emsp;I guess I can only be a man enough, as to be honest with myself, and be so apt and principled
                        as
                        not to be drug down by the squabblings of those around. For in those moments, when and where I notice,
                        that
                        so are we unable to contend with them, 'for of our honesty, so are the elements of it hard to state'.
                        That I
                        feel calm and delighted, full of rigor and deep breathes: such is hard to exclaim.
                        <br>&emsp;I find, in our fuller moments, that nothing is seen in unity, but in systems, fledging and
                        sprouting, 'akin to every fish and coral in a reef'. This removes both our presumption of how any
                        individual
                        thing is, and by that, what we can expect any individual thing to be; but also, that there is thereby no
                        whole of which our abscence of an indivudal part, collapses it. This is an odd physical property, in
                        that
                        things have motion via their relations; but not so much that there unified into a fabric, but instead
                        brought to motion in company. And indeed, it is not unclear that all impacts the rest. But that any one
                        motion is here because of some motion far away, ignores how many other motions there are in between.
                        "Thus,
                        making such whole concepts poor in as much as they poorly concieve."

                        Our actions ought be constant, in that they are not winding this way or that, subject to the whims of
                        the
                        world, or our fancy. As it were, the currents of life push us one way or the other; remarking the fact
                        that
                        were bobbing, rather than diposed; whereby, be it in winds or calmness, we act defintiively.
                        <br>&emsp;I find that all actions are best when they treat you to a feeling of ripeness. This means a
                        mixture of tenderness and strenght, evenly and set, and not prone to wearniness or haste. Nor ought this
                        be
                        bridled with ambition and perversion.
                        <br>&emsp;I have noticed these feelings, and a correlation to certain actions. In the way that a certain
                        amount of exercise produces fatigue, so do ceratin actions bring delight. Or better yet, prime you to
                        experience delight, by those things, whicb by your hoisted mind, draw delight.
                        <br>&emsp;We are not like everyone else though, in terms of how we apply ourselves. And, as we linger in
                        our
                        fruition, so do the gaits of others seem imposing, or worthy of envy.
                        <br>&emsp;This is the heart of our reflections. For I generally need no assurance as to the right thing;
                        as
                        our experience bends us naturally. Rather, it is the definment, as not to wain under other's prescence,
                        which I produce, as to be sturdy in our imperfection.
                        <br>&emsp;For growth is a winding affair, and in your side steps or setbacks, so are you left vulnerable
                        to
                        the cares of others.
                        <br>&emsp;Importantly, I am alone, and this is why I see others stair. For I know none who care for such
                        delights, or live as though there are no problems. And so, if I were to have a friend, then I would
                        surely
                        be more certain, and at that, less liable to imposition in our impressionable state. "As I had others by
                        my
                        side." Nor, is our actual definition and resolve something which I can fully state. And understanding
                        with
                        others, would bring said support, but also a clearer interest ---our abscence of which invites such
                        impositions.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, I've noticed that eating well and exercising wholesomely, brings a sort of composure
                        and
                        cheer; whereby work becomes simple, your desires easily met, along with a glaze of self respect and
                        generous
                        attention; melding together to form a flow of life, whose past is not forgotten, nor the present loathed
                        over, nor the future longed for, but all mooments, as have been or are to come, blending smoothly
                        together.
                        This experience bolsters itself by actually remarking upon whats right, so that our contrast to other
                        people
                        is not merely out of interest, but propiety.

                        For some reason, my gravest aversion is to the proclomation of problems. I overt myself from this, and
                        try
                        and minimize the extent to which others hear it. A world with problems is one of conflict, possibly at
                        least.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, I don't fret over issues, but rather commentry and discourse; as these matters seldom
                        speak of the concerns in great detail, but merely exclaim them as a basis for bouts of talking. My
                        cynicism
                        does not lie in the extend of their speech, 'and that they merely wish to do so, and heard'; but instead
                        in
                        the baseness of the problems which they speak to. There is seldom notice of the many happenings of the
                        world, but instead the pointed remarks in it. None of the elements and matter which consitute things is
                        mentioend or adhered to when speaking, or proclaiming. And at heart I believe people know this. For
                        indeed,
                        hearing such discourse influences their own speaking. But merely that. For none, despite an otherwise
                        abidement to such proclomations, every decree it to me or anyone; except for their rumblings in
                        discourse.
                        It is never a mark of our life, or care rather outside of our interests in remarking upon it. I'd say
                        that
                        our abscence of happiness, in prominence, leads me to seek resolve and amends to the actual happenings
                        of
                        the world. Or, more importantly, our attention to do so. To a degree this is fine, 'for in one's idle
                        fancy,
                        ought they dream of richer glories, than novel ones'.

                        The oddest thing in the world is the discrepancy between selg-giving and peacefull acquirment. Most of
                        wisdom is aimed at the later, while some sort of sense is bent on the former. I notice sometimes I wish
                        for,
                        and feel repented towards, the sake of such former; though, in my finer strides with the latter, so are
                        the
                        concerns of the former muted.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel that, outside of wisdom, there is this self-oriented view; one of which then views all
                        things around, however wide and stetching, as united, and by that, of a certain state which you may
                        alter;
                        or are indebted to be rightfully part of. There is no surprise then, that in repentance and remorse, or
                        glory even, that such feelings are in tandum with the whole of things. "Whereby our being is in line
                        with
                        all of entirety; to which, a grieving state will see all the world as such. And, herein, lies the

                        So to great rejoice, I was able to play Civ this afternoon. Starting the game I was happily pleased,
                        though
                        awkwardly impressed upon the intitial beginning. A moment weny by and my mind was blown. There is so
                        much
                        detail in the features and improvements, and the motion of the units paired with this, makes for a rich
                        and
                        appealling experience. I can literally think of 100 cool things about it. And, notably, much of this is
                        new,
                        and not what I expected, or am familiar with compared to past civs. I have been able to get the basics
                        up
                        and going, but there are many specific things which I am not entirely sure; nor is my overall graps as
                        cultivated. Namely, there are several kinds of buildings, and multiples within that. Each sort though
                        benefits in their own kindred way. Whether base yields are important I do not know, but there is
                        literally
                        too little space nor enough population to have a fair amount of those, and all the urban improvements.
                        By
                        that, for the sake of culture, gold or science, you may focus a city down one way. That, and learning
                        which
                        buildings are which, be it happiness or gold buildings, will allow for land, unqiue buildings and
                        wonders,
                        to be seen as optimal, based on adjacency.
                        <br>&emsp;My experience thus far, is that there have been endless choices, each leading to some choice
                        difference, or a simple boost. And there is so much choice, in governments for instance. 50 turns in and
                        we've had 3 celebrations, yielding 20 for 10 turns each. I am unsure about converting to cities, but
                        almost surely, in the early game, when you only
                        have your capital, you can literally finish turns in a moment, as the load time is near instant, and you
                        only have the
                        one city producing something. The use of towns is fit to uncover, but in terms of tinkering with things,
                        it's generally
                        your main town, with little but unit movements in between. Which, on it's own end, is much smoother; as
                        researching
                        sailing unlocks embarkation, and going into and out of coast (from a non-rough tile) costs nothing.
                        Recognizing rough
                        tpyes of terrain is an advantage when exploring or trekking troops, but generally, it is pretty easy to
                        get where you
                        want relatively fast.

                        I'm sitting here then, having been tired, and near the end of the day, and having played several hours
                        to a
                        pleasing degree, and with a filled mind, I see that this experience is not one which we must work soley
                        towards, nor remark as work itself. It ought, and has never not shown to not be, simple. Being well
                        creates
                        such, as we are steady in the moment, unassailed by the future, nor lingering from the past. We
                        incorporate
                        things, with out fear or lust, and thus proceed more wholly, intigrating such fuller experience; makig
                        it
                        easier to further be.
                        <br>&emsp;But such a process is limited by ourself. Not the goods themselves, or our common deeds, but
                        our
                        paramount action. For instance, if we ate sugar indiscriminately, we literally would be so poor in our
                        activity. As we would not sleep, exercise, nor read, walk or write. Our happiness, had this been our
                        lasting
                        choice, would come from the company of otther people, be it fitting for such lifestyle, or directly
                        invovled
                        with our consumption.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the issues were facing then, is in overting ourselves from anything bad, but not doing
                        anything otherwise good. We don't eat poorly, but no exceptionally either. We don't lounge, but our
                        exercise
                        is unremarkable, nor consistent. I don't always feel like theres enough room or peace to lean into those
                        better strides; but I am also indebted to this, and getting to it; for which I don't lreiqnuish myself
                        to
                        those lower standards. "Like were haulting, rather than turning to a poor direction."
                        <br>&emsp;As an open remark, we have been hired. The process of this seems fair and managble, and not
                        likely
                        to be short of pleasantries. There's also much good to simply come from this, namely in our finances,
                        and
                        that of our stability at home. For I hold no aversion to being here, other than the remedy of being
                        somewhere I can be happy. If we are full and well, then our lower states hold almost no notice by
                        others;
                        and our fuller states were never an issue before.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I sit then, is in trying to get some motion into this right state; for which I may
                        conceive
                        and judge fairly. Our goodness is less in preperation, as if our employment was something to be fearfull
                        of.
                        Rather, in our upright stride, we somewhat exceed what the good of that employment brings, and can act
                        in
                        the right way which it's making the base for.

                        What I've noticed about 7, is how important your capital is. For it is going to be your largest city
                        early
                        on, and thus apt for urban development. Your towns may have a building or two, but since each costs
                        gold, it
                        will be limited by that; nor will the growth reach much beyond 7, wherein you specialize, or convert to
                        a
                        city; allowing for productive development.
                        <br>&emsp;The main thing, is that buildings are inlufenced by terrain or other buildings. The basillica
                        for
                        instance adds influence to monuments and amphithers. Or the temple of jupiter adds even more happiness
                        to
                        happiness buildings. Wonders to have an effect like this; the Colleseum for instance, adds happiness to
                        completed districts, called quarters.
                        <br>&emsp;Most of your developments are vying for space with rural tiles. And, generally, if production
                        can
                        be used, the value of that tile is superior, as it can hold two buildings; though this accrues higher
                        gold
                        costs.
                        <br>&emsp;As far as I know, science benefits from resources, as do the production buildings. Monuments
                        benefit from mountains, and I am unsure what gold and happiness buildings benefit from.
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing is the investment into legacy points and diplomacy. Increasing your
                        relationships
                        will increase the chance of them supporting your endevours and war efforts. You only have so much
                        though, as
                        are indepentants ripe for investment --in becoming suzerain. Legacy wise, you get more options based on
                        how
                        well you do, in settlment increase notably, but also attribute points. Completing all is no easy task,
                        but
                        you can reach early milestones. Build 2 wonders, have 6 settlments, or some mix of less with captured
                        ones
                        (which count as 2). Getting resources seems fairly simple, as you naturally do as you expand. Codexes
                        though
                        are a mystery to me, and besides unlocking some through masteries, I know not how to get many, or their
                        core
                        benefit.

                        The biggest issue in my life, is that we are not eating enough. There are indirect effects from this
                        which
                        have their result, but all from the source of our famished state.
                        <br>&emsp;The issue has always been that eating during the day is hard. If you eat breakfast, than time
                        slows, and lunch, so do you sleep. Generally I eat more in the afternoon, but particualry, we've been
                        eating
                        much less during the day, and admittedly not that much at night.
                        <br>&emsp;We've said, rightly, that our interests are in reading, writing, gaming, film and vids,
                        walking
                        and remaining upright. I also care to sleep well, sit well, work well, and stroll through life with
                        vigor.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a limit to this though, and I can only chalk it up to us not feeling free enough to
                        partake insuch interests as we please, and not otherwise contradcit ourselves. We'll notice if our rest
                        and
                        leisure time is

                        So I am struggling to bring my strategy together, partially out of expeirence, and our uncertainty of
                        things.
                        <br>&emsp;First, towns can become cities, and require no gold once this is done. They must reach pop 7,
                        and
                        costs 400 gold to make into a city. I believe the cost goes up per each city. One of the oddities of
                        this,
                        is that without a city, you cannot build a wonder. So I saw a massive desert and thought it worthwhile
                        to
                        build Petra. But I did not know if we would be able to plant the city, grow it to 7, make it a city, and
                        still have the time and production to make the Petra (as it comes in the second tier of the civics).
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing, is that independant states are quite prevalent in the world, and are either
                        hostile, and pervasive, or friendly, and apt for suzerainity. Also, based on the state type it is, when
                        destroying one you'll get 100 of that resource. Which is not unimpactfull, considering that buildings,
                        or a
                        city conversion, are a small multiple of this in total. In this way, focusing on military can allow for
                        land
                        control, some resource acquisition, and potential captures. The commander then is an odd one, as it
                        really
                        adds movement between engagments, and eventual buffs. If you mean to military early on, it seems
                        worthwile
                        to choose Discipline, and opt for a weaker pantheon. It's just hard to expand otherwise.
                        <br>&emsp;Overall, I can't tell exactly what lands are worthwhile, as their being a town seems different
                        than a city. Growth, gold and resource seem to point of such expansion, along with using gold to
                        purchase
                        buildings. "You may go to a mountain, and spend money on a monument and villa."

                        If we were wise, our actions would remark a fixed principle. For, all observation brings with it
                        respectable
                        insight. But, as if loose threads which we sew and tigthen, so is one newly loosened one not a remark of
                        those it's looped around. Indeed, an overly tight one will bear down on others.And so our reflections
                        need
                        not change based on one insight; rather, it ought contirbute the material relevant to it. Yet, like our
                        breath, so have we observed much, mildly and deeply. And so should our actions reflect this summation,
                        altering so much as it changes; but all the likely in degress, as the changes to the basis are (to a
                        degree)
                        changed.
                        <br>&emsp;The most important aspect of our life, is that we sit on the floor. We do this because we
                        experience strenght and greatness; and none of our interests feel as true and lively otherwise. As such
                        we
                        amend.
                        <br>&emsp;This requires though a fair balance of strenght, aerobics, stability, recovery and rest. One
                        invovles range of motion under stress, ie. pushups, squats and pullups, the other running and free range
                        of
                        motion, ie. skips, rotations, high knees. Stability holds us in a gentle brace, flowing through standing
                        twists and folds, shoulder flexsions, extensions and pauses, leg raises and back extension, along with
                        the
                        ripe motions of warrior and runners lunge. "There is room for our non-sagital planes of motion to be
                        addressed, as well as how we better stretch and hold our shoulders, lower back and legs." Recovery is
                        more
                        active, though it is the most accomodating, being more inclined to hold, or be more flowing. While rest
                        is a
                        mere sensibility, to wait, breathe and grow. Let yourself be, incorporate the moment or day; be it in
                        forms
                        or cleansing.
                        <br>&emsp;Key principle, is do some sort of standing when you wake up, going through a squating motion,
                        ideally do some sort of leg raise and brace, and almost neccessarily, some sort of spine flexion and
                        extension. Runners lunge is a great treat, and if your transition is viable, go through this with
                        everything
                        else. And there should be a rule that at least once, you turn yourself off, bring yourself to the
                        ground,
                        and be with form or rest, breathe and reset.

                        So the point of towns is to aid your other cities in growth, makeing specialists more useful for those
                        one's
                        benefited. You get plus 1 pop when buying warehouse buildings, and besides Augustus (who can by
                        monuments)
                        you cannot buy non warehouse buildings. The town will grow with 50<br>&emsp;
                        less food required, and can specialize at pop 7. You may delay though; and once you do specialize, the
                        town stops
                        growing, and sends it's food to cities.
                        <br>&emsp;I pair this with the notion of eventual cities, and whether a town should be created. For
                        certain wonders,
                        namely the desert ones, the advantage may be to specific to plan on doing so. The priority is the your
                        captiol, and
                        whether you wish to be militaristic, or economic. If your the first, then focus on miliatry, and
                        suzerainity. Choose
                        discipline for commanders if there are many hostile indepenandts. If your going purely economic, then
                        forgo suzerainity,
                        and engage in diplomatic ventures. Non hostile independants are quicker to convert, though cost 170
                        influence.
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, one could expect, at the very least, to grow their captial via specialized towns.
                        And so, your
                        captiol will likely have its emphasis on wonders and economic buildings, namely gold, culture, influence
                        and science.
                        Production ought be used as an investment to faciliate this, while happiness is a means to expanding
                        beyond your limits,
                        (retaining the postivity in your city), as well as supporting specialists. It would make sense, at some
                        point, to
                        consider where subsquent towns will go
                        <br>&emsp;So the general rule, is cities prioritize production, making wonders and economic
                        developments, while towns
                        prioritize food and resources, sending these to cities to aid their growth. Towns may be converted into
                        cities, but only
                        if there is high production --so it may be a usefull city--- or if it is in a far away point, which you
                        wish to act as a
                        production zone (ie. military, out at sea, for settlersand support)

                        So the basis for eating ought be in allowances. As, only being able to purchase a limited amount of
                        things,
                        directs how you select things, as to round yourself out as best you can.
                        <br>&emsp;As far as I know, we have unlimited spending. Not for dessert mind you, but for everyday
                        goods. I
                        think it's a poor, and admittedly premature, state of mind, to think that we ought spend less to save
                        more;
                        and otherwise use our parents funds, but in a respectably limtied way. We are going to save money by
                        virtue
                        of us making some, and having no expenses besides food. It also isn't worth seeing your expenditures as
                        less
                        here, than would be on our own. I don't know the balance of my spending or my parents, be it of
                        neccesities
                        or meals. But generally, I care not for an abundance of the latter; I don't need almond yogurt or PC
                        springrolls. There's value everywhere, be it for such delights or almond milk.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the things which is killing me is too little food during the day. Some organization of
                        the
                        food we have could aid this, but clarity moreso. I care not for grains, though having them is easier
                        when
                        you've waken up early. Milk and fruit seem the norm, but for whatever reason, the smoothies we used to
                        have
                        were way more filling. I think that we were succeeding at one point, by having nuts and kale, milk and
                        dried
                        fruit. Oranges are always best during the day, with tomatoes and kale early on, and carrots and nuts
                        past
                        that. Seeds seem the best fit for the tomatoes. And indeed, be it sickness, stress, obscurity or
                        dissaray,
                        not eating the kale and tomato centers our lacking. For eating is not so much about calories, but food,
                        as
                        liquids have this effect, whereby you get enough calories, but feel empty; and your body gets a little
                        hollow, particulalry in the gut, and thus chest. There's too little for your colon to feed on, lowering
                        stool bulk, satiation, and strcuture. "Making you feel like your bearing down on a smaller point, to sit
                        upright."
                        <br>&emsp;What do we need then? Well we need a balance of grains, namely in quinoa and lentils, bread
                        and
                        popcorn, along with milk, potatoes, all our roughage, and any thing of a delicate sort.
                        <br>&emsp;Milk wise we have none, and I am admittedly unsure of the pleasure in the vanilla is worth the
                        sugar. It may be, but honestly, I feel to ill to ingest a weakness. Delicacy wise, I'm not terribly up
                        for
                        frozen food, but I do admitt that our caloric intake is rather low. Though, I do feel that most of our
                        concerns come from too little eating overall, rather than pure calories. Food we can, and will eat then,
                        is
                        what I seek. Quinoa and lentils being a prime benefactor of our broader spending. Perhaps some more
                        dates,
                        of a more preferable kind. We've tons of dried cranberries, and a mostly full bag of peanuts. Kale,
                        tomoatoes, seeds, oranges and bananas are got at Langley Mart. Bread wise we've got a servining of the
                        loaf,
                        and 2 frozen E.muffins. I think that the sunharvest 12 grain is a great whole, yummy and filling food,
                        relatively cheap to.

                        can
                        say that our observations are made with a pure basis of such endevour in mind.
                        <br>&emsp;What I've noticed, in terms of worth, is that being on the ground admitts great qualitites to
                        your
                        life. So much so, that even in freedom I'd remain. But we'll discuss this later.
                        <br>&emsp;As regards the reality of doing so, I've noticed as of late that such an act (of being on the
                        ground) runs slightly contrary to eating food; nor is it as feasible without various forms of exercise.
                        That, and ignoring either of these two, while still exhibiting yourself (on the floor, and via its
                        stature)
                        tends to wear you down; resulting in our weight loss and riggedness when partaking in aerobic training.
                        <br>&emsp;Where my amends lie, is in trusting in our constancy, and worrying little of the short term
                        conseuqneces; at least the matter which is relevant to that. As I have lost weight, and our composure is
                        more tall than it is wide. Indeed there is some embarassment from this. But the real point, is that I
                        hold
                        no belief that this is due to being on the floor, or how we eat, but rather how little we exercise. This
                        has
                        come about from the year past, when we've been living a little off, or having to move and aid our
                        family.
                        <br>&emsp;I'll mention this here, but we tend to rest little when our stability is absent. And so our
                        circumstances, albeit permitting of us to live, hold little room or sway to stop. "Nor care for our
                        interests and ways for their own sake, or out of interest and delight that is, and not over bear
                        ourselves
                        to it, as if we have to proove it's worth, or validate it as important --against some otherwise
                        tradiontal
                        claim, which our abscence of makes our own something which we must embellish constantly, or be labelled
                        as
                        contradcictory."
                        <br>&emsp;I don't mean to speak of our life, beyond that is of it's effect on our choices, as pertain to
                        the
                        remarks at hand. I simply wish to reflect on what we've observed, and make for better action.
                        <br>&emsp;For the gravest problem in our life is too little eating. It's not so much calories, but too
                        little food, to sparse roughage. I feel like we do this to accomodate our exercise, but we hold to much
                        effort in leisure and craft; that we end up exercising more than we ought, and living in abudnacne, but
                        with
                        too little food.
                        <br>&emsp;I think the biggest change ought be that we hold food in the same light as we do exercise;
                        responding to it's effect, being deliberate about: as if it were something we had to hanlde, like
                        exercise,
                        or anything else which treats our condition.
                        <br>&emsp;I've never noticed that working out too little is a problem, only to inconstantly. For
                        whatever
                        reason, we work out in large chunks, but then do to our abundance of living and too little food, we
                        stop,
                        and go weeks withotu doing it to any meaningfull degree. This lowers our stretching, stability and
                        recovery.
                        Which makes the reality of sitting on the floor, and in a rather embellsihed sway of activity (for we
                        struggle with rest) a more famished experience. As we don't sit as comfortably or stabily, and thus wear
                        our
                        bodies out.
                        <br>&emsp;We ought let the long period of time which has brought us here be ironed out, and merely amend
                        to
                        do what is right; even if the effects of our past seem present. For we don't need to workout brazzenly,
                        nor
                        miss out eating because we think we have to work out. The key point, is that it may not be something you
                        wish to do; considering, that if you did eat, that you wouldn't wish to train.
                        <br>&emsp;In fact, yoga is our correction, for be it at sessions, or by your private decree, this ought
                        furnish your means of duty and living, in both constitution and remedy. Exercise ought breathe life into
                        this; and tends to do so naturally. But our choices or feeling may be elsewhere. But it is our
                        ricketyness
                        when it comes to eating and living that causes our natural means and rise to exercise, to feel bordered
                        off,
                        or of no interest.
                        <br>&emsp;Now, as for anything specific, the first learning is that eating something for breakfast is
                        essential, as your body feels hollow and bare. This ought not interfer with exercising later, but should
                        come even at it's expense. Following this, we ought eat milk, fruit, carrots, nuts, protein and dried
                        fruit,
                        cooked veggies, bananas, and eventually grains. What we should have in the evening is unclear. But I
                        believe, by the advent of breathing more oxygen form the floor, the relatively concentraed nature of
                        dried
                        fruit, and the strenght which yoga brings, that you may, sufficiently and happily, eat lighter starches
                        and
                        grains for the evening; and ingest as much as you see fitting. You need not stuff your self. Over time
                        you
                        will naturally eat more, and should incorporate doing so via yoga's advent. So you may eat, while being
                        upright. The moral being, that even if you must relax, and not write, or see yourself training tomorrow,
                        that you should still eat. "For those are new expenditures: and we must reconcile what has already
                        come."

                        My energy is low, so some positivity can strengthen us.
                        <br>&emsp;The world never fails to feel amiss when we have lost ourself. We see so little, and grind
                        against
                        the memory that's been. And others saying what is not so fine 'is said memory', bears upon me fear and
                        hatred; for I have nothing in the moment, and so brace my belief in what they say. "It is the positivty
                        of
                        the subject matter which I hold dear, and fret over when absent; but when sprung, to see negatively, I
                        hold
                        to much there already, 'that there short-sighted view twists my own, where the breadth we had is fit
                        into
                        such a shallow form: whereby the remorse in the matter, get's maligned." That is neither here nor there.
                        <br>&emsp;As we have quinoa and lentils, so would corn, tuna and a compliment of grain do me well. More
                        variety would lead to an even consumption, and more of it; as you tend not to eat when the same thing is
                        available. It is hard, but making soups is our oppertunity. As we need something caloric for the midday,
                        but
                        not too weighing. Some mix of carrots, celery, potatoes and other sorts of greens would do. Cooking kale
                        in
                        broth would seem to suffice.
                        <br>&emsp;Our training is far too absent. Were in a spot where not eating enough or living to much wares
                        us
                        down when we do it. Yet, not doing it at all narrows me, and causes our legs to awkwardly cross, and our
                        stomach to overly brace.
                        <br>&emsp;I think that watching Yoga helps us in volume; and going to classes gives us a particularly
                        rich
                        experience, and one which ripples into our own practice. At the very least, it seems fair that we'd do
                        sessions that are effective, and leave our elected time to round it out. I know that lifts, folds,
                        lunges
                        and minor amounts of core round us out, along with ground work twists and breathes. But doing them is
                        not
                        always easy, nor so effective. For we may do things to stringently, or to little, and our harder motions
                        aren't accomodated well. There just needs some consistency, and all we reboot. I've never known us to
                        flourish, or be well, when we weren't exercising, stretching or eating well. So let's do that.
                        <br>&emsp;Food is important, so get some. Iron out your stores, and establish a solid base. Sugar would
                        indeed be fine, if only a stretch of things was not already there. When were not eating so much of the
                        greatest stuff, we end up at thinner points. Considering you only eat so much, starting deeper means the
                        treats and snacks will be less bare and terrible.
                        <br>&emsp;For simplicity sake, I want you to do two things. Run as you will, and train with reservation,
                        follow a guide per day, be it stability or recovery, and eat quinoa and lentils, corn, protein and
                        grain.

                        A few reflections on civ.
                        <br>&emsp;First, the exploration age holds more bounties then you'd suspect. Religion is a gold mine,
                        with
                        it's own civics, and the means to spreading your ehtos around, and benefiting based on the angle you
                        choose
                        --and your appropriate spread. Travelling to distant lands affords Military might along with economic
                        plunder. You must reach shipbuilding though for the gains to be accrued. The use of specialists to
                        sprout a
                        massive tile is tricky, and something which I can't fully speak of. Lower in the tree, at education, you
                        get
                        an extra specialist slot per tile, so perhaps this affords us the mean. Like antiquity, Exploration ends
                        with a crisis. Considering everything get's left behind in modern, having these crisis impinge your
                        wonder
                        building for instance is a sour occurence. Also, you get plus four to settlement limit, up from the 6---
                        irrigation, miliatry training and environmentalism---- Giving you a base 8 ---as you will surely get
                        irrigation.
                        <br>&emsp;Resources are all very key, and fall into two camps. They either benefit your growth, or your
                        infastructure. Fish for instance, grow your towns, which means you can then support your cities quicker.
                        While gold allows you to purcahse buildings cheaper, allowing for quicker town growth. Public Service
                        (in
                        antiquity) and economics (to begin, in exploration) afford merchants, which, limited by the amount of
                        trade
                        relations per civ, offer you access to all sorts of resources. Economics though contradicts your
                        emphasis on
                        religion, which is itself, garnered by several civics, and a criterai for spreading --e.g, plus four
                        yields
                        for cities with wonders.
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing to elevate your play is in balancing tall versus wide. It is nice to grow your
                        capital far and wide, but if you have too few cities, then your not going to scale science or culture.
                        The
                        limit to these is generally military and wonders, plus bonuses --such as codexes and perks. For you may
                        care
                        more for exploration and economy, and use tacticts to fortify yourself. But you may also benefit from
                        more
                        cities. All in all, less you wish to go very wide, wherein city placement is key ---as going over your
                        limit
                        takes happiness away from each settlment, and thus in total based on how many you have, so you ought
                        have
                        some balance to this--- it makes basic sense that you'd have as many settlements as possible, be it as
                        your
                        normal levels provide, or anything which gives extra ---for you will have 8 in exploration, but gain 1
                        or 2
                        through the standard progression of civics and techs.
                        <br>&emsp;Another remark is your development through the age. If your yields are going to be small, then
                        worry not about the depths of the tree, and emphasise masteries and traditions. You may sacrifice
                        momentary
                        growth by having more cities, and then esatbliush more towns to reinstate the growth. "Learning the
                        balance
                        of happinss, in neccessity or for benefit ---as many buildings cost it, as if it were gold--- and gold
                        costs
                        is something you'll have to acquire, as your environment may change, or your civ. And the sense of your
                        strategy, whereby you know what is important to enrich, and what is better measured by sufficinecy."

                        The lands of civ are an odd place. There are things to do, for local or ultiamte gains. The latter I do
                        not
                        know, nor, considering the effort required, are the former of high worth. "Though, the simple things I
                        need
                        are more limiting in terms of our normal means to get them; rather than there lacking any worth at all.
                        Pairing my unfamiliarity, the size of the quest seems more daunting, and thus the reward seems too
                        small."
                        <br>&emsp;You are not penalized though for avoiding these quests, locally at least. Truly, the name of
                        the
                        game is in the breadth of your empire. Indeed, the management of it is key, 'but a well oiled machined
                        with
                        100 horse power will not compete with a rusty 500'.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, all start with 3, and get 4 from irrigation. Atop of the civics tree is a seperate
                        line,
                        ending in entertaintment; while the bottom begins with tactics and ends at miliatry training. Each gives
                        +1
                        settlement. Your own traditions unlock settlements via masteries. Notably, the center of the tree holds
                        merchants, then several great wonders at the end.
                        <br>&emsp;In exploration you get 4 extra settlements, and it is best to fill in your native lands, and
                        venture off to the sea. Treasure resources can accrue gold and economic legacy, but the locations are
                        more
                        select; and you must have shipbuilding to make the fleets. Of note, those treasure resources become
                        factory
                        resources in the modern age; so the transition is clear. But, in exploration, they don't act like cotton

                        we'll
                        figure it out.
                        <br>&emsp;Learning people's names is important, and if you can, write a note about it in your little
                        pocketbook; as it cements the learning ---so you can use said information, rather than doubt it, and ask
                        again. "For who will you ask, 'the person whose name you forgot'."
                        <br>&emsp;I also mean to learn the rules. For on the positive end, we are simply there to be, earning

                        we need, and benefiting by the acitivty and converse. As such, on the happy end, we may connect with
                        others,
                        if not orient ourselves around the work and company of others. In that, we are defined as one who cares

                        gaming, some film, older shows, youtubing, our health, and our interest in science and history. Where

                        So were going back to work, at least in a routine sense. We won't be working much, but our income and
                        stability will fasten.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of our life, there's much I wish to do. But like a problem swirving around me, my
                        natural
                        cares are distracted. For I am apprehensive due to such concern, and unable to happily be as I please;
                        or I
                        am in doubt, of my self, that my interests are born with respect to such concern; and that I ought deal
                        with
                        something rather be drawn to things, in involved as I seem to be pleased with. Writing get's effected
                        this
                        way, as our stiffer moments do keep me pointed towards it, but in a gripping way; and so I feel averse
                        to
                        it, like my interest is poorly placed. "And apparent issues tighten this sense, and thus grief at being
                        so
                        pleased." Though, it is fair to note that what fuels this fire is our actual restless state, and the
                        narrower gait in terms of such interests. "I only mean to say, as we move stiffly, that we condemn
                        ourselves
                        for seeing so: as if the point of such strides are poor." It's as if I can't remember or exhibit the
                        natural
                        care I had prior: in which our stiffer strides come from. "For none pick up a brush in haze and paint;
                        but
                        have done so before, and merely continue in said haze, but stumbly: for they've acquired the means in
                        prosperity, to be more or less formidable in dissarray."

                        more of a culmination, rather than requisite.
                        <br>&emsp;If you build two wonders you get an attribute. If you have a single library you can display
                        three
                        codices and get an attribute point. Have 7 resources, one attribute. Reach 6 settlements, or four plus
                        one
                        which is conquered, one attribute point.

                        Military requires 6 settlments. You get +2 for captured ones. At 9, you get +2 settlements for
                        exploration,
                        which is quite strong.
                        <br>&emsp;Worth noting, is that the tiers of the paths unlock options, but for each, you get points
                        which
                        can be spent on multiple attribtues.

                        <br>&emsp;So codexes are a bit easier. Library has two slots, academy has three. The academy comes at
                        mathematics, which comes directly (and without other need) from engineering; which follows the
                        wheel/bronze
                        working/currency. I believe all three are needed, then you can go straight to enginneering and
                        mathematics.
                        If you get 12 codices, there's an option to retain the academy adjacenies. The second tier gives +1
                        science
                        to all codices in exploration. Nilanada (comes at literacy, following citizenship and code of laws),
                        gives
                        +3 science, 2 codex slots, a codex, a science attribute point, plus, literacy gives a codex.
                        <br>&emsp;In total, the palace has 1 slot, library 2, plus an academy, totalling 6. I am not sure if a
                        non
                        captial city has a slot. But, more or less, you can invest in another city ---which is a good idea to
                        keep
                        science going later-- with those buildings.
                        <br>&emsp;It seems that there are only 7 on the tech tree, then 2 more with literacy and Ulanda. I'd
                        reckon
                        on a basic level, getting 6 is fine, and you can choose the +6 science for exploration or the points.
                        "The
                        attributes are a good investment for your overall build, as they give yields and other effects, and
                        powerfully so as time goes on."

                        Economics is quite powerful, as you tend to reach the starting tier naturally. Also, at 14 reousrces,
                        you
                        get +5 gold for antiquity trade route. You can produce merchants relatively quickly, and improve trade
                        relations to keep adding more. You could do 3 routes with the other 4 civs, totalling 60 gold into
                        exploration.
                        <br>&emsp;Though it is worth remarking, that be it +2 settlements, +1 science per codex, +1 culture per
                        wonder, or the trade route gold, that these cost the two points you've earned to reach them. Which does
                        not
                        always compare to two attribute points.
                        <br>&emsp;Citites have 4 slots, towns have 1. Two cities is 8, 3 towns is 3, that's 11. You can have 3
                        cities for 12, and thus 2 towns for 14, so with 5 settlements, you can near quickly convert to a city
                        and
                        slot in those resources. You need to have that many, but the slots are available. And, quite clearly,
                        you
                        use trade routes to acquire such resources --as empire one's don't count.

                        The
                        third tier of the civics tree has 3 civics that each give a +settlement, and their masteries give a
                        relic.
                        House of Wisdom is fantastic, as it gives 3 relics and slots. From piety, you go to top first civic, and
                        get
                        Hal o Keeve, which gives 3 slots, then The house is the mastery of the next top civic. El Escatol is in
                        the
                        bottom of the tree, and gives 3 slots. Otherwise, you get 1 slot in the palace, and 1 per temple. I
                        would
                        say you can get 1 of the wonders, but unless you go to them directly, their going to go quick. El Escol
                        is
                        more accessible lower in the tree, gives a settlment limit, and 4 happiness per city within 7 tiles.
                        Even
                        then, you'd need to buy 5 temples, to display 5 more.
                        <br>&emsp;I'm noticing that the legacy points are about timing; as you simply need to reach the point,
                        rather than hold it. Gathering relics is much easier, as you have qualifiers via your religion. If you
                        can
                        build a wonder, then save your gold, you can purchase the temples you need near the end of the age, and
                        get
                        your 2 points. That, or you can get +18 culture.

                        religion, or
                        4 if it is captured and follows your religion.
                        <br>&emsp;You get a potential +8 settlement limit, plus any from unique civics. You end antiquity with a
                        ninimum of 4; most civs grant +2 from unique tree, and you also get two +1 from the latter civic tree.
                        Realistically, your going to get one of those, plus irrigation, meaning a minimum of 5, and likely 1
                        from
                        the early unique tree. So 6-8. If settle 9 cities, or less one for each captured, then you can get +2
                        settlment legacy. The potential then is around 15, meaning, that you likely have 6 at home, and thus
                        another
                        6 on distant. Though, there may not be room. Navigating through diplomacy may allow this; for if you
                        ignore
                        positive relations and their upsides, you can give yourself a tolerable means to attack settlements
                        ---those
                        with resources perhaps.
                        <br>&emsp;In fact, considering that you can convert all your cities, you only need 6 settlments to
                        complete
                        the path, and 4 to get the two points ---this gives 10 production to cities, 10 gold to towns in distant
                        lands. If you conquer one city then convert, that's 4, plus 2 more settles. If you take two settlements,
                        plus settle yourself 2, thats a full twelve, and 3 attribute points.

                        So I don't understand how specialist limits are made. But, I know that Education, followd by Urban
                        Planning
                        each give +1 limit. Angkor Watt from antiquity gives a local boost.
                        <br>&emsp;They bascially 1.5x your building adjacencies. So if you have an observatory and univserity
                        between 3 resources, you'll normally get +3 to each, and plus 6 together; each specialist adds 50
                        <br>&emsp;I'm not sure how to get 40 yields, for 5 tiles mind you.
                        <br>&emsp;The bonuses are good though. +3 science per quarter at tier two (or 3 tiles). You likely have
                        3 cities with at
                        least 3 quarters each, which is 27 science. Not to bad. And you may build even more. 4 cities with 4
                        quarters is 48 science.

                        I might describe this pesky notion, so long obscure, as one of collective.
                        <br>&emsp;For one who is attending to their own efforts is no different than those who attend to a
                        country.
                        It's merely a matter of scope; or at least domain of attention. For I may focus here or there, but so do
                        I
                        only have so much. And it is quite easy to say, that people extend their view to matters beyond the
                        commnon
                        realm, into community, nations, society. And indeed, I feel this press, be it form TV or a friend. And
                        their
                        being so outward, 'or collective' as I deem it, rubs me the wrong way. As there is something natural
                        within
                        all of us, a condition; one which only dreams and fancy can paraly. "Yet against wisdom's show, and her
                        proclomation that the reality will not be as you concieve." This is why I care little, nor fret, when
                        I'm
                        occupied, as our path is formed by our dutiful efforts; and we don't even see the realm around. "Nor are
                        we
                        off to do so; as what we see from the right stops of cordial to such rightneous." Whether I should
                        attend to
                        my health, my relations, my job is one thing. But so much as I am, so is my path accordingly carved. And

                        the come and go nature of this, 'as if, be it today or tomorrow, so will I return. And all things I care

                        I like the idea of builds, be it military, or science based, or wonder based. You tend to get rewarded

                        excellig in one area, rather than being average at all. You can be smart and benefit from each side, but

                        <br>&emsp;I can't say which scenario is best in any given time, but I am able to see the choices. Do we
                        befriend or destroy city states. Prepare to fight, or collaborate with other civs. Do we care for
                        culture,
                        or the mere satiety of merchants.

                        So I had my first shift. Well, orientation. My first shift isn't till next week apparently. Though, it
                        can
                        potentially change; as I am to solidify my availability; and Dev is meant to call, or reach out; and I
                        hope
                        there is room for our request.
                        <br>&emsp;Regardless, we went in, after a relatively long walk, made the peering stride to the front
                        desk,
                        and all was easy from there. We spoke with Amber, spoke well, then met Le ne --who I called Le an.
                        Another
                        kid, Logan came in, for overnight bakery. And we sat at the desk all day, went through training videos,
                        set
                        up our accounts. All of it was pretty well, and the workday layout is solid.
                        <br>&emsp;I ran into max and Chanoya simultaneously, and spoke well again. Chanoya is nice, my age, and
                        I
                        think we've got a friend in her.
                        <br>&emsp;I am nervous about our shifts; though, I really just hope that the soul shift next week is
                        true,
                        and not to be changed. "Work tomorrow and Thursday, oh my." But I did hear great news. For one, I can
                        wear
                        any black jacekt or sweatshirt; or something dark grey. And, foremost, I can put my scooter in the
                        department. Opening the door, it's literally right there. "And the new setup is monarchal."
                        <br>&emsp;I just need to confirm. If Dev doesn't call before 6, I'll send an email, confimring our
                        availability and shift.

                        I feel a little but unerved, from our unknown itineray, and food. Coming home, we did a stretch, and all
                        we
                        needed. But when I played Civ, I just couldn't relax and get into it. I just feel like consuming right
                        now,
                        rather than playing. So we'll eat, and assuming our shift is not till next week, we'll work out, eat our
                        protein bowl, and do however else we please. Doing the videos has been great; though, some are not as
                        fitting as I'd like. It does not need to be anything in particular, but rather be made to feel great.
                        "Were
                        not missing things; but odd motions or transitions get in the way of merry goodness."
                        <br>&emsp;It is nice that we don't have to fret about going in. It is great we can scooter, as walking
                        there
                        really irks you into feeling worked. It was fine though. Sitting also wasn't an issue. For the work we
                        were
                        doing it felt rought; but eating really mended the issue. All was good, and I am really just hoping at
                        this
                        point, that our itineray can be light and known. "How funny is it, that these concerns were irrelvant
                        when
                        you were worried about meeting folk. That went off without a hitch. Let's wait for Devs call, and
                        declare
                        that of the shift we got, so are we taking that to be true. And alls good from there."
                        <br>&emsp;Theres also mind you free eye care and dental for everybody. I think 2000 for dental, and 300
                        for
                        glasses. Nice.

                        Running an empire is tough, as there is so much to benefit from, yet only so much you can do.
                        <br>&emsp;The first step is whether or not your going aggressive or not. Similar to liberty or tradition
                        in
                        Civ 5, being a conquer in 7 requires strict and deliberate action. As in all objectives, a fine choice
                        of
                        leader is welcomed. Similar to 5 though, where liberty was more particular, so aggression lies. You may
                        elect, and generally achieve it well: but the choice must be clear.
                        <br>&emsp;Then you must decide whether your going to focus on culture; as so many great wonders lie at
                        the
                        end of that road. As with many choices, choosing the attribute points to accomodate them is essential.
                        In
                        culture's case, and science also, there is an attribute point that gives the corresponding yield per
                        resource. Combining this with Hathshepsut --who gets culture per import-- directs you to code of laws,
                        in
                        order to get merchants.
                        <br>&emsp;Science has no objective claim, other than infastrucuture. But it is generally a good plan, to
                        go
                        animal husbandry and pottery into writing, irrigation for +1 settlement and masonry for monuments and
                        mine
                        production; then into currency for specialists. Bronze working may be sought otherwise; but considering
                        your
                        sim direction, this is more preventative than useful.
                        <br>&emsp;I think the most overlooked element are attribute points. Be it from wonders or mementos,
                        these
                        lead into serious build defining boons. Be it an extra settlement, means for gold or suzerainity, the
                        benefit is clear. Because of this, succeeding in the legacy path holds such potential. As the first tier
                        gives 1 point and so forth for 2 and 3.
                        <br>&emsp;For codexes, you need only need a library, and an academy for tier 2. A second city will give
                        you
                        full completion.
                        <br>&emsp;For economics, you simply need a bunch of merchants and enough cities to slot them. As with
                        most
                        paths, investing amounts to establishing the components of success, then executing on them near the end
                        of
                        an age. For instance, military requires 9 for tier two. You get 4 with irrigation, another 1 or 2 with
                        the
                        top and bottom ends of civics, and usually +1 in your unique civics. That, and besides celebrations,
                        there
                        is no harsh penalty for going overboard. For each one over you get -5 in each city, which can cut down
                        on
                        local yields. -10 though is a mere -10
                        yields. So accomodating for the lack of celebrations and policy slots means that more settlements can be
                        had. For
                        the sake of growth and infastrucutre, so it's your gain. And near the end of the age, you can convert to
                        cities in order
                        to have the resource slots. And for select one's, you can add a library, or an unique quarter. And four
                        wonders is all
                        you need for two points, and two for a basic 1. Numbers wise, 5 self made settlements and 2 captured
                        ones will give the
                        9 you need. Which means you ought reach for 6 settlment cap; bridging between the standard 4 is the goal
                        then, and
                        likely achievable with a unique civic and entertaint/military training. Adjusting your relations so that
                        at the end of
                        an age you can attack a vulnerable city and meet the requirment --a moment will do-- then raze it.
                        <br>&emsp;Regarding cities, there benefit is in adding specialists to your cities. As you only have so
                        many great rural
                        tiles; and generally benefit by urban buildings. Rural tiles allow you to either grow, which only
                        benefits you to
                        acquire more productive tiles, which is only for building. At some point, the limit of your production
                        is past the
                        demands of such buildings; they may not even be available. All you want are more yields from
                        specialists. Towns are
                        helpful then, but only as the specialists are concerned. If your culture and science is solid, and your
                        capital is at 12
                        pop, the food demand is so high that the investment to overt it is not much worth. Your better building
                        your towns,
                        turning them into cities perhaps. An important note, is that you can spexialize towns before turning
                        them into cities.
                        Besides your cap, all settlements revert to towns in exploration and modern. The amount of food you have
                        scales with
                        each, so at some point in the age, the means to grow outweighs what your tech can do. "Similar to +2
                        food to grow in 20
                        turns, versus not growing at all, but for production's sake." In this way, some towns can become cities
                        later in
                        antiquity, or earlier in exploration. You may want quarters or hard yields before beginning in a growth
                        phase. While
                        some towns are made for supporting your growth, and have no need or productive ability to develop beyond
                        that.

                        So theres two sides to our passion, namely, in generosity or reception. In one, I wish to throw myself
                        into
                        something; and as much as I seek, so do the bounds this extend; the other, I ponder over other's view of
                        me,
                        being in awe, or bearing sympathy, 'as I martyr'.
                        <br>&emsp;The point of all our studies seems, to disitinguish these yearning motions, from those which
                        are
                        less reaching, but steady, and at that forward, but through a peaceful place. The subjects remain, as I
                        may
                        see and or grip the world; but not neccessarily out of dreams and hunger, but in feeling, 'as I move

                        I wish to wake up early, hear the birds, see the sun coming into the sky. If I could do this as the
                        first
                        blue entered the night, oh delight. But at the very least, I ought come up during the morn.
                        <br>&emsp;Through the day, I want to walk, scooter, sit and read. Nor do I wish to fret because some
                        nice
                        moment is passing. The evening blue can be seen near or afar, as the setting sun. Do one then the other,
                        in
                        whichever order.
                        <br>&emsp;I want to watch Star Trek, New Girl, Easy Allies and a comforting movie review. There's even a
                        soft joy in Scooby Doo or Arthur. "The calm delight of cartoons."
                        <br>&emsp;Watching movies fairs similar, be it horror, thriller, adventure or a fav.
                        <br>&emsp;I want to play Ark and battleifled, Civ and Diablo, things like the Witcher too.
                        <br>&emsp;I want to read about the Indo Europeans, remark upon nature's simplicity, by learning about
                        the
                        baseness of heat and light. Nor do I wish to catch myself on the brambles of logic or tradition. "I
                        ought
                        only ask."
                        <br>&emsp;This is all trying of me though, in our means of sitting, breathing, exercise and nourishment.
                        Much of what we see as required of us, hold means contrary those listed. "As they are for living."
                        <br>&emsp;But one thing overcomes all, understanding. It mellows my historical view, in how fair and
                        mundane
                        it is: too, the base of our foresight.
                        <br>&emsp;For we do need money, a home, the means to food without scarcity; nor trepidation in our
                        invovlements; and perhaps, as I've learned most of all, not to be so lacking in understanding, as to let
                        ungrounded emotions pull you away from where you'd otherwise establish yourself; wherein the means for
                        friendship, satiety and contribution are made.
                        <br>&emsp;I don't believe in our fears nor apprehension. But there is a past behind us, one which has
                        ladened the imbalances of our passions against our otherwise happy memories. In fact, our current state
                        is
                        such, that our memory is so pleasantly full, that remarking upon anything but seems trivial. Yet life
                        does
                        move on, and our paces are not always on par with such serenity. "Creeping in, the outskirts of
                        tranquility:
                        where the worst seem so, as they are relatively so contrast to this side of the door."
                        <br>&emsp;I'd put it like this. There is a base, of which our heart is best defined. But due to vice and
                        wear, we loose such depth, and bound ourselves from shallower levels. The result, is that we either step
                        far
                        and yonder, 'but with vanity as our gain', or we weep and wallow, 'knowing that our heart truly does not
                        care'.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a buldging effect you see, of all which errodes our tranquility. And we know this,
                        intuitively; by our unacceptence or consent to impressions or beliefs born of 'that buldging base'.
                        That,
                        and by experience, as our bearing of such buldging leads to a relation with the world which is not so
                        based.
                        "As such buldges, in their motions, tend to puff up, as the steps from them alight. But, as we overt
                        ourselves from such strides, the buldge loosens out, and we can sink into ourselves a little. From
                        there,
                        our relation to life is more near and composite --rather than fleeing."
                        <br>&emsp;I've not the time or energy to dispell this, but the grievence in all of this is one of
                        melancholoy. And, for me at least, her retched brother: rancour. As we mentioned, our acceptence of the
                        buldge has never been so. But it is not often absent. The normal response is one, where we act on it, as
                        to
                        be alive, 'however vain'. But in our aversion to that, we tend to pitch ourselves into it. The actions
                        which
                        would be had there been no buldge there, would be like those which step from it: only from a deep and
                        dearer
                        base. "We simply let ourselves sink into that point where we'd begin; like someone who wouldn't proceed
                        with
                        a crooked home: but therein had no roof over there head." And the rains of the world bear upon me in
                        such a
                        sinking state; as she says much in media, and tradition: expressed by folks close and far around.

                        my friend. I know
                        there are two nations far away. We are fortuante in having settlments on the east and west coast, and

                        we need many to
                        hold our relics. Those are less a priority, as we can get a lay of the land, choose a reliquary, and get
                        the relices we
                        can. Having two cities focused on hard yields works great in Antiquity; we need at least another.

                        line, and potentially buy some fortified districts. Our captial is fairly protected by a two tile lane,

                        When we were young, we shy'd away from the effort required 'to grow up'. I can't say I found the ends
                        convincing, nor was my scenario in life such, that doing it anyway in our capacity; as it still felt
                        tough.
                        <br>&emsp;As this went on, and depression ensued, along with some naievety, we landed on a personal
                        scale;
                        one in which our duties turned to ourself, and for ends made of this.
                        <br>&emsp;I took this to be quite extreme, as the year or so prior, I had just simply aversed myself to
                        anything 'long term'; or when I had, I realized that my efforts were in fact not effective for so ---and
                        this brought much depression. But upon caring for myself, namely in health and study, I found much
                        strength
                        in doing so. And so I amended to do this exclusively, with no sense of anything other. Till this time,
                        my
                        relations were sparse, and my time was spent mostly alone. This had been the color of our way through
                        recent
                        years, 'but in receding, from times that reached great company, to the outskirts of a few friends'. In
                        my
                        mind, I would never go to school, marry, have children, nor be invovled in the world --as my dreams
                        confessed. All I could see was a road ahead baked in self regard: in it's gains and propiety.
                        <br>&emsp;My reverence for this did not sway, but our idea of such ends, or abscence of common ones, did
                        come to pass. And so I tried to incorporate myself into such world. I was much more confident than I'd
                        ever
                        been, but connecting with folk was tough. I'd say the only advent I showed, was that despite clinging to
                        little (in terms of the common way), I did not proceed with no other end in mind. Whereas the time prior
                        I
                        had meekly tried to 'be so invovled', but upon failing, shrunk feebly into myself, so in this case I
                        deliberately overted, and choose our personal path. It was not so fashioned as the norm, but did at
                        least
                        have some momentum to it. It held much of our personal regard as the aim, but did so while being
                        occupied
                        and with company.
                        <br>&emsp;In this, I was but confidently bored. The job I had was unremarkable, and felt quite
                        demanding.
                        Nor was our time at home lush and pleasant. Fueld by dreams, but simply admitted by our percieved
                        ability,we
                        choose to move from home. Doing so felt liberating, as we held no heat from the past and any of her
                        expecations. What we go was fun and the right to truly be.
                        <br>&emsp;Only, what this right permitted was not of anything whole and solid, but a vision, a yearning.
                        We
                        never acted on this though, and reached a similar point prior to our move; where we were more or less
                        happy
                        and stable, but missing something. And because our life was still more personally arranged than with fun
                        and
                        company, so did this basic life weigh down on me.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, our simple ways were full of self regard and activity which sprouted from it. We
                        never
                        drank, smoke only with regret, slept, exercised and ate with diligence and fortuity; and all to an end
                        in
                        which literature, entertainment and natural love blossomed. But in this state, we were unerved by
                        outside
                        responsability, namely work. And from this, mixed with adolescent confidence and rooted naievities (from
                        drugs and 'artistic illusion -of glory') I dreamt and (more or less) expected for such chains to wain.
                        Across the world I'd thought we go, or to the big city nearby. But this was never true; and our hopefull
                        wains remained by our idle side.

                        The most honest statement I can make, is that the prescence of a condition primes one for seeking
                        happiness;
                        as the weight around, however muted, still holds one in place; and thus encourages, and as much as the
                        duty
                        is right to oblige, warrants, the harvest from such amends.
                        <br>&emsp;But what if sloth's drained my mind, and through the comfort of our times, or broadly
                        speaking,

                        demand, or self regarded ones, where freshness is heralded (in freedom even), you still see the
                        continuity
                        of such ways, be it in health or reflection; and too, of death, illness, fortune and progeny: so their
                        coming place is seen."
                        <br>&emsp;I guess the fairest response, is that had your affairs caught up to something suitable, that
                        so
                        would you neccessarily be more conditioned, and by that, rightfull clear in how you oblige and benefit.
                        Even
                        if that stability was small, so would it be near and in your grasp. I contend that beyond our means for
                        living, and removing the pointed aims of our past affections, that the means for children are not
                        exhorbidant, if your wish for them is to live as well as you seek; and thus, for an end which bears
                        simplicity as a facilitator. Nor is death and illness but a lingering threat, and one, in all eveness,
                        holds
                        no remores or despair in your rightfully common state.
                        <br>&emsp;Maybe there's just not enough I'd like to do. Perhaps theres too many cloudy days, nor any
                        cemented impetus to remain healthy and pure, as to feel even the suttlest lights (of the sun and all
                        common
                        things). As it were, my younger years of self-obsession were solitary, in that those around me --similar
                        to
                        me even-- lived via a direction --regarding work, love and fun-- that remarked problems I did not have.
                        And
                        so too their desires, did they surround. Our abscence of such problems, via a mix of meakness and
                        maturity,
                        felt friction from said desires; nor was I too comfortable being aruond those who felt either afraid or
                        emboldened against issues I did not have: or even humoured.
                        <br>&emsp;Why is it though, I'd say, that writing letters is so warming, reassuring, enlivening? Does it
                        give you a foothold in the world? And one which is based on your feet? "Compared to those who are
                        steadily
                        seeped in tradition?"
                        <br>&emsp;Maybe the proper thing to submitt, is that the reason I am off, or at least the thing which
                        has me
                        posing these questions, is that of the minor duties and personal tasks, which, upon execution, would
                        give me
                        a calm and rigorous lust, that so are these hard to do; and so I look for reasons why, and at that,
                        relations with others --through writing and letters-- who feel similarly. "For none, from what I've
                        gleamed,
                        who are worth any esteem or recognition, did so based on some disicpline or quest, but rather the honest
                        submission to doing the right things; things which were relatively simple, but held increasingly little
                        room
                        to ignore or be contradicted." In all of our lives, we live amidst those without such submission: what
                        they
                        do strike at, I can not say. But there is a deliberate, if not percieved air of contrition on their
                        part: as
                        our own submission was phony, or worth contempt. That, and they hold no postive enforcement, or at that
                        pleasure --in that you'd happily share your efforts with someone, beyond the increased ability by their
                        prescence.

                        So I say, in private, but also with much solid reflection (of an empirical sort), that the needs of
                        children
                        are not fundementally different than yours; and considering what I need, so is there a small sum. And as
                        for
                        expectation and grace, of what's contemporary I will make us of and appreciate, but for traditin, or at
                        least that which is established, I will fairly rest on. "As there are taxes and roads, so are there, in
                        most
                        countries, moderate allowances for glasses and dental; plus a sufficient means for healthcare. Places
                        where
                        this is not so, are more unique than those who provide it."
                        <br>&emsp;My better times could 'be in the trenches' so to speak, with such a notion, and by that say
                        more,
                        but I have found much peace in the notion 'that people can handle themselves', be it in war, crime or
                        depravity. We hold no fear or rancour regarding illness, so why not those? Like a parent, I am ready to
                        let
                        my children go; and realize that it is me, in all our fright and garulity, 'that we picture and or
                        imagine
                        horrible things happenings; and that those suffering, do so with helpless agony and despair'. Yet, if we
                        look at ourself, and those 'whose selves' were privy too, so is the user, or subject to any experience,
                        not
                        so as your mind leads you to believe. And I compare it to being in a passenger seat of a car, and going
                        quite fast, and you have a sort of tense constriction at each halt and bump; and all the likely because
                        you
                        are not the one driving. But if you reflect on your own time driving, and thus what the driver in this
                        case
                        is in resemblence of, you know that the process of stearing and accelerating is almost effortless, and
                        worthy of no fright. "And it is by counts, a soul mark of me, that had I been in someone elses shoes, I
                        would not feel as I imagine them to be feeling."

                        Tradition is but a farther stamp of memory. For you father tells you how to live, as reflects his
                        experience. And the bare notion, is that as I have lived, so will the world remain; and as such, ought
                        you
                        live in accordance with what I've learned ---as the arean has not changed. Tradition is but a longer
                        mark of
                        people's response; in that, of the world and how she's been, so are the deepest elements continually
                        dealt
                        with. "Giving tradition her guise of wisdom: as she shows what is most important to attend to."
                        <br>&emsp;I say this, for one's condition, as come or present, is quite obvious in it's effects. One
                        hungers
                        for food and warmth; or feels stress when their offspring have to little --by what they can afford.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, it seems that all but what could happen, and has not yet been experienced by you or
                        anyone past --who may then impart it--- is all that lies as any unclear concern. For imagine a deep
                        breathe
                        and how well it calms you; and then imagine a parched breathe, in which your left wanting more. This
                        reflects a balance already in motion; and if you were in the state of the former, so would you be in
                        pains
                        abscence --or whatever the abscence of breathe would effect. It is possible that such satiety will
                        change,
                        and an even deeper breathe is required, or more. But therein lies tradition, or the past rather, telling
                        of
                        'the breathes which have been satisfying, and their aptness to change'. Literature, or study, can tell
                        one
                        of how things have been across millenia. While the words of your father can bear sense of the common
                        path of
                        a man; in that, of his breathe, so has a good one been fine; nor was there a ever a needed change. You
                        may
                        not be like him, or perhaps the enviroment currs effects. But at least on the face of it, the air here
                        is
                        more or less equal to the air there, and anywhere: and your mere ability to breathe, and perhaps well,
                        satisfies the point. "If this is not forseen to change, then one can be both filled and by that stable,
                        nor
                        with remorse at the current calm, as if it was bound to change. One's confidence during a task brings a
                        comparable cheer, in that being ordained to something brings little stress when your means to it is
                        beyond
                        capable. While someone asked to hit a target --and with an importance to do so--- sweats a little when
                        they
                        feel the loosness of their string."

                        This may be saying too much, but the most important remark of all is in the disparity between the past
                        and
                        new experience. For what is good, or to be concerned with, holds it's prevalence by a minimum degree,
                        from
                        what has so far come. Our very prescence as people suggests there was someone who gave birth to us. And,
                        as
                        such, as you worry about your friends, or the world, so do those who came before wish for you to do
                        well;
                        and by that, reference what that means, and how it is achieved (or imposed against) based on what has
                        come
                        so far for them. "It is odd then when they grow up believing something to be a certain way, then, by the
                        broadest degree, a new discovery is made; and so are we all parsed to update our amends."
                        <br>&emsp;Where my thoughts are going though, is more along the lines of acquiring new experience. For
                        if
                        one is struggling, to breathe we'll say, or to meet a certain itinerary, they tend not to notice, or be
                        eligble if they did, when it comes to new experiences: perhaps new itineraries. "I find, in principal,
                        that
                        this is why people enjoy sunsets during a vacation; as they are by definition not so occupided, and thus
                        notice it, and relish."

                        Saying what things are is a great remedy to chimeric dispair; as the impression that something is a
                        certain
                        way, but of a glaring, disorted kind, makes one grind up against it, 'as not to let the illusion in'.
                        But
                        when one here's rumour of a ghost, they pay little attention, 'as the oddity is quite clear'.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I say that twitter, for instance, is nothing more than a forum. Nor is Amazon
                        different
                        than a marketplace. In one you shop alone, whereas a literal market may see you interspersed with folk.
                        But,
                        amidst the common grounds, be it in a market or the public square, there may be spots where people
                        actually
                        mingle and discusss. Politically, there are places strictly set for this. Online forums are merely this
                        in
                        the public realm; though, the government does include itself when it announces something. By the advent
                        of
                        radio and broadband, the forum in which people engage is from any point that such waves are recieved.
                        This
                        contrasts the literal forums of governance; where the correspondance is done in physical rooms.
                        <br>&emsp;A news broadcast, or radio station, are really just channels which others can tune into. The
                        difference from online media being that in those, the activity is one of converse, 'in that you post,
                        comment or reply'; while in broadcasts, or of those who do more than interact with that which is made,
                        are
                        merely putting organized expressions onto the air. Be it for education or entertainment, profit or fun,
                        they
                        are using the waves as means of output; no different than those put out their own response. "Perhaps its
                        fair that we grant the format of this as a sort of design, as to house and parlay expressions and
                        response:
                        each though, being an upload, or use of the wave: for in the latters case, they are still outputing
                        their
                        own expression, even if it was spurred by someone elses."

                        you set yourself at a point where things with a bothersome nature appeal to you; or better said, you

                        can
                        control that: ought I merely be aware of them not doing so, but for my own benefit: as none expect, nor
                        even
                        claim ability, to notify someone of another's poor driving. "There's little communication on the road."
                        <br>&emsp;Similarly, if a rabbit hops along, or a family of racoons, there is nothing I can do, nor feel
                        responsible for, in whether they are fed, or experience the risk of traffic. I ought not shue them or
                        interfer. But, man is part of nature's garden, 'and I ought not fret if some bug gets trapped by a
                        spider'.
                        And it is quite nice to breathe in this sentiment, as it puts the emphasis on a possibility which I am
                        not,
                        to a large degree, concerned with, and rightly so. But, in doing so, the sorrow I feel is at the very
                        least
                        not one of venom and spite: as if the spiders are mean and wicked, 'seeking to blunder the interests of
                        their prey'. "Accidents are the perrils of most, in that each goes their way, looking for what nature
                        provides: but in that, albeit sometimes butting heads, generally fair no evil beyond the point they
                        collide." The injuries of those in Botswana are not, in those respects, my concern.

                        So this is not some obscure notion needing clarity, but a useful one to divulge.
                        <br>&emsp;Simply, we spend so much time balancing our accounts, making sure the income is fair, and that
                        our
                        expenditure is solide. And I am not making the point that such matters are false. Rather, I am trying to
                        say, that comparativley, we little effort (of the same sort) when it comes to the balance of our lives.
                        <br>&emsp;What this amounts to is neither here nor there. It ultimately comes down to remarking upon
                        your
                        actual duties and pleasures, cares and fears; and tailoring these as to make them smooth, as we'd want
                        with
                        our finances.
                        <br>&emsp;Where this comes to pass, is that most folk, be it in passing or close nearby, make judgements
                        about our ways: be it in finance or our lives. I find that in both, little is actually well-placed, 'as
                        if
                        one thought I was being exhorbident, when in fact a larger pot of gold would not even make a dent'.
                        Especially though is this the case in our lives. For I believe that few elements of it are accounted for
                        because we presume what they should be; nor, of the things which we grant recogition, do we also grant
                        much
                        worth of attention, 'in part because we deem it out of our control'.
                        <br>&emsp;And so, when you recieved scrutiny or encouragment regarding expenses, but with not basis in
                        how
                        your finances are --via ignorance, or innaccuracy--- that so does this occur with even more prominence
                        when
                        it comes to course and conduct of our lives: where the remarks made on grounds even less resembling to
                        how
                        we are.

                        Were drawn to things in an open way, just as we close ourselves off, in the sense that we stiffen, for
                        things were averse to.
                        <br>&emsp;But the process of action, whereby our openeness or closedness progresses, is whole in part of
                        the
                        'becoming open'. For, in a negative sense, it is not so much the consumption of sugar which derails me,
                        but
                        the progression of our body from the state it was prior, and heading, to the one it is now and heading;
                        whereby it softens, yet also stiffens. And nothing, by these counts, is good or bad, but causal of
                        effects,
                        or in other word processes.
                        <br>&emsp;Consider kinetics and a body of molecules. Adding energy will cause them to move more, and
                        further
                        bounce around. All that occured though, was that some accompanying bounces (the energy) were added,
                        causing
                        the others to also bounce (via the effect of collisions). A mere process, rather than a change.
                        <br>&emsp;This is a very literal way of viewing your actions, as you care not so much about ends, but of
                        the
                        procession which certain actions have. "Hangovers don't cause pain, but delays; as you more than likely
                        return to how you were; perhaps inclined to pause again, or proceed as if it didn't happen."
                        <br>&emsp;By this, it is fair to account for the entwined effects already upon us, be it in breathing,
                        posture, eating and stress.

                        So there are aims in Civ 7, and as regards legacy paths, wonders and skill points --along with buildings
                        and
                        tech-- I can't say I entirely know.
                        <br>&emsp;But there are strategies you can take, e.g, pairing Hatshepsut and her +1 culture per imports,
                        with Aksums early means of trade, and +2 culture and gold on trade routes. This is a fantastic approach
                        early on.
                        <br>&emsp;But then you go into the exploration era, and the direction's change. You keep the culture on
                        imports, and all of Aksums traditions, but your current civ may not have such emphasis. Better put,
                        there
                        are no civs which strictly build off your's prior, but rather offer new ways to achieve success. You may
                        maintain the element of trade, while also focusing on something else. Playing as Spain for instance,
                        allows
                        for tons of growth and dominance over sea. This can naturally pair with trade. Or you can play as Inca,
                        and
                        hold more of a tall, growth oriented playstlye; which also holds room for trade. Or, the Abbassid, who
                        actually benefit greatly from trade, while also having a hearty means for science and specialists.

                        I am in this spot, where the idea of being open, is all I've meant to exclaim.
                        <br>&emsp;Yet, there's a contrasting force, spurred in time by a mix of desire and fear: the ego, as
                        they
                        call it.
                        <br>&emsp;For in our growing years, our openess could not be fully achieved, and thus, by the load of
                        our
                        condition, we instated rewards, and depleted fears. While now, having reached a mix of stable freedom,
                        we
                        are not so drawn to such rewards, but to rather be as we abily are. "For we need no promise, or remedy
                        of
                        other's concern."
                        <br>&emsp;Fear though runs down my side, as the common frets of others act like debris from a fire,
                        'clouding our judgement, or sinjing us as it wofted over'.
                        <br>&emsp;In a weird way, we've learned so much about the world, as our illusory consumption of it felt
                        to
                        pressed upon; in that, if we wished to substantiate our freedoms, so could we not rest with the
                        perceived
                        assumptions around. That violene was how it was portrayed in film, or that the world was woddled about
                        as
                        gleamed by pithy press conferences. I felt myself ignorant of such things, and feeling like 'my innate
                        knowledge and fair experience' could not suffice, 'against the simply and world contentions of others'.
                        "I
                        was not free to be sympathetic or concerned myself." So I read memomoirs, tightened our historical lane,
                        and
                        by that, gave levity to our balanced impressions of the world. "For the root in all of this, was that I
                        could state more clearly how the world was, in regards to violence and depravity: and this gave the
                        truer
                        complexion, of red strands on a grand garmet."
                        <br>&emsp;These red stains though, only appear mild when the garmet is clear. Which is why, in our view
                        of
                        media things, 'the world appears on fire: as the garmet presented is at least 1 size too small.'
                        <br>&emsp;Thereby I stand, wondering what to do. As I see that our disturbance of such impressions, is
                        more
                        to do with the belief by others, 'in that they feel that such garmet (as viewed) is true'.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am left standing, is in the near abscence of threat, 'as their ardent view that the
                        world
                        is ending merely perturbs their ability to speak on more common matters: as simple spending and budgets
                        are
                        pillaried against the broader demise." Despite this being a little unpractical, and despairing by mere
                        sentiment, the real blurr is that, besides these edges, there is in fact nothing of concern for me. "As
                        we
                        are either positively accepted and flourishing, or are neutrally regarded, and more or less upright by
                        our
                        own means, to the same degree.There are but little embers and tuffs of negativity."
                        <br>&emsp;The question then, with, mind you, the consent to potential contraiety in needing to ask,
                        'what,
                        upon freedom, ought one do'?

                        several servings left. Kale is good, few bananas, full berries. Haven't been eating bread, but theres
                        E.muffins (frozen too). No peanuts though, and only roasted almonds. A little sunflower seeds.
                        <br>&emsp;Were making trailmix for tomorrow, grinding up kale, Cranberries, almonds/peanuts and
                        sunflower
                        seeds. Something whole for lunch, likely banana. We'll scooter somewhere, sit, and read.
                        <br>&emsp;Were working next friday, same time (9-530). I cannot recall exactly, but working out the
                        third
                        morning prior, 'so two full days and on the third day, prior to work', allows for a good rest and follow
                        through into work. We did that this week, on Wedensday, then Saturday, and I feel swell. This break is
                        longer, so we'll want to aim for a workout on Tuesday. Imagine right now, we worked on Friday, when
                        you'd
                        workout again. Probally tomorrow.
                        <br>&emsp;I would like to spend some time organizing yoga, a little cutting, if not arranging seated,
                        standing, back etc.
                        <br>&emsp;We can put our shoes on 840. Get up around 8. Not sure if I'd like to shower or not, but I
                        will
                        tonight for sure. Shoes are pretty good. We need to do some laundry though. Maybe we'll shower now,
                        clean
                        up, do laundry, then either shower tonight, tomorrow morning, or not at all. Brushing and flossing is
                        more
                        important.

                        So I met Reza today, who is the assistant to Dev. He was quite nice, a litte forward, but not in fact
                        stern.
                        I met another girl Kendra, solum and pretty, who was speaking with Reza twice; and I found it
                        interesting
                        that he was prodding her to come in on her off day, and she was laughing with him in defiance. This
                        really
                        showed how familiar they were with eachother, and how he, despite being the boss, was not in any way
                        mean,
                        or grumpy. She and I actually spoke for a moment, and had as fair a connection as one'd expect.
                        <br>&emsp;At first I met Morgan, who showed me in and where to put my scooter; he gave me a ridiculous
                        yellow coat, then left.
                        <br>&emsp;Sam was the first person I really met. She was a concierge leader, and one of those go-to
                        department workers. "A sort of funnel between all things." Another guy (long haired) named Josh came in,
                        and
                        he was seemingly her equal. He was nice, and depsite my passing remarks (while working), he was quite
                        kind
                        and amiable. She was easy to talk to, and responded to some levity regarding work.
                        <br>&emsp;To my happy surprise, Joey was still there. I only saw him for a moment, but it was great to
                        see
                        him. Alex, who I at first forgot, was also there.
                        <br>&emsp;Then I met Mozhjan, or Moji, who ran orders with me most of the day. She was from Iran, and we
                        spoke the most out of anybody. She was sweet, calmy earnest, and not dumb in her lack of english. We had
                        a
                        very pure co-worker connection, 'in that I shared a bit about my family'. She's just one of those people
                        who
                        is polite and pleased to see you, and says fairwell.
                        <br>&emsp;Kiana was a girl I had seen while shopping. "Big and Beautiful, but curvier rather than large
                        --as
                        some of the women are." She was hispanic though, or at least ethnic --by her accent. I passed her while
                        picking, introduced myself, and felt on par with her through the day. A similar thing happened with
                        Kendra.
                        What tends to happen, is that certain girls are hard to connect with, and you just don't speak with
                        them. Be
                        it nerves or interest, this just occurs. So it was nice to acquaint myself with her, as I wasn't stuck
                        in
                        this awkward abscence. "Much better to be familiar and absent." There was a girl named Swatee, who was
                        quiet, persia and somewhat pretty, but of a rustic sort. Same thing; introduced myself, 'and asked my
                        how
                        lunch was later on'. Great to be on par with everyone as such.
                        <br>&emsp;Vernon was working with Sam, and he was nice and helpful. Some guys like him can be kinda
                        duds,
                        but he for a moment showed interest in me, asking about our first day. Simple and uprigth.
                        <br>&emsp;Austin was in my view the weakest worker. He went slow, sat near the desk and checked his
                        phone.
                        Didn't seem interested in helping.
                        <br>&emsp;There was an older lady, who I blandly said hello to. She was Farenzah.
                        <br>&emsp;Then Audi came in, and he seemed quiet, but then talked with Kendra, so I thought more of him.
                        A
                        young guy named nick came in, and at first I thought him a bit high on his briches. He was sick, but was
                        more or less kind to me as we ran orders. He and Audi were young buds, and Josh too. But this was more
                        from
                        commonality, which I lacked. I asked Audi about his name, as I thought it was abi, and he was good to
                        me.
                        <br>&emsp;Started my shift at 9, having left near 12 minutes prior. Started running orders right away,
                        and
                        things were a bit slow. At 1030 I got to go for a pick, which showed our ricketyness, but also the
                        greatness
                        of picking. At 1230 we went for a break, brought our scooter merrily through the store, went home, sat
                        for
                        12 or so minutes then came back. We had lost our bag, and thus spent a few minutes before leaving, so
                        the
                        whole ordeal could have been much quicker. And it is near effortless to come back and be ready. After
                        that,
                        I had not eaten much, but the time went by relatively smooth. Not to busy, talked rather firmly with
                        Moji.
                        At 340 we went for lunch, and this is where I really noticed not being able to stretch. We do have the
                        option of taking two fifteens, potentially near 4 in this case, and at 230 prior. Depends if were
                        picking,
                        but having a quick bite of trail mix, then going for a stretch, seems to hold us up amidst our ware and
                        despondence. After our break the day seemed over, but a forever off. Then it got busy, and tiredly, we
                        worked through the hour. No one was there, so I left through the door, and have somewhat of a headache.
                        We
                        work on Friday, same time, and would like to get a workout in on Tuesday. Our cheescake hangover did not
                        help us, and the asbcence of stretching and a bungled first break, made evaerything more weary and
                        unsure.
                        Even our feeling going in was one where we did not know how to enter. Now we have a fob, can more or
                        less
                        leave our things with our scooter, or at least prepare what we want at home. We can take water with us
                        on a
                        pick, and although Devs tolerance is not understood, as Reza's is, I am with little doubt that we
                        could't
                        through a headphone on. I didn't sob without it, as the course of our day was such that it was with
                        meaning
                        itself, 'rather than some burdened means'

                        Many of my apprhensions come from our proximity to family. As their attitudes always saturate our own,
                        'while that of others tends to slide off'. Were too attached, and by that, subject to their prevalence
                        and
                        authority.
                        <br>&emsp;But this is more of circumstantial problem, rather than an enditement to our deepest way. As I
                        tend not, in our own studies, in all their wonder and breadth, to see anything as I do, when sparked by
                        ardent viewpoints, or glances at the news. It so happens that these things come up, and principially, we
                        cannot rest with these absent of mind. "For there mere prescence tugs at me." This is what I don't care
                        for,
                        but indeed it raises the question, or point rather, what ought I do.
                        <br>&emsp;For I believe somewhat, that if we weren't exposed to these things, that we'd move through the
                        world more or less positively. As only our own problems would be of concern. "And the world would not be
                        so
                        visible otherwise, as we were more content and set on things near and local."
                        <br>&emsp;Because we are at home though, and to some extent, with folk who helm themselves similarly, it
                        seems that we are endowed to properly be, 'as opposed to enjoying some of our peacefull bliss'. For I do
                        not
                        know what to do, or which feelings and aims are built on strong grounds, rather than unfit passion. My
                        reflections only suggest, and not without blood on the scalpel.
                        <br>&emsp;In other words, we may live as seems fitting, whereby the oddity of worldy joy, mixed with the
                        awkward abscence of any according regard, feels worn by the gormet astutness of the news. "As if other
                        people, in being so squished in it's shallows, sit as though they are so invovled with such matters."
                        Our
                        massive approach tends to give us much reproach, nor any natural elation at the sparks from a fire
                        across
                        the coutnry, or world. Again, this is without disturbance, as being on the softer end of this, however
                        fine
                        at heart, leaves me somewhat perturbed at the things people are watching, and otherwise resentfull of
                        their
                        apparent ardence towards it. This makes me feel like our broader view must be firmer, otherwise we are
                        to
                        accept their view, and the authority at that; or feel ignorant and or blissfully reproached from things.
                        But
                        this removes our worldy love and wonder; and in many ways, sucks all the air out of our enormuos balloon
                        ---from our studies and reflection.
                        <br>&emsp;There's this natural lift which comes from someone well read, but not so pasisonalty or
                        irritably
                        involved. Glory, relief and fame can sprout from this, in our passionate state; but so in our firmer
                        strides
                        lies those greens of openess, 'where we merely see, and with rest proceed, to the things we see; in
                        craft,
                        leisure, honor and liberty'.
                        <br>&emsp;Yet, without the preface of this ending with the flairs bade by passion, it is not clear how
                        we
                        will ever be anything at all. And this ends up making the world feel either far, dangerous and chaotic,
                        or
                        as we truly see, but in need of definement. "This is itself a sort of bare passion, as if we need to
                        assert
                        the path were on."
                        <br>&emsp;Ultimatley I do not know what to do. For, with some vice, we deem the world well; and of its
                        parts
                        which are not, our view of such does not resemble the actual bits and pieces of such portion; nor is it
                        ultimately my concern. "I cannot stop the warlords of Africa, nor those stricken by aids." Where I
                        somber
                        then, is that this natural gait, in which the pithy troubles of modern life are not pouted over, and I
                        distance myself from ignoring the real troubles, while admitting our vast inability in terms of them, so
                        does our relatively free and privalged place within such comparison, leave with it (from some passion) a
                        view and claim, which is somehwhat genersous, but otherwise dear and pleasing. "I believe this is but
                        our
                        own point down the common lane."
                        <br>&emsp;But here lies the conflict. That such a view, where the good was what I plainly recieved, is
                        in
                        fact not so just; as, we don't genuinely have it, 'for it does not lead to anything beyond ourselves, as
                        being truly free would, as you'd be open.
                        <br>&emsp;In total, I have no remorse for our guilt, but rather an isolated despair, at the pungent
                        critiques of the world, 'as if it were truly that way, or at least encapsulated by said critiques'. For
                        when
                        I am open, it is in the world, and as such, my relevant contribution to it in whole, is proportionate in
                        time as the effect is aimed in weight. But if I am not so open, or at least impressed by the critiques I
                        see, that far off lane, 'in which our life is arranged to the world', does not hold its clarity, 'but
                        instead get's swarmed with those saturated views'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt that our energy is to low to inquire and mend, the core trouble in my life: which
                        is,
                        the thin protests against the world, 'and the restless fear and contempt for it, plus the hollow
                        judgements
                        born from its critique', bring reasonable doubt, but also a solitary aversion, 'as if I didn't have to
                        energy to be even somewhat better than them, as even that felt some poor', that I am curbed to a private
                        progress, 'in which our doubts are ironed out, and our flatness becomes a memory, amidst a cheerful and
                        sensible constance'.

                        Ancient wise, Hanging garens is the first solid wonder. It gives an expansionist point, which combined
                        with
                        a memento, can give you growth to cities, or food on your warehouses. That, and if you get another
                        point, be it fron events or military legacy,
                        you can get extra pop in towns, or refund growth from specialists. This takes time to come online
                        though; and if I knew
                        that I'd only get the third point by exploration, then my choice would be less clear. You can play As
                        Ibnatta, and
                        automatically get the growth; withtou the Gardens even, and then, upon doing so, get the third perk. The
                        requirments are
                        simple, next to a river, and good for adj.
                        <br>&emsp;Gate of All Nations is a must, as it is not often contended, relatively cheap when you buy,
                        and essentially
                        gives you +2 strenght in all wars. Combining this with the first point in Military, gives +3.
                        <br>&emsp;Petra is solid for desert and not much else. Pyramids require nav.river and desert, but do
                        upgrade all rivers
                        pretty well.
                        <br>&emsp;Emille Bell is almost never built, and is quite excellent; especially with Ben Franklin. It
                        acts as farmers
                        market but for your captial. Maybe the value is low relative to what you need once you get it in
                        mid-antiquity, but
                        still. Must be built on rough terrain though. The diplo point is solid, as you should aim to get the 25
                        off endevours. It is the 2nd one mind you, so paired with a memento, and your diplomatic yields come
                        much easier.
                        <br>&emsp;I'm not into happiness, as I tend not to go over settlement limit. My understanding is that
                        the penalty is
                        more of a local one; as the broader neagtion to celebrations is unimportant: as you generally have
                        enough policy slots:
                        many of which use novel policies.
                        <br>&emsp;Weiyang palace is fantastic but often conteseted. Requires grassland.
                        <br>&emsp;Pyramid of the Sun is solid, giving culture per quarter. But comes late in the tech tree.
                        <br>&emsp;HaMongi gives food and culture to fishing boats, so good for coastal starts.
                        <br>&emsp;Colossus and Monks mound give resource capacity, which is novel.
                        <br>&emsp;Angkor Wat allows an extra specialist in your capital, which is fantastic. The colossus and
                        monks mound are
                        more contested than this, but it does eventually go. The Khmer get it early though.
                        <br>&emsp;So, in antiquity, besides the terrain wonders, you've got Emille Bell for captial food,

                        Angkor for specialists, Colossus for resource capacity, Hanging Gardens for expansioist point and some
                        growth, gate of

                        arms is perhaps not essential.
                        Theres a spot for Colossus north of us.
                        <br>&emsp;I see a Hawilt center next to our capital, with room for 4 surrounding it. Colouss will touch
                        two. We could
                        remove 1 Hawilt for a solid urban tile (adj. to coast), but there is another one south of us. Though the
                        difference is 3
                        compared to 6.
                        <br>&emsp;So we'll put the Pyramids south, where we'd otherwise put the food. It's a good adj.
                        <br>&emsp;The Madrasa gets adj. from quarters and science buildings, so having this next to our villa
                        quarter and
                        science quarter would do well. The mosque gives adj. for happiness buildins, and gives culture and
                        happiness for
                        wonders. So if petra and pyramids are attached to this quarter, the adjacency will be large. I am also
                        keen to make the
                        Tomb of Askia, which need only be on desert. Petra is also not essential, but a solid benefit.

                        <br>&emsp;Not too much here. Askia is essential if you have a desert tile, and Notre Dame is awsome. It
                        is
                        in the top end of the tree, so going to it directly is important.

                        So just a little bit of a brainstorm, but were settled on a long nav. river, with a upper spli, and
                        minor
                        river to the side. There's several rough tiles nearby, a silver, a wine, a dyes far off, and two gypsum
                        tiles right outside my door.
                        <br>&emsp;I reckon were on the north end of the world, so I ought plana south west and east expand, and
                        one
                        directly south, and a city in between. The nav river and wine will give me some happiness, so I can
                        hopefully go 1 overboard. 4 settles that is.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of layout, the gypsum are on the opposite side of the nav. river. And, to be clear,
                        the
                        fork beside it is a minor one, but still one no less. This is a perfect pyramids, and thus step to
                        masonry.
                        A brickyar would do great, and, keeping it simply, a granary would fit beside it --for warhouses.

                        So I had a really solid game, but kinda got burdened by wonders. Their great, but not even incredibly
                        so. A
                        single Pyramids would have added 5 or 6 production, which wasn't even anything we needed. We could get
                        that
                        from a barracks.
                        <br>&emsp;Remarking upon the early wonders is nice, but unessential. Its better to remember that late
                        game
                        wonders are what we need.
                        <br>&emsp;We ought look for a culture spot, a Ulema spot, and a science spot.
                        <br>&emsp;The Hawilt gives adjency to monument and altar, meaning terribly high specialist count.
                        Perhaps in
                        just antiquity though. But still, we can boost it nicely.
                        <br>&emsp;I just feel like worrying about the things you have which could be oppertune, and not what
                        clear
                        oppertunities you have, is a problem. As you only have so much time and effort; and military is
                        required,
                        along with time to set up trade routes. The production will come, and not in a requisite way from
                        wonders:
                        we have enough if we can build them. For, we need to clear barbs, fortify our cities, get our civics up
                        and
                        progress. Five production from pyramids and petra is too little for the investment, and worry. If the
                        start
                        demands it, sure. But rememebr, navigable rivers are only for fishing boats, and our build cares too
                        little
                        for them. We want woodcutters and sawpits, or brickyards and mines. Growth will come, but is only needed
                        to
                        get key resources and our production going.

                        So we settled on the east coast, more or less above the equator. We've got a strong capital and nearby
                        city,
                        each with several wonders and quarters. A bit north lies a small town, aimed at feeding my capital and
                        adding camels.
                        <br>&emsp;Further south lies two prominent settles, and one recent one. The farthest one is made to
                        access
                        trade routes with Napolean and Hoze, while our nearer one holds gold, silver and two cotton.
                        <br>&emsp;Since we are playing as Abbassid, our aim is to build high adjacency Ulem. It gets benefits
                        from
                        adjacent science buildings, quarters, along with culture and happiness buildings, and wonders of course.
                        We've got Angkor Wat, plus an available specialist growth perk (from our military expansionist point). I
                        believe we have three gold, culture, two science and at least 1 wildcard slot. My aim with economics is
                        to
                        give towns an extra capacity, so they grow..
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of settling, I am keen to reach the islands at sea. At least 3 settlements will do,
                        and
                        relatively close. Having room to build out, and potentialy reach the far lands is oppertune for our
                        trades,
                        but seeing as the sea will fill with other's settlements, the amount of trade will be high --- our
                        mainland
                        will be near full accessible.
                        <br>&emsp;Because of this, I want our current 2nd city to become a city as soon as possible, as it is
                        aimed
                        at the Ulem and its great person. "I don't want my capital having to worry about building that."
                        Similarly,
                        I'd like a third city on the mainland, so that I can build merchants and military if need be. Some salt
                        would serve us nice here.
                        <br>&emsp;Regarding Abassid, you get gold for placing specialists, production based on Urban pop, and
                        science based on trade income. We are going to loose our routes, but getting them up while our initial
                        settlers travel off will do. I'd also put the +1 science on slotted resources --as we have for culture.
                        <br>&emsp;Wonder wise, Tomb of Askia in 2nd city is crucial. I feel pretty confident in our ability to
                        make
                        relics later in the age. We could invest in wonders with slots, as to avoid the amount of needed
                        temples,
                        but so aren't I worried. Distant Land settles, in one final sweep, will be converted --- which I
                        believe,
                        like foreign settlements, comes online truly upon the final theology tech. Treasure Fleet wise, I see
                        little
                        promise, as the reward is too small. I am going to keep principle, and choose a foreign empire that is
                        strong, rather than awkwardly angled for the sake of treasure fleats. Hopefully we may get 1 or 2 of the
                        points, but I'm not fretting over it. And science ought be easy.

                        I'd say very confidently that things are well. Swell even. But I will admitt that I am a bit off. In
                        less
                        acceptable ways, our yoga has been short, and thus our recovery from the stress and work prior has left
                        me
                        doing too little, and thus a little bare. I am not sure how to return to a more ample state; but I do
                        see,
                        that despite the obvious effect from not working out, 'that it was from the thinning trunk that such
                        abscence occured, and so ought we restablish that'.
                        <br>&emsp;Most of our yoga is there, in guidance, be on the floor, standing, quick or long. I do need
                        something that will bring us into downward dog and lunge, even boat or squat. But the road is clear
                        here,
                        'and we were simply too cluttered before, in order to partake in the jumble of vids'.
                        <br>&emsp;Eating wise were good, and will surely return to more wholesome foods upon our activity
                        increasing.

                        like
                        a long rope, so does it's natural give cause it to dip in the middle. There are many aspects to this,
                        namely
                        in our positive address of the world and the use of modelling, 'as to simply say, on such basis, be it

                        gather some accompanying ligments of measuremt devices and thermodynamics. And I see overall, how being
                        open
                        is really all I seek, and is in fact all I'm good to do. "For there is an irony in wishing for
                        something,
                        'even if it is of some grand plan born from your private ways', when such ways are in fact procurred and
                        developed by our flourishing means to readily and rightly do them: wherein the care and nerve for such
                        plan
                        is bare. That, and you naturally see far off, and by your grated stride, reach it. Which is to say, we

                        There is a positive response to everything. Doubts of this, suggest something neccessary, 'for how did
                        such
                        motions begin'. And indeed our inquiry lay.
                        <br>&emsp;But I'd like to describe things, or remark upon them as objects we normally see. Here lay
                        identity.
                        <br>&emsp;For I think of our heart and it's beating, our mind and it's way. And I think about the
                        reflections we have, or images, and how they sometimes frigthen us; and how this seems positive, in
                        that, of
                        your response, so is it to what appears to be there.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, as a sort of form to this principle, is that a brain, in all it's working
                        conduct, operates as seems natural; in that, if it creates images, that so would we remark upon them as
                        so.
                        But, as to render off the doubt of how we know, we merely say that so is our brain, or a complex amidst
                        that
                        which creates the sensation, is similarly real, and by that, also responding. "Our idea of self and its
                        orbiting ways, need not rely on some seperate motion; but incorporate it with the rest, as we do organs
                        and
                        tissues." For in that, our doubt is properly laid.

                        Looking at some of our concenrs, they tend to fall on the range of foods we eat. For I am abvoe
                        mentioning
                        our choice not to each ice cream or chocolate. But, as regards granola for instance, so is this not some
                        blatant averson. I decide no, but as such, 'rather than it being outside the question'.
                        <br>&emsp;Where the question lies, is in the grazing foods of bread, bags and or fried food. Dumplings
                        have
                        been nice, despite there time requirments. Bread has always been nice, but is not generally exciting.
                        Going
                        for naan has shown otherwise, but does cost a fair bit --with each piece being 2-3$. I'm unclear though
                        which of the three resterautns require a minimum amount; as I like to go, and getting 1 piece would be
                        enough. There is the whole-grain loaf at superstore, but this is not terribly special. "Something you
                        may
                        bring home from work, but not go back to get." Popcorn remains satisfying, as do potoates and
                        hashbrowns;
                        though these latter seem a little thin. A recent advent is yogurt. Similar to bringing home oat milk,
                        you
                        may go pack for 4 mini yogurts, or a solid tub. The latter is a bit expensvive, while the former are
                        less
                        than 4$ on sale. And they are fairly wholesome. Chips have never been an issue as we get the all-natural
                        ones. But there are an avocado made variety which is somewhat acceptable. A true moderate treat, 'that
                        djon
                        honey'. And I did see some good looking lentil, bean and rice pre-mades in the international section. "A
                        bit
                        more full and hearty than Old Ben." And besides this, are packs of spring rolls, be it the red ones, or
                        the
                        better value at Fresh Co; which also has banana chips. Similar to granola, I choose not to have corn
                        nuts,
                        though perhaps a fairer variety can be known. That, and seaweed is a great munchy, with little cost.
                        <br>&emsp;As regards training, I feel the need to do some, and let my body take it. I think our use of
                        yoga
                        ought recover us after work, and thus bring more training afterwrods. "This time, we did not reach that
                        point, and shed off much of our gains." Similar to free range, where it's about reaching a point of
                        exertion, training requires comparable bouts of squats, pushups and pullups, and some mix of running. I
                        think for our purposes, we ought let running be rinse, rather than a core part of the circuit.
                        <br>&emsp;Treat each exercise as seems fit. Squats are about patience, as you could relastically do a
                        100.
                        Drop, then pause, then drop again. Do this twice. For pushups, drop, pause, be it stabily in plank, on
                        the
                        ground, on your knees, in forward fold, or downward dog, then drop again, and do this twice --returning
                        to
                        standing in between. Chin Ups are hard, and perhaps we might simply train at home, then go scooter to
                        P.athletic to run. But I say this because our garage bar is solid for easier training. Using the
                        parallel
                        bars at Eagle park will do though. And I would say, that keep yourself going, but with fair rest. My
                        hesitance is in whether you can do more than one set, and if it's not better to just do multiple bouts
                        in
                        one contain sequence, pausing for longer in between. We'll see.

                        So our judgement get's thrown against the cliffs of our ego. As such is a cementing of what we know; and
                        thus, contrary views fit little.
                        <br>&emsp;The soruce of this cementing is fear, or desire. The source of these is generally your
                        parents,
                        common fears and the toil of labor.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is that the world is full of discourse. Generally, all are seperate in their
                        little groups, and thus speak in terms of such group. "Everyone is who is part of that group." I have no
                        problem with this. But, in our less than open state, we are perturbed by judgements which reflect the
                        fact
                        that there are other groups out there.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the great perrils of this, is in fairness or pretensionous, the words of other's run up
                        against our ego. This is so, for what they say may burden our clinging belief. And the response is so
                        critical, as we either deny, or ignore out of invalidation (of their part, as we deem). But there are
                        also
                        melancholic responses, whereby you don't assert or digress the viewpoint, but let it stand. Indeed, our
                        ego,
                        or sensibility, ought not be so rigged as to not accept other points, 'and let them come in and slide
                        out'.
                        We've experienced this, in ease and positivity. But despite our reproach to others, or allowance, so may
                        we
                        not be so light and ample, and by that, 'sure in our own righteous way: whereby were fine to hear and
                        accept'. Instead, our memory of this may serve us the proper response, but our state may be so as to not
                        be
                        but consumed by such point. Anger and resentment builds, as you feel your beliefs being torn at, and you
                        wish to affirm otherwise. But your past pleasure, or strenght, lets you sit with it, albeit in a sunken
                        state. "And indeed, the familiarity of this, or view of it, is such, that when this oppression is but
                        minor
                        and poking, you feel so unsure of whether it will ever go: as something so mild has no right to be
                        deemed
                        uncommon, while something terrible may be seen as a novel moment." I fear this melencholoy will not go,
                        'and
                        the root of that sulleness, is that when your core is so fine, and you affirm not, there is a ember of
                        truth
                        to the point given. As your flatter state, albeit willing to take in, holds no settled matter --for
                        which
                        our past time gives means to let in at all. But without it's own color and flair, as to happily take in
                        and
                        otherwise proceed, it seems like what's coming in as what there is at all'. Indeed, the cause of
                        affirmation
                        is clear then, in that, of what's coming in, we disagree. And so it feels all too painfull when such
                        impression is more or less consented to, 'as you fully take in, but have nothing that naturally witholds
                        it
                        from becoming the truth: as the bones of what you settled on prior, is flat'.

                        So I see that most concerns come down to judgement. As this proclaims some sort of meaning. And to be
                        clear,
                        saying something is good or bad, is a judgement that effects of a favorable or non favorable sort are
                        going
                        to happen. "Do this, it's good for you: you'll like the results."
                        <br>&emsp;I have noticed, at least I can clearly say, that of the subject in question, that I am not
                        always
                        on board to heed to such judgement. For, like Descrates, I don't think anyone judges better than
                        another,
                        but rather, what we use in our judgements, in terms of the matter of the subject. For, if someone says
                        that
                        their evaluating whether a meal is good or terrible, I'd say their consideration of whether it is so
                        horrible reflects deeper pretenses, of perhaps expectation, justificication. Or, better said, someone
                        may
                        simply say that the food is poor because of the way that a waiter spoke to them prior. Which is, in
                        point,
                        nothing to do with the food; but also not something which tries to convey the meaning of the food, and
                        thus
                        what is relevant to me. "Only the service is concerned with such matters." And even if we spoke of the
                        resteraunt as a whole, and someone was so heavily agasint it due to that experience with the waiter,
                        that so
                        might their judgement of all its parts be immoderate, 'do to the heavy weight of that one poor aspect'.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, be it on reddit, in conversation, or on tv, you can see the hilt in which people's
                        judgement rests.
                        <br>&emsp;The point is not so much about motive, as if they have some agenda. And, thus, we are not
                        struck
                        by any suspcion of there being so. Rather, when we suspect that the material which their judgements are
                        formed of, is dissproporiante, or at least absent when it comes to relevant things, then we see the
                        judgement as somewhat small and hollow. "Indeed, and I submitt this with full acceptance of our ego
                        being
                        tainted, and thus, with care to bring this to submission, but when it comes to the judgements which
                        overt
                        me, 'at least, those which spark my eye as being hollow', it is those which have this shiny appeal, be
                        it of
                        authority, rhetoric, tradition, even expertise, but that the mold of the judgement, in all its candor
                        and
                        hue, seems based in response to the fact that other people are also judging, and that by this one of our
                        own, so is it so, in importance, simply because others are also stated."
                        <br>&emsp;I think a solid case in point, is when the actual meaning of what people say, in that their
                        was
                        some true consequence, they bring up points like, 'our democracy, and the government', which ends up
                        being a
                        bold way of saying the least about the whole. And where my arrogance lies, is in the grafted confidence
                        that
                        our sensibility brings, but seems halted by some esteemed prediction that countries are going to war,
                        were
                        loosing our license and liberty, that crime will pluck our eyes out. The issue, is that these are all
                        objects dripping from some high ideology. Rather than remarking the reality of pipework, be it in the
                        fabric
                        of laws and jurisdiction, or literal water words and service, it remarks more about ideas. "And in many
                        ways, my attribution of vice to the predictions which come from this, come about because we think that
                        world
                        ought be better regarded." This holds our key though, for in that sense, when it is not in memory but a
                        current openness, then we are not so rot to defend it, and by that, tear down the words of others, who
                        speak
                        beyond such basis.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, our happiness is right, but not in our conduct. If it were, we would not have to pull
                        down
                        others, but rather exhibit our own words from such basis. "I know not though, what we should do when we
                        are
                        not so boutfull; and whether or not it is truly bad to hear others. Some admittance is fair, as in rest,
                        so
                        in idlenes can you enjoy and listen. But so, in the nature of your stillness, in its friction and gruff,
                        and
                        all the passion and affirmation to boot, ought you be cautious, as not to see, and from there respond,
                        to
                        others words. I know this is sound, for it speaks not even of their basis: as your own abscence makes
                        you
                        wish to hear nothing, poor as is likely, but even of that which is solid."

                        <br>&emsp;There is much which I'd enjoy, if not for our worked state. I am glad we did so, and likely
                        we'll
                        prep up from here. But things need to require less from me at the moment. God of War, Civ, New Girl,
                        Allies
                        even, sit here as great things ready to happen. I feel restless with writing and reading. And I don't
                        wish
                        to cower over think pieces or op eds. Porn will do, though I can't think of any wortwhile venture
                        tonight. A
                        scooter ride for sure, but the food we have is what we get. We'll go tomorrow. Looking for more yoga
                        vids
                        could be nice, and if we have the energy, a science victory is in our grasp, and the early parts of
                        Svartleheim. For Allies, there are alot of background vids, to accompany civ. But going into August,
                        with
                        Red Dead and the Direct, I'd be cautious. And as regards our time moving forward, Star Wars sits when
                        and if
                        you want it; as is Star Trek resting for our scrumptious time.

                        I'll say, for the sake of definition, that all things amount to, innately, what they are, but through
                        that,
                        amount to nothing more than a form, a property, be it in numbers or width, and as such, exhibit
                        themselves
                        with such properties, as the thing they distinctly are. "As a group and person are both things,
                        differing
                        merely in properties."
                        <br>&emsp;There is nothing in the world which does not fall down this line. Seeing as the world is full
                        of
                        things, it is clear, that all things weave amongst eachother; but almost neccesarily miss many. A knot
                        here
                        may cause tension on a string far out, but so is this an indirect effect, and the actual relation in
                        that
                        string far out, is of the cause it recieves; which, however sprung, is not by those who pushed, but of
                        the
                        end of their action which they recieved. And ought our judgement, in being concerned with action, care
                        only
                        about that: less we are going to do something about those who we'd explain as initiating such cause.
                        Just as
                        one's parents are not the cause of their offrsprings crimes, so is a crime in Florida not to be blamed
                        for
                        the effect it has on the economy in that state, and how such state interacts with your own. How your
                        state
                        receives effects from Florida can be explained by one of it's crimes, but it is the effect which said
                        crime
                        procurres in Florida, and then exhibits itself in the relation between Florida and our state, that we
                        can
                        properly say, as regards us, is the cause. "For even if one is stressed about what someone said, and in
                        their lapse of attention hit someone with their car, so the story goes, but their place as the driver is
                        judged no less."

                        Something we ought admitt, besides our ability to deal with something bad, and by natural extension of
                        that,
                        other's ability, is that something bad may in fact happen.
                        <br>&emsp;And like many things, the judgement we offer is only sound, when the scenario at hand is
                        properly
                        stated; but also the value's in question.
                        <br>&emsp;For the ultimate plea of someone in trouble is so, that of the force invovled, ought we defeat
                        it.
                        But of their actual experience, ought we not forget who they are as one subject to such force. By this,
                        ought we remark fairly upon our fears, and whether they are of ourselves, or in sympathy; and if the
                        latter,
                        to which extent? "For we don't simply mean all those who are far off; as many are more ore less fine as
                        we,
                        in their own comparable locale."
                        <br>&emsp;And so it is far beneath the abilities of man to esteem and or proclaim a shadowed view of
                        something, 'whereby nothing but a point is addressed, while all else is caked in shadow'. And it is
                        another,
                        that, within reason, that our place and other's is not also pointedly met, but as broad and complex as
                        the
                        situation at hand. "There is indeed a moment where the blade enters one's heart, but ought our sympathy
                        not
                        extend to the trepidation prior, and labor in reaching that." And as one's whose fears are more than
                        likely
                        in sympathy, ought we not be so clouded, or drug rather, in such discomfort, 'pointedly'.

                        So we finished Aksum, 'winning with flying colors'.
                        <br>&emsp;It is time now that we up the anti, and face the gods.
                        <br>&emsp;Doing so though, beyond the managerial competition, is the matter of combat. As said Gods are
                        much
                        harder than even the heartiest of our earthen lot. And by that, beyond our reach for yields, ought we
                        also
                        prepare ourselves to defend. Offense is possible, but nearly demands a tailored course. While even the
                        faintest of attemps can be taken, if you respect the potential risk and cause of conflict.
                        <br>&emsp;At the root of it, +1 support from the first militaristic tree. It has been noted to me that
                        you
                        can change mementos each age, and so, regarding expansionist, which has the least access, so can you
                        choose
                        this freely for the first age, and then select not for exploration. Military legacies are generally the
                        hardest to achieve, 'though two can be found'. And you do get a wildcard each age. Plus, hanging gardens
                        offers an expansionist, and I generally wish to reach the third tier, 'if my aim is specialists'.
                        <br>&emsp;One important element, is commanders, and their mix of defensive and offensive abilities.
                        Usually,
                        it is quite accesible for you to get 1 merrit badge. There may also be merrit in having 2 commanders, as
                        this can add more width to your defense, and variation, 'be it for healing or further offense'.
                        Otherwise,
                        in the tech masteries there lies combat increases for all classes of units. And it would not be foolish
                        to
                        consider the route of an invasion, and to add some defenses with that in mind; and thus, also invest in
                        boosts to such fortifications.
                        <br>&emsp;Gate of All Nations is a clear and direct boost to your combat, 'adding 2 support in all
                        wars'.
                        "This essentially halves the brevity of the gods". It is somewhat competative, but is not in need of a
                        mad
                        rush. Hanging Gardens is similar, and they tend to be available around the same time.
                        <br>&emsp;Besides Dur Sharoken and Red Gate, there appears to be no other wonders which assist in war.
                        Nor
                        does the military tree offer much more than the +1 support. Civ bonuses are the distinct factor, along
                        with
                        tile placement and commander effects. One benefit beyond antiquity is the naval commander, as they can
                        quickly accumulate merrit badges, 'as the trees are shorter'. It would not be ill-advised to form an
                        early
                        navy and assault independants around the world's coasts. Similarly, once Modern hits, set up aerodromes
                        in
                        all corners of your empire, as to cover various points of attack. Water combat is generally costly, and
                        thus
                        requires flanking and commander support. But airplanes can attack unscathed, and thus soften targets
                        prior
                        to your own ships attacking.

                        If I could, I'd like to be forthcoming. First is porn. I've noticed myself a little overt, or
                        susceptible
                        rather, to the pleas and thoughts of others; and I can't help but think our muddle relationshiup with
                        porn
                        is a contributing factor. I held this view for some time, and it's not till of late that I've been less
                        reserved in using it. Mostly, because I find it rewarding. But not so much in the wholeness of it's
                        good,
                        but as a sort of activity or distraction, 'akin to going to get food'. I don't feel our suspicion is far
                        off; but I therein seek a better means of masterbating; as such an affair I find a fair delight. For
                        one,
                        our means to arouse ourself, albeit easier by the prescence of people, is one that can be alleviated by
                        accessories: namely our hanlder. The smell of it is no clear issue, but rather the hiding of it, as to
                        be
                        private. Right now it is hidden, and has been since I got it. But, due to our proximity to other's, we
                        are
                        more inclined to use it when no one is home, 'as it is hard to wash otherwise, without getting cum on
                        the
                        bath floor'. We may deal with that in it's own right, or use it indiscretely when no one is home; as we
                        can
                        more reasonably wash it afterwards. But the main thing is, to have it hidden, nor exposed, but able to
                        be
                        accessed, in the rings, the lube and the handle. We can make this happen when none are at home, and
                        hopefully permitt our use of it, as to suffice the poorer side of our want.
                        <br>&emsp;As for leisure, we are finishing New Girl, really just watching it and skipping through. I am
                        somewhat overt to Civ commentaries, 'as they fall in line with most'. Guides and or calm playthroughs
                        are
                        welcome, 'but this is more in line with Pacther and Bardown', rather than allies.
                        <br>&emsp;God Of War is great, and I'm really getting into Ragnorak. Civ is wonderful, and I will soon
                        mention our plans for the game next.
                        <br>&emsp;Food wise, I've shied away from Naan, as I see it less fitting for our work to come. When that
                        is
                        over we'll be free. We've worked out, and unlike recent memory, our neck is not sore. I am sensing a bit
                        of
                        exhaustion, in terms of choice, but having yoga to do, for guidance' sake, has caused this finer result,
                        and
                        treated me well in general. I can see how it comes though while were active, and how it leaves when that
                        is
                        gone. I even see how, upon work, without a grundge forward to train, we may not do yoga either. And I
                        think
                        the truth, is that your bodies roots need cleansing first, in groundwork namely. Standing is fine, as
                        are
                        lunges and downward dog. But being clear, as we were not last week, is the core good: and we've done
                        quite
                        well in organizing an allotment of sweet and healthy selections.
                        <br>&emsp;I can't quite think of anything regarding good, if only to keep away from carb thinners; as I
                        feel
                        with hashbrowns and bread right now. I feel more keen on sugar, but mixed of something whole, like
                        yogurt. I
                        can't think of anything else though.

                        otherwise
                        remove, and the Elephant, which is surely a Barbarian killer of Godly defense.

                        soul
                        improvement and thus one which you can readily invest in.
                        <br>&emsp;There seems to be little strenght besides this. Indeed, this is a general Civ like Egypt. One
                        odd
                        boon is more codex slots, which may allow easier science legacy acquisition.

                        <br>&emsp;to go to Inca, 'to be of the mountain'. I think with principles we can succeed, and at least

                        about such principles as we struggle. For modern, I'll try for tycoon.
                        <br>&emsp;The Inca have a stronger archer, who does more from rough tiles, and a better scout, who can
                        see
                        through mountains. "This can hopefully protect our borders from the deity AI."
                        <br>&emsp;The terrace farm is their main advent, giving +6 food outright.This may also be boosted if the
                        settlement has a granary, plus even more from its innate adj. to mountains; but this extends to farms
                        too.
                        It must be built on a rought terrain tile adj. to a moutnain, town placement and district positioning
                        are
                        important earlier on. Also, Pachacutti gives food for buildings adj. to mountains, but this may conflict
                        with possible terrace farm locations. I am willing to change start bias for other leaders, so we have
                        mountains. Ben Franklin seems strong, as he can make up for early production and science shortcomings
                        (comapred to the gods).
                        <br>&emsp;Key things to look out for is a food boost to city centers adj. to mountains, or with 3 worked
                        mountain tiles. You may also get +1 happiness to moutnain tiles, giving them a 2 food, 1 prod. and 1
                        happiness total.
                        <br>&emsp;Borobodur gives +2 food and happiness to all quarters.
                        <br>&emsp;I think, for this game, we may benefit from obtaining the civ specific wonders, namely Angkor
                        Watt
                        and Machu Pichu. I believe much of each Civ's balance coincides with their ability to get such strenght.
                        Machu in particular, gives +8 culture to each quarter surrounding it.
                        <br>&emsp;You may get free movmenent over rough terrain, food from incoming trade routes, a poison
                        ability
                        from your archer, and production from rural population, and gold from urban. This last part cements the
                        growth orientation for the build.
                        <br>&emsp;For economics, you need trade routes and resource slots. Treasure fleets are tough as you may
                        not
                        have the means or land to acquire them. You may ignore this, but require more gold and influence to
                        achieve
                        modern victroy. In that case, you must acquire factory resources, get to industrialization, which is the
                        third colum of the bottom tech tree, then slot in a kind of resource into such city --cocoa for
                        instance,
                        but as many copies of it as you can fit. This gives increased points, up to 300 I believe. Then for a
                        grand
                        sum, plus some destination travel, victory.

                        I have no genuine interest to end wars or sickness. Indeed, by our common sense, we may see, as perhaps
                        propelled in our lingering state, a calmer view of the world that we wish to share; but generally, I am
                        in
                        such world and not looking to express this. But we may still: but it is merely of the problems which are
                        not. "The root of which, in our contention of those who claim otherwise, lie in family and experts."
                        <br>&emsp;As remarks expectation, you may say, that good or bad things will happen, and that we may be
                        gracious of this, or otherwise formidable; or we may be dispondent, or broken down. And so may we see
                        this
                        in other people.
                        <br>&emsp;There is just too little constancy in our life. We've been coming hither and fro, to the
                        effect
                        that our friends and relations are absent. As such, our baser life, in it's less than pointed harmony to
                        such things, has no easy means to develop such. "In many ways, the bluntness of said point, made it so
                        even
                        a relatively long period of time was not enough for something to manifest: and thus upon the changing
                        winds,
                        we went."
                        <br>&emsp;I say, merrily, and in the root of joy, that seeing the world near and more or less far around
                        you, brings me a calm delight and satiety. The sun rising, burning the later evening sky, this is simply
                        enough. "Doth the King be further appreciated too, for his many more bounties."
                        <br>&emsp;I lie though, with a sort of distastesfull passion, namely in the aversion to bad things
                        happening, or any novel goods which occuring at all. We apply ourselves little, nor admitt faint or
                        solid
                        points. "Were a bit to crept inward, 'as if our pains and struggles are dug in to joyous path: for we so

                        we are either in a state of roughness, or calm eruption."

                        unchained,
                        'but from what grounds are we enlightened from, and still carying the weight of'.
                        <br>&emsp;What seems most true, is that judgement was never, as it appeared, at our door. The folk
                        around us
                        were not interested in me, 'and only by our lack of harmony with them, did we spurr disdain'. Our
                        dissociation was led by me, and our less than amiable ways. Not that we were abbrasive, but that we did
                        not
                        partake in the wits and ways of other people. This was so, primarily, by our response to the requirments
                        around me. And, in our resolve to those, we felt little interest or validity in the ways of others.
                        <br>&emsp;It would have been nice if we could have seen the good around us; and do more of what we were
                        supposed to do, and by that, been more upright to mingle with others. But, in the principled duty, we
                        were
                        nothing but average, 'or sufficient, as to feel free from worry and shame'. It was as if someone had a
                        chain
                        around me, and instead of handle it mightily, and by those encumbent strides, walk amidst others, we
                        instead
                        cowered, 'and did only what would be pleasing and enough for the rope around us'.
                        <br>&emsp;In our early years, we were acclimitized to friends by natural circumstance; in that, by
                        familiarty, many orbited around. But, prior to our secondary years we moved, and from that point we
                        could
                        not look past or mingle, 'even if we were happy'. I don't recall being in turbelence at the time, and
                        was
                        more or less undrawn to the whims of others. "It was all gallantry and fluff." Indeed, our place in that
                        did
                        not need to be so, as if there was one soul place. But, at the time leading into highschool, our world
                        felt
                        very singular and defined. The peak of it held those properties, and so settled at the bottom, 'having
                        fun
                        with nerdy, unpopular kids'.
                        <br>&emsp;As we entered highschool, this disdain for fluff and esteem lingered with me. And despite
                        having a
                        few close friends, I never felt inclined to be apart of anything more. I don't feel too unique in this,
                        'but
                        of others around me, they felt like co-workers, who I'd see in spot, then leave to go home'. "They were
                        meantime people."
                        <br>&emsp;As it happened, time went on, and by natural familiarity, we became more acquainted. We had a
                        friend group, got a girlfriend, and things were alright. I acted to sharply though, 'as I would with
                        closer
                        friends, or family even'. This friend group of mine, 'who oddly enough, were not like those former, for
                        if
                        they were our bluntness would not mean so much'; but as it were, they were averse to me, and sent me
                        away.
                        "To my otherwise best friend too."
                        <br>&emsp;The basic view of this, is that success breads satisfaction, 'as you feel in line with the
                        neccessary path'. But if you find yourself overt to the things which give warmth around such amends,
                        then
                        you may not be so keen or excited to oblige. And as it happened, the judgement around me regarding
                        success,
                        was more or less explicit. Not in magnitude but seriousness, 'as none, despite the world never falling,
                        never felt or exclaimed passivity when it came to the elements of success'.
                        <br>&emsp;Our lack of place, in terms of friends and confidence, brought with it a sort of groove, of
                        which,
                        in terms of comfort, was only filled with dear times and close friends. This did not procure a far view
                        of
                        the world though. A view which those surrounding judgements seemed to aim at. "Thus our youth felt
                        aligned
                        to such ends, but with the complexion of a chore, rather than meaningfull task."
                        <br>&emsp;And I felt this deeply through my teenage years, this sort of sense that, despite our talents
                        and
                        character, 'that we were in fact pathectic, or at least a little average and lame'. Despite our grasp
                        for
                        peace amidst judgement, 'whereby our wish was not so in line with the ends of such judgement, rather
                        their
                        present satiety', so were we also defensive, and by that cynical, 'as if we saw others success, or felt
                        embarrased and ashamed, and thus exclaimed ourself (in angst and pride), to the futility of those around
                        me.'
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, by that natural familiarity, we entered a group of friends, and relationship, by
                        the
                        mere coelescence of our circumstance, rather than, had it been earlier, an actual embellishment of what
                        would procure such, and effectively. While our more or less inhereted state was one who's strucutre was
                        as
                        strong as our mozzying whims. "Which, encased with cynciism and defense, hoisted our social demise."
                        <br>&emsp;As the story goes, our consolation to such ways, was such, that of our friends and happiness,
                        we
                        amended to the fullest degree. But without solid candor or taste, we ignored, and in some sense
                        beligered,
                        those otherwise 'dutiful' judgements. "For which the road to philosophy lay."

                        see those who are one of the lot, ordinate to custom and the whole. There are those who make the

                        judgements. You befriend ignornance, 'being so comfortable with her, that you fear not her by your side:

                        a fuller sense, to describe the open, flowing, sweet complexion.

                        you
                        are not overwhelmed by them. "At least, upon being pushed over, you get back up; or return at least to a
                        steady standing." Another way of looking at this, is that by reason, we can accept things as fair, or at
                        least natural, and thus just to expect. "For many of our concerns come from indignation, and thus
                        complaimt."
                        <br>&emsp;Surrounding this is the matter of wisdom, which beyond one's response in things, tailors our
                        choices as to be driven towards the best of things, 'and not those which bring more concern, or
                        dullness'.
                        <br>&emsp;In this, we say, that fortune is either made or risen to, 'in that, we make solid choices, or
                        handle what's dealt to us'.
                        <br>&emsp;In this abscence of worry and fear, along with indecence, we relish the world around. For when
                        our
                        eye's aren't unerved, we see the leaves, bristling in the wind. Or when our ears are not so ladden with
                        drama and doubt, the birds song can be heard through the morn. And when our time is not spent on dull
                        affairs, or restless exertion, we may delight in the coming end, in which the sun sets, 'and all but the
                        deepest blues linger in the sky'.
                        <br>&emsp;There is so much to this. And, as one who finds good in writing or painting, 'so may we learn
                        the
                        grammar of the stars,' and by that, attune our mind to see her, hear her, 'and take her hand'.
                        <br>&emsp;This craft is the front end of liberty. As upon her liberated behind, lies the form in which
                        her
                        blossom's grow. "The route in which our heart sings: which, in said craft, marks how we practice."
                        <br>&emsp;The grand insight though, is that as a child, we live in relatively liberal ways. We go
                        outside,
                        run around, enjoy things for the pure sake of fun. But in being raised, the deedes of the world are
                        revealled to us. And generally, it is not the surpassing of these that we are reared to me, 'in that
                        we'd be
                        withtou concern', but that we should be eligble and sufficient in meeting them at all. As it were, upon
                        one's oblige, so do they learn that craft. For a child, in their liberal grandeur, is more like a
                        weightless
                        whim, 'going here and there as they wish, but with little style or form to bolden their claim'. As we
                        mature
                        and become able, so do we angle the form of our joy, 'as not to be so airy and basic, but rather full of
                        matter and love'. Indeed, as one learns to speak and run, so do these natural faculties draw more light
                        in;
                        whereby, near and upon ouur younger condition, so is our delight more mature, 'in that our childish
                        whims,
                        weighed upon by common deed, rear their head to a more definite end'. Indeed, such an end, 'as seen by
                        one
                        aged and stated,' is the mard of a meaningfull life: as such a sight is born from one truly living:
                        while a
                        child is one whose life is being made for them.
                        <br>&emsp;I find then, that as our contentment with the deeds given become uneven, that our wishes and
                        care
                        for the world become extended. "Whereby we fear for those in war, of far off lands and places; or we
                        more
                        merrily seek the breads of Paris, or wilds of Bengal". This is no solid remark, 'and is better deemed a
                        stain, upon our lapse of reason and or might'.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, I see that our own ease within obligate matters, is less defined or just in regards
                        to
                        children, 'but beyond our passion, not much else'. I may, rightly or in lust, seek to contribute, or be
                        seen, but besides that, 'so is our solidity claimed'. For I can, with the git of moutnains and bookish
                        delight, support myself in such, through means which I am more or less pleased, and reliable stated to.
                        In
                        terms of taxes and correspondence, I am all but nearly there. "Lacking only the words my dream's
                        require." I
                        am a manager, the breadmaker, the comfort, a stand, all in myself, 'in solitude or company'.
                        <br>&emsp;I am not always seen as someone who is such, and that be it of happiness, natural ends,
                        impassioned deeds or glorious heights,that so are we unbecoming, and by that, in need of pressure and
                        suggestion to do so. Whether we are near said voices or far away, it is our own solidity that keeps me
                        about, 'and with pleasure listens, openly, nor with any fear of dismissal, nor integral doubt'.

                        it will remove any concerns.
                        <br>&emsp;I'd like to do some sort of word exercises before we go; which will be shoes on 840.
                        <br>&emsp;We can walk in the near door, place our scooter and jacket, and bag too. I will need to eat,
                        and
                        likely at our first break. Let it be early if need be, and deal with your physicality for lunch. Maybe
                        we'll
                        take two 15s then lunch. Just make sure you eat. Pack a banana and t.mix, and we'll eat during break or
                        lunch.
                        <br>&emsp;As for in and outs, let's be cordial and prepared, so it's easier to rightly leave. If chance
                        has
                        it, we'll go out the side door. Otherwise, its 2 minutes to leave, a few mintues home, and few mintues
                        back,
                        and nearly right in and ready to go. "Leaving our bag with scooter is a permissable choice." That gives
                        20
                        minutes at home.
                        <br>&emsp;Our jeans, shirt and sweater are clean, though I could use some laundry now. Less it's
                        freezing,
                        I'll just wear my raincoat. Because I sleep in our grey one, I need to get a secondary one. Maybe we'll
                        start sleeping in the checkered one, and leave our grey one for walks and outings.

                        and
                        whoever else.
                        <br>&emsp;I am frightened, as our judgement of things is absent. Fairly, in reproach, or with the
                        mingling
                        of lazyness.
                        <br>&emsp;Other people's judgement errode me then, 'as I have nothing to contend with'. In response, I
                        accept that they are simpling speaking as so, and better communicate myself. In a way, all the reasons
                        which
                        I'd use to reject and or invalidate their argument, is a way in which our own is lacking: and thus, of
                        our
                        own speaking, we are reproached. For there is so much I don't know, nor do I wish to judge based on an
                        incomplete picture. "Judging someone by their cover, is poor, because you do not know what's inside. The
                        point being, that you don't know something entirely, and judging from so." It is not often that this is
                        recognized, 'and one's gut is given esteem', rather the sense that there is more to something is not
                        known.
                        From that, I have given many things a deep and honest reflection. There are many communities in the
                        world,
                        and not much in terms of wordly action is done but by a select piece of them. But, indirectly does this
                        inform me, 'as if the breadth of the world I know validates our abscence from current thought, as there
                        is
                        only more clearly a great deal I don't know'. Yet, this does not explain or fortell what will happen. It
                        may
                        suggest how things mean, 'as not even I believe, rightly, that the world will erupt'. But there may be
                        conflict, and of a violent sort. This is sad, and once settled peacefully under the notion that such
                        thing
                        wouldn't happen at all. But just as there are combatants in the world else, so may it cross our door. My
                        judgement is not such that me or my family are at risk, nor my community even. But of those who are, so
                        doth
                        the root of our contempt lay, 'for those instigating such belidgerence'.
                        <br>&emsp;I have simply not given these matters any serious thought. I know to little, and am more broad
                        in
                        my source of meaning, and thus not spurred to contempt. Indeed, the feeling I get, is that people see
                        the
                        bad in entirety, 'as if their view of things is evily saturated', and thus their contempt lay. And,
                        beyond
                        our expectation of anything happening at all, 'where the bad is nearer than I'd imagine', and our
                        otherwise
                        steadfastness in the vastness in which strands of misfortune lay, that so are we, in our blankedness,
                        comparably saturated by other's own inflammed views. "There deep colors quickly saturate me."
                        <br>&emsp;And indeed, all that has occured, is that in our fairness, our life, our place in the times,
                        that
                        we are not well of, or safe in ignorance. At least, of that which we are in fact afraid of, in the
                        meagerest
                        of work, or in desire of, 'for things far off and way', that so are we acordingly unrooted and set, and
                        by
                        that, 'subject to the whims of our baser impurity; which, as they say, reflects the pangs of maturity,
                        whereby you see the world in whole and finely, yet upon your lapse, so doth irriation lay'.

                        Liberty is the encumabcne of a condition, and doing so well enough, that your unburdened by it. Not that
                        you
                        are relieved, but without the weight of it: despite it still being there.
                        <br>&emsp;From this, I see the coarse of all our lives.
                        <br>&emsp;For a government may see reason to fight, and by that encourage and or demand that citizens
                        comply. This is a condition thus laid upon you, or one which you may be emtionally drawn to or simply
                        interested in.
                        <br>&emsp;But the point, is that you don't try and remove problems, rather treat them well so that they
                        weigh on you not. Some things are indeed misfortunes, while other's are just. As I am right to work
                        despite
                        being at home, nor am I misfortuned to one day die. "I can't even think of a misfortune I have, merely
                        things that are fairly asked of me."
                        <br>&emsp;The goods of reason then, are those which come from this oblige to circumstance, as not to
                        overt
                        it, or remedy it's ware upon you; but to instead fitfully amend, 'and feel the weight no longer'. To
                        rise to
                        it's task, and become light and mighty in your handle on it.
                        <br>&emsp;In regards to my life, so are we coming up to work, then home. Masturbation is helpful, as
                        there
                        are pretty girls who I may be unerved around. But I don't care for porn, as it exasterbates my
                        interests,
                        and makes me more nervous. Father is leaving next week, and we'd be wise to lube up. We still have some,
                        and
                        we ought set up our bin, as to get the things we need.
                        <br>&emsp;Laundry wise, we have jackets, sheets, blanets and clothes. In terms of showering, ought we do
                        it.

                        I feel fair in thinking that certain things are not right to start now. Our yoga for instance, or online
                        dating; these have been notions in my mind for some time; but upon our work, that seems the priority,
                        and
                        setting those other things up feels like an addition upon our flow into work.
                        <br>&emsp;In the weeks prior, each point has been a hurdle. One which we've crossed, but with little but
                        relief sought after. Now, were in motion, going to and fro work. And I won't elaborate, but the very
                        fact
                        that we are employed, and in a spread out fashion, along with being near people and as such regulated,
                        makes
                        our stay at home right. "And is merely a proper form in our current being."
                        <br>&emsp;But as were going through this motion, certain things are around. And I think of Jess, who
                        seems
                        to work so much then come home, but does nothing else --short of seeing her friends. I feel similar, in
                        that
                        there are all these things floating infront of me, but my care to grab them is low. Time must go on, and
                        through general acquiescence, so can we find the moments to address these things, and make them more
                        near
                        and present. Our recovery for instance, in yoga, has come plentfiuly along. But our stability still
                        leaves
                        alot to be desired. We need not do it to repair though, as we are already fine. The mark of it is of a
                        mere
                        recognition, 'as if the scent of it had caught our attention'. Naturally, and for the better, we'll
                        address
                        those things then. I see this in terms of our bookmarking, finding more books, reading and tailoring our
                        own. The study of light, clouds and graphics fairs similar. As do our yoga guides and or self made
                        videos.
                        <br>&emsp;All we ought do is go through some range of motion, and likely prior to a easy rest leading
                        into
                        the work day. Our investment in fit 4 less seems valid, 'as recovering makes the joy of work more
                        accessible, nor our liberties weighed upon'.
                        <br>&emsp;I'd say, that despite us being cozy and at home, and justfully through our employment, that we
                        may
                        spend our time tightening our other threads; namely, in how we clean and bathe, communicate our
                        judgements
                        and or withdrawals from others. These are part of who we are, at home, with friends, or at work. You may
                        not
                        notice these, as you do the labor of PCX, 'but so these flames come ultimately'. And may we serve our
                        memory
                        of this happening, with the candor of what would simply quench trouble.

                        The form of our way, is such, that by some course, we sought peace over elation. But as this manifested,
                        our
                        aim became one in which the abscence of problems was sought, rather than overcumbing them. "The effect
                        being
                        one, in which we are without any opposition, but thus a little bare and in our lack of a response."
                        <br>&emsp;And so in our reflections, we stood on the grounds which so freely gazed at the stars; but by
                        that, recognized the need for acquisition, to provide for this. For so long, this hill of freedom was
                        sought, 'with hopes that all requirments were gone'. Yet some unhdoutbedly stayed.
                        <br>&emsp;I think of our childhood, and our approach into youth and all it's contention. In such times,
                        be
                        it young or old, we had deeds to meet, and obligations at that. Some felt unneccessary, other's fair.
                        But so
                        did the increasing pleas for things beyond our post, leave me unnerved with such present, but not either
                        drawn or convinced of such beyond.
                        <br>&emsp;Our story is so, that of our cares, so were they concentrated on the sprouts of our present,
                        'and
                        our dedication to all that cultaivted that'. We steared away from the fears and desires ahead, and
                        sought
                        all the good that came from being rightly present.
                        <br>&emsp;The truth though, is that less there was a total abscence of demand, then the meager amount
                        you
                        had saw us buckle under our 'liberal press'. Which is to say, that we lacked any good that came with the
                        benefits and or commradery of future regards. And in our present stake, so were blossomed, but without
                        much
                        of a frame against actual demands. Indeed, we obliged to such deeds, 'but also fortified our liberty, or
                        present being'.
                        <br>&emsp;There is this element of craft, or defintiion rather, in which, the whole and shining world
                        seen
                        from our point of liberty, needs a sort of hilt, or at least foundation to stand on. And this was so,
                        for
                        based on the good we had, and the common deeds to get it, the meager amount of this could not suffice
                        for
                        the loose joys of our liberty. In pure abscence, 'as one experiences on a weekend, or over the summer',
                        such
                        joys are fufulling. But once outward regards come to be, such enjoyments deflate. And so giving some
                        form
                        and craft to such things, prevents the common deeds of the world from weighing you down.
                        <br>&emsp;My adolescence was very much about raising the height of our joy, and finding worth in doing
                        so.
                        "Even at the cost of everything else." My road to adulthood though, was in the accepetance of our place
                        in
                        life, as a person, a man, a son, brother, friend. And as such, we could not live as though our liberty
                        would
                        be uncontended, 'or withouth the whiffs of demand'. Indeed, at the beginning of this stage, I found much
                        console in this, as I saw the joy that could occur around our deeds as sufficient. "Yet our deeds felt
                        like
                        things to run from; be it by our own ware, or the feeling of shame by others." It never could be enough,
                        even though I felt it so.
                        <br>&emsp;Moving forward, we tried to deal with such matters; but to an end which ultiamtely accepted
                        them
                        as being so. "And nothing but for our dreams to wonder about, in ceasing." As such, we did find our
                        place in
                        a motion which was right and relatively stable; and one which we were more free to accept. As such, we
                        held
                        those initial sentiments of form and definition, 'as to give the joy surrounding our condition a means
                        for
                        volume and constance'. But via cirucmstance, we were granted entry into a weightless scenario, and left
                        to
                        our whims and ways.
                        <br>&emsp;The oddity in life though, is that even without employment, you still have the wares of your
                        health and natural state. From this, I always felt that it was a remark of other's scorn, that I could
                        not
                        relieve myself as I would under a clear condition, but in this liberal case. While I was up north
                        though, I
                        did not accept or begrieve such a notion. As despite feeling the wish for it, I ultimately accepted that
                        the
                        happiness we cared for would not come about through such permission. "That even without judgement, we
                        still
                        ough behave ourselves." But the reality, was that we were admirably flourishing in a place that needed
                        me
                        not to. Indeed, had we been more occupied, than our firmer want of comfort and relief would be more
                        fitting
                        with the demands of our scenario. But we ultimately choose to retain our lack of condition, and live as
                        the
                        happiness required of that needed. For we were not pleased to be absent of worry and time, but otherwise
                        soft and idle. Nor, at the time, did we wish for invovlement or promising activity. I simply choose to
                        live
                        as the form of a non-conditioned happiness stated.
                        <br>&emsp;Practically, this was never as easy to commiserate. As you could only do so much; nor was our
                        environment free from pokes and prods. "And indeed, our adolescent dreams came in the form of that which
                        would heighten such freedoms: to make them preferably so."

                        At some point I will confer about our duties, and the meager means to meet them. I may consider the
                        rules
                        and custom which erect them, or pose them as a demand, or simply worthwhile, but more or less, I am in
                        tune
                        with such things, and need more remarks about our amends, and how we'll effectively demonstrate those.
                        <br>&emsp;But, seeing as that moment is not here, and we are thus below the weight of lacking such, I
                        will
                        remark on those sights which my 'flatter state' is holding onto. "For, like passion, my delights, upon
                        my
                        means to be with them, slip into the realm of definition: where I try and hold principled attention,
                        since
                        our actual prescence to them is seperate: I try and hold myself there, for they are so dear, 'and I hate
                        to
                        seem them go', and with all might, bear our credulous regard, 'for in moments where the abyss is
                        calling, I
                        fight to prevent them becoming such memory'."
                        <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this is our physical study. The issue of light has pressed me for some time,
                        as
                        remarking on our senses and impression, and by that, our view of the composite world, falls short of
                        what it
                        could be, in confidence and like, when our means to illustrate light, heat, their motions, and otherwise
                        form, is either absent, 'or but a basic term, rather than vibrant concept'. "One ought know the fish and
                        places of a reef, rather than it merely being one: for you can only then say so little."
                        <br>&emsp;Adjacent to this is emperical methodology, namely, in spectroscpoy, carbon dating and other
                        modes
                        in which particles are observed. This is valued on our natural basis, 'as we can better claim the soul
                        of
                        the world, if, by such measurments, we can thus, in it's constitution, claim'. But similar to
                        composition,
                        in that you ought know more than a basic term, so ought you know more than the prescence of something,
                        'that
                        your knowledge amounts to knowing that something is there'. This awareness is but the crust of learning,
                        as
                        you ought know how such things are known to be there. For it is one thing to say the earth is however
                        old,
                        and another as to why, and thus how: by that, we may actually understand what the earth being so old
                        means,
                        as the mark that tells us so --as seen through instruments-- tells us also about the object at hand.
                        <br>&emsp;Lastly, on the finer things, is the mark of a cloud, or mountain. This is so, that we look at
                        Golden Ears, and see it in whole; but we also see that one of its peaks is called Blandshand, the other
                        the
                        Needle. But I do not know what they are, 'as if, Golden Ears the thing or place, had some feature, like
                        snow
                        even'; yet I could not say what such feature was, 'like a scratch or tatoo on someone's arm'. How ought
                        I
                        even state the heart of the mountain. Clouds are no different, in their flat expanse or roaring tuffs.
                        There's even varied kinds of puff, be it the rising flat heads, or bundled rolls. These need better
                        names,
                        'for I wish to say more than it is nice and cloudy out'. As all days are different, and the suns rays
                        even
                        cast differently on the land around. I'd like to even see that, in the varied hues, but particularly, of
                        what is shined on.
                        <br>&emsp;I'll talk a bit of leisure too, as I find, in our applied work, or that of duty, that we
                        always
                        come back to games and watching. And, albeit fine and plenty, there are moments where the old stuff
                        feesl a
                        bit to so; or, in a slower state, we have less interest, 'and need something new, or at least something
                        to
                        bide our time'. Game wise, Fallout and Red Dead come to mind. We've just finished God of War and are
                        working
                        through Ragnorak, and there is Avowed and Indiana Jones, but, freely, and with more breadth, there is
                        Fallout, and its starting adventure, full of scavenging and fun, and Red Dead, that, despite requiring
                        mods,
                        is full of wilderness exploration, hunting, bounties, quests, and colorfull scenery. Civ remains fun,
                        and in
                        understanding the parts of the ages, your civ and strategy, there remains much fun. Trying new things
                        comes
                        when you are in the groove of the game, 'as you see the mould, but through cirucmstance orient that'.
                        The
                        natural wonder battle seems a perfect fit for Spain, and I am full of delight at our coming Maurya game;
                        and
                        even a combat one, with Rome, or Persia.
                        <br>&emsp;Show wise, I am right in the heart of fall allies. We are going through the latter part of our
                        Inca game, and there is much to overhear while doing so. And I just can't help but feel nice, in terms
                        of
                        gaming to, that our pace of life is both right and forward, 'and thus, of what we see afar, so are we
                        free
                        and happy to meet, and thus anticipate: which gives much rest now'.

                        To continue this line of thought, I see, that we are in fear of other's judgement; and when we see them

                        actual possessed by what we figured, then we may feel defensve of what other's have presumably found.
                        "As
                        our sights are elsewhere, yet, we have no confidence or indifference from getting there."
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I see, that akin to our physical sights, and geopgrhical too, that the history of our
                        world is even more lost. For we have much sight, but little matter to fill it in. Namely, in the
                        division of
                        our communites and people, and how this relates to the lineage of social organization; and the otherwise
                        sensible regards of varied domains. I see this in all walks of life, that the past is too blurrily
                        known;
                        which is to say, that in principle, we can see how it's come, and how the present is merely a current
                        state
                        of that. Then, the way it actualy is, which the past can give much insight to, as some far off case, or
                        the
                        present.

                        The annals of Civ are always changing on me. For so long, the exploration seemed obvious, and Modern an
                        exected mystery; all while we dealt with antiquity. But now, I see that, in distant land goals and
                        infastructural ambition, that there is more you can do in each prior age to set up benefits for the
                        next.
                        And before I state those, I will mention, that barring the civ, it is not a guarentee that you'll have
                        great
                        science or culture in each coming age, and so giving yourself the means to is preferable. By that, less
                        you
                        have the means to do so, set your eye on one side of the sea. Splitting this and going far on both sides
                        is
                        a great ambition, and your science and production may not be up to the task. That, and considering the
                        race,
                        splitting may see you loose both.
                        <br>&emsp;Colesseum is great for happiness, as it adds 2 per quarter. And 3 culture, and a later 2
                        production isn't without relevance.
                        <br>&emsp;Mundo Perdido is great if your in tropical, as it adds 1 science and happiness per said tile
                        ---which could be all.
                        <br>&emsp;If your playing as Joze Diaz, you want Oracle, as the culture per narrative event adds ontop
                        of
                        his own --- plus he has several more.
                        <br>&emsp;Pyramid of the Sun is generally great, as it combines with Colloseum to add 3 culture per
                        quarter.
                        This is a great boon to early exploration.
                        <br>&emsp;The Sanchi Stupa gives 1 culture per 5 excess happiness, locally. Depending on your civ, and
                        assuming you have +5 villa and Arena, you might have upwards of 50 happiness in your captial, meaning 10
                        culture. This scales also as you get even more happiness. At several hundred, your looking at near 50
                        culture, which is a solid and natural occuring boon.
                        <br>&emsp;Borobodur is a key wonder for this, as it adds happiness and food per quater. Combining this
                        with
                        Colesseum, and you have 4 happiness per quarter; which could total near 40 alone.
                        <br>&emsp;The Brihadeeswarar Temple gives all buildings happiness adj. from navigable rivers.
                        <br>&emsp;El Escorial adds relic slots, adds settlement limit ---along with another limit with the
                        mastery--- and gives +4 happiness to every settlement in 7 tiles. This isn't tremedous, but it's still
                        10-20, and things do add up.
                        <br>&emsp;Despite contrasting the price of happiness, specialists are important, and with Notre Dame,
                        which
                        gives a celebration buff to specialists (+3 culture during), so does this pair with your happiness aim
                        and
                        the consquent celebrations.
                        <br>&emsp;Shwedagon adds +2 science to all rural tiles that have at least 1 happiness, which may
                        coincide
                        with your happiness focus.
                        <br>&emsp;White tower gives base 4 happiness, and +4 per tradition, which may be up to 5.
                        <br>&emsp;Chengde Mountain Resort may be the best wonder in the game, giving a flat 5
                        culture per civilization you have a trade route with. Of the 7 available besides you, that's a hard 35

                        Jose is fine, but his narrative bonus only works with pure narrative events, 'not goody huts'. This
                        makes
                        the value of it pan out much sooner. His celebration buff is solid, but requires a strategy that
                        strictly
                        benefits that. He gets no other buff for happiness, and considering his boost towards celebration
                        accruement, it is not so hard to do, and thus, not so limiting.
                        <br>&emsp;If we were Ashoka, we'd get more food from happiness, and more happiness from building
                        adjacency.
                        I think this would improve our yields drastically.
                        <br>&emsp;Maurya are great for their pantheon, and it seems relatively easy to get 50 happiness, and
                        more
                        like 100 once you get villas up. Thats 20 science and gold.
                        <br>&emsp;Despite the strategy being science and gold from happiness, we still ought treat our empire
                        well.
                        We ought respect settlement caps, our science, be it for killing bards or defending oruselves. We have
                        the
                        means to the Sanchi Stupa, and you ought regard this in your adjacency. You do not get boost to
                        districts
                        from Mundi Purdo, so consider the time investment to get a few science and happiness. Colosseum is an
                        eventual gem, and we'll likely go up that tree.
                        <br>&emsp;Colleseum requires district, Sanchi Stupa requires plains, Borobudur requires coast,
                        Brihadeeswarar requires rivers ---and only gives happy adj. to nav rivers. El Escorial requires rough,
                        White
                        tower next to city hall.
                        <br>&emsp;Ashokas ability gives quarters 2 happiness per adj. improvement, and so you ought consider
                        where
                        rough tiles are going; as farms will be replaced. Though, resources act in this way as they are
                        essentially
                        improvements.
                        <br>&emsp;He also gets 1 food for every 5 excess happiness, which is doubled with a memento. I had near
                        30
                        happiness in our captial, which is 12 food. That's alot.

                        So having a bird bath is the way in which our laundry can be done; as i don't care to do it if we
                        haven't
                        showered; nor do I like to do that full on. It's more or less fine without a cloth, but either way.
                        <br>&emsp;Soup is a given, as is corn and bread. Potstickers are fine, as is the occasional springroll.
                        Nor
                        is yogurt poor. But, chips are on the higher end of tier 2, with the natural ones not much lower. Naan
                        is
                        somewhere in the middle, while Battura is near the top. Those peanut crackers are near the foot of tier
                        3,
                        and out of bounds. While soup and quinoa is at the heart of tier 1, and Kale and tomatoes at the root.

                        So I'm thinking of my leisure, and we are in between a few things. THis is alright though, as we have
                        been
                        meaning to go through yoga clips, to then edit.
                        <br>&emsp;There is this corresponding effect of watching things which you please you while your idle;
                        but
                        then your dried up even further. I don't wish to amend then to such things, as if our indolence will
                        stay. I
                        am not against comfort; but besides our work reminding me of where we could improve, so do we have
                        common
                        things to do, like shower, laundry and dishes. If these are done, then flounder away; and let your time
                        and
                        relatively pure interest procure stronger foundations for your work.
                        <br>&emsp;What were missing is a show, as we have Allies, One More Turn and Owl, but nothing to watch in
                        between. This was New Girl for a time, and was Little Fires and Morning Show for a hot a moment. But
                        we've
                        nothing right now; worth accepting at least. We could do Angry Joe, in old reviews or tv shows, but our
                        activity doesn't make this so keen. For the moment, I'd like get our chores done; and luckily I have;
                        and
                        then progress our yoga, 'as the asbcence of our doing it is becoming noticuble'. All the while, we can
                        play
                        Civ; in which, I've noticed the early and later exploration split, as you have more settlement room and
                        thus
                        places you ought eye ought to settle. God Of War is becoming a little slow, but shortly we'll be back
                        into
                        it, and then into something like Jedi Survivor, or Avowed. Red Dead is coming, and Ark and Diablo are
                        there
                        when we please. There may be movies to watch, 'as to supplement our emotional curiosity'. And with
                        delight,
                        like the clouds coming through the spring, I see equal cares, in chartering things, 'seeing them
                        fuller'.
                        Lord of the Rings speaks to me hear, as are the Osprey mountains in need of sense: as the clouds.

                        SO Earth is it's own wing of things, and clearer to remark.
                        <br>&emsp;The Great Migration needs the ending taken off, and a bit of the mid shortened.
                        <br>&emsp;The Western Wall needs shortening in the middle; though, of the main ones in Asia --- Death,
                        secunta, we will succeed-- so could we combine these all into a shorter amount of tracks.
                        <br>&emsp;The Water one's are similar.
                        <br>&emsp;Lazarius can remove the beginning, or at least shorten it: I want the bulk of the track to be
                        the
                        rise.
                        <br>&emsp;I've done this before, but, with the quality version via the full Dark Knight 2 track, I'd
                        like
                        the 'Not a Hero' part by itself.
                        <br>&emsp;There are several for Planet Earth 3, namely the Ostrich one, as it begins nicely, ends
                        greatly,
                        but finishes awkwardly; Mother Octopus needs trimming at the end, while Sea Lions could remove the
                        beginning
                        <br>&emsp;For Mammals, the chimps has calm beginnings and ending, paired nicely with the two birds ones
                        (later in the track). The Micaque heist can be shortened into a nice action piece. I'd like to combine
                        the
                        end of the Arctic with something.
                        <br>&emsp;I also wouldn't mind a rework of Sea of Blue, extending the end, making the rise faster.
                        <br>&emsp;And figuring out how to record vegas while were listening to Youtube is crucial, as we can do
                        so
                        many slow downs, plus Dianne.

                        So this girl Vienna comes up to me and asks me whether I like any movies. I replied, and we spoke about
                        it
                        for a moment. I did not like her, all the while I suspected she did. The next time I saw her, my
                        interest
                        had come to boot, and I felt a little obsessed. We've not spoken since, though I find myself wishing to.
                        But
                        I realize, that it is not about getting her to like you, or even humour the fact that we like her, but
                        to
                        actually speak, share, and learn one another: so that you actually like eachother.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, I imagine her asking me, akin to her swans, if I like to make things. And I'd reply
                        with
                        my care for making books, be it from scratch, or via online, and the joy then of formatting, and having
                        things to read in whole form.
                        <br>&emsp;I'd mention the fact that I love film scores, or soundtracks rather. I also like to edit these
                        songs, and either combine them or cut them up in premiere. One such thing is slow motion, where you take
                        a
                        song, usually with a string/violin, and slow down the track speed/rate. "And it sounds so nice."

                        There is an interest in all of us, to see, be seen, and by that, connect, and through that, be trusted.
                        <br>&emsp;But earning this is no small task; as our natural keeness for this can see us rushing
                        headlong, or
                        at least yearning prior to entry; making the approach a hasty one.
                        <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we need only be ourself, and offer that for whatever corresponding return.
                        <br>&emsp;I see then a girl, whose name is Vienna; and indeed, she feels like a whim of the past. Only,
                        I
                        can see, as grounded as I'd been with Simron, but with a sort of reproach to our insatiety, that we are
                        oppertune for one another. I won't compare myself to other's, but I can say, by the very fact that she
                        likes
                        movies, and in telling me so, was interested in whether I did, and that she makes Oragami, 'for which I
                        can
                        only propose is a reflection of similar interests', that because of this, I feel fair and drawn to give
                        my
                        own cares, be it in reading, writing, the clouds; and the almighty reverence for film score, 'but the
                        all
                        too consistent retreat from letting such be known': to her I'd share.
                        <br>&emsp;But this is not so mucb about her being this grand persona, of which we are so enambered with
                        and
                        finally in sight of. She is simply one, who by our openeness and liberty, and with delight to share. And
                        of
                        all things comfort and sex, ought these been seen like meals, in that, of things good and worth sharing,
                        'ought you primarily wish to share a meal, and be together as that'.
                        <br>&emsp;The cause of this inquiry is such to color our humility and temper, 'for we do wish for
                        dessert'.
                        <br>&emsp;I am etched with a manner then that I have been embellished with in the past; namely, that
                        weary
                        pitch towards written definition. Truly, this may, and surely has, gone to far. But, I see, that the
                        main
                        component of that harsher side, is one where the motions are guided by a fear and or retreat from
                        abscence;
                        and the according effect of forcing work. While the component of the finer side, is one where the
                        interest
                        at hand is a fair one, 'and as one near and lifted by the clouds may wish to better see them, so do we
                        in
                        our current strides wish to take them fully'. The difference being, that we are not simply training our
                        calves so we may run, rather due to nature's pull on me, 'and our care for the scenery around', so do we
                        wish to marble those otherwise driven strides. "For we are in either case forthgone, and right thus to
                        excell more."
                        <br>&emsp;As such, we will let our likes wander, 'as they are free to be, and as such, hold nothing but
                        their nature, as guided by the wind'.
                        <br>&emsp;To round this off, I will state the complexion of liberty; a sentiment which has been long
                        trailing behind me. As we have come from the land north, and settled in the meadows once called home.
                        But as
                        I see this, in all fortune and propiety, that such calmness and joy is not something worth the pretense
                        of
                        leaving for somewhere else; nor fearing that others may wish you to, or repent while you stay. Said folk
                        around may have their own grit and whim, but it is more common than not for them to express their
                        withdrawal
                        of judgement; at least when it comes to the matters in which we've been irksome about before.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, I compare this day to the one's I had as a kid, whereupon our chores being done we
                        went
                        outside, and with the sticks and yard we had, played. Only through age and a begudged response, did I
                        ever
                        feel like leaving. "As if there would not be troble outside our coming door." Relating this to the
                        present,
                        we are indeed more than a child, as we have more than chores which behold us. But equal in that, may we,
                        and, as perhaps a release from pretense, are we given permission, if not very little evidence of
                        judgement
                        being present, as regards our proper treatment of our obligations; and thus sprouting success. And it
                        need
                        not be said that, like our time as a child, our mature response, albeit similar in form, is one in which
                        the
                        fruits match the trunk and deed. "To some extent, as a thinking man, doth the world and her wonder lay:
                        of
                        which, in said field we play." For years mind you I could not help but be drug and irrate about the
                        brambles
                        and stone in such meadow; whereby our weary strides came to be. Now though, despite the grass stretching
                        still as far as the eye can see, am I more near and present to green infront of me. Of which our point
                        of
                        liberty is founded.

                        One of the problems we face is not having anything particularly interesting to share. If someone were to
                        ask
                        me about something specific, I could ask for days.
                        <br>&emsp;But, comapred to most, I struggle bringing things up, and thus resort to bordeom; at least,
                        this
                        sense of getting through the day.
                        <br>&emsp;This is important to me though, as I am not elsewhere occupied, in relation particularly. I
                        don't
                        seek sex or validity truly, but I do wish to make friends and connect.
                        <br>&emsp;The first start is to ask someone about their day. How's it been, how's there shift, anything
                        new
                        or exciting their up to, in past or to come. This is a great deal breaker, as our aim, for them, and
                        from
                        us, is to talk about ourselves.
                        <br>&emsp;I look at Sam then, or Reza, and I see our relationship differently. As we are all together,
                        and
                        things tend to land on work. "We are already talking enough." I would relate then, if a the moment comes
                        to
                        pause, that for them and someone like Josh, to ask them how long they've worked here, if they plan to
                        stay.
                        Something simple like that. For in Joshes case, or someone like Adi, I don't really care to make a
                        friendship with him. "He lacks pretty eyes." But I do find the commradery fair, and instead of awkwardly
                        sitting there, simply ask things about himself: beginning with work. For anyone who has not caught your
                        eye,
                        or your not on some relevant basis, do as such. "For you at least have some common ground." Even offer
                        past
                        work. This is similar to someone's heritage, which I think extends beyond the point, where work would
                        suffice.
                        <br>&emsp;In short, for those you can't compare things with, like gaming with Joey or Tristan, or Andi
                        even,
                        'who you could ask what he's playing', so for those who you wish to relate to and otherwise connect, ask
                        about their day. If that makes you too nervous, regarding Amon for instance, either remark the fact that
                        she
                        is not someone you have any stake for, like Vienna. You may notice her, but feel free to let her pass
                        by;
                        and accept when she does. If your alone together, bring up work. In Vienna's case, smile, say hello, how
                        are
                        you, and if there is a moment, ask her about her day, how it's been, what her shift is. This is enough
                        to
                        talk as were pleased to; and affords any natural point for further discussion; regarding her oragami
                        perhaps, and whether or not she makes more. If that is in fact an interested question, then speak fair
                        and
                        natural: for I need not know so quick or with haste.

                        What ought our judgement be? If it be in suspense, while we tend to our own matters, is this fine? Or
                        ought
                        we be incensed, or stirred at least, by the objects which warrant our judgements being so?
                        <br>&emsp;For it is one thing to say, that if we don't act, as corresponds with judgement, then we will
                        feel
                        the consquence. "Be it in pain upon the wrong choice, or a benefit from the right one." And it is
                        another
                        when we say that such effects are not only probable upon us, but to others.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I stand then, is as one who has been bombarded with judgements. And despite their
                        occurences
                        being less constant than I'd admitt, or would ever in the past, so are they more or less present
                        throughout
                        the times prior, 'be it in scorching heat, or mere sparks of flame'.
                        <br>&emsp;And so, from this, I have been driven out of life's common way; at least, where those
                        judgements
                        rose from. And as such, I formed our own custom and according end. That, and we marbled ourselves with
                        the
                        means to overt further judgements. Indeed, this element holds the heart of our many regards; as we are
                        not
                        always so sure of ourselves, and by that, able to let incoming contentions slide. Nor is it always clear
                        why
                        such inputs are worth overting from; be it in a manner of rebuke or disdain. What I'd say, is that
                        someone
                        who offers a point in haste or with a gust of conviction and certainity, looses my receptivity not on
                        the
                        basis of who they are, as if they weren't someone worth listening to in principle, but instead, within
                        their
                        elated claims, 'too little was said, or at least not enough to warrant the concenrs based on their
                        prediction, nor our need to care for such matters'.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, our entire adolescence has been spent parlaying this problem. For how do you know that
                        their statements are off? Is it so purely on their manner? Cannot someone scream that the sky is blue?
                        <br>&emsp;Of that I can say much, but I will be simple, and in short, remark how our sensibility had
                        always
                        been their in youth, as it most likely is for all: and in a prevailing manner through our later age.
                        Only,
                        despite the claims of others never being convincing, or at least clear in their merrit, so there lacked
                        an
                        alternate truth. It is so easy to ignore and or refute someone if your mind is elswhere bade; but not so
                        much, or so easily rather, if your mind is absent, but for this new suggestion. And indeed, no one's
                        mind is
                        so empty, as you hear things through your early days, and in basic matters, form some conception
                        yourself;
                        which indeed explains some of our overtness in youth; as for the things coming in, in suggestion, of
                        such
                        ideas we already had some; 'of which our un-collesquence of them is not so mysterious'.
                        <br>&emsp;But beyond that, we were really with convictions of the basest sort, and very little when it
                        came
                        to the more complex matters of the world. "In our aims at least." Per our history, we lapsed into
                        nothing,
                        bearing little of what was said, but holding nothing but our basic self. For whatever reason, whatever
                        was
                        there, lead me to actions which corresponded with someone who, cirucamstantially, was only of
                        themselves,
                        and in particular, of someone whose self was kindly fashioned: as I, and many others, would remark my
                        younger years before.
                        <br>&emsp;And we come then to this point, whereby someone offers you something, an idea for instance,
                        and
                        you don't accept because you hold some other belief, but because what is being offered isn't worth
                        listening
                        to. Ultimately, your idea of what would be right, or remark something worth admitting, or at least
                        humouring
                        to a good extent, come's from things you've come to believe prior. "As if some sort of sensibility and
                        reserve was rooted into your baser rungs." And I'd say, that despite this kind and wholesome base, as
                        bed
                        and bound through my early years, that of the broader matters of life, in which my sense was absent, so
                        were
                        we with nothing upon our overtness to what was given. "For all those older and mature, having learned of
                        things that I had not yet been exposed to, offered me such insight prior to me meeting them: as if to
                        prepare me, in principle and advantage." I will not say much about their suggestions regarding such
                        coming
                        matters, only, that of the matters to come, so were my concerns of them different. For in many ways,
                        such
                        concerns seemed rooted in the desire for certain things: a desire which I little held. "And the
                        contention
                        that arose based on our lack of action, was so, not on the validity of such actions --as I felt-- but
                        rather
                        the point of them, whose ends I did not care for."
                        <br>&emsp;From this, we were left with no ends whose actions we'd find warrant in doing. And much of the
                        dissaray in our life came from this fact: that we in effect did nothing. Much of our depression and
                        doubt
                        was born from this also.
                        <br>&emsp;Bringing this together then, we have someone who, by their genial upbringing, the turmoil
                        which
                        rose throughout by those rearing, and our otherwise blend of honest and kind regard, led me to feel
                        unresolved in the mighty efforts esteemed for common ends. We never let go though, and always held
                        ourselves
                        responsible to this abscence, 'never pretending like things were well'. We dreamed, and in part via
                        narcotics; nor were we lacking stubborness or recklessness. But as time went on, 'where our empty
                        placement
                        amidst the common path threw us about', that so did we at subsquent points amend. Be it our parents, our
                        resolve in life, and further things of the sort.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, where I've come from and how I am, is born through this process. All though, to this
                        matured and current point, 'about how I should be in our current place, as one so esteemed and free: yet
                        lacking the kind of resolve and cares that others of similar esteem do'.
                        <br>&emsp;I find it hard to say whether my completion bades such intent, or if we are merely to further
                        refine our personal state, and from there, 'fully proceed'.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed the problem of philosphy lies, 'as the truth ought bring you to the point of all
                        things: or
                        maybe it levels you ought to begin'.

                        So, 8 hours is the max. I'd rather not work at 9, but the earlier shifts are less likely. I think that 5
                        is
                        the earliest, though 9 is fine too. In that, we've got 10-2 as the end range. It is either 5-1 or 6 till
                        2.
                        I suspect if we the former we will get less shifts. And I am inclined to get enough, even if we start at
                        9.
                        I think that were less likely to get any in the early hours, as there are simply not enough; and likely
                        taken by others.
                        <br>&emsp;I simply want to work more days, and keep it to 5 hours. Two days is rather sufficient, as
                        would 3
                        be. We seem to only be getting the 1 morning shift; which is nice, but leaves me a little bit kept to
                        ourself. Which is fine, but the idea that we could see others, and connect; with Vienna namely, is
                        important.
                        <br>&emsp;Right now, our availability is monday, friday and Saturady 3-1, and this is gaining me full
                        shifts. I don't mind them, but prefer short, and more of them.

                        I notice that when our food reserves fall, the aerobic load on us makes me ill. There may be fat
                        reserves
                        also, but this ought supplement your normal glycemic load. Otherwise, your body must transition to

                        The reality of civ is that victory requires nothing more than the specified means to an end, and the
                        general
                        basis to faciliate this.
                        <br>&emsp;It is now known that the legacy paths influence such ends very little, but instead contribute
                        towards their faciliation. Economics for instance, has the purpose of providing more gold, which may be
                        of
                        interest to you for purchasing buildings and or units throughout the game.
                        <br>&emsp;It is worth noting that the legacy paths do have rewards that allow such faciliation, be it in
                        skill points or strict perks. Exploration science for instance can provide 3 culture per quarter, giving
                        a
                        nice boost to your early modern development.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, as we play, we ought consider our end. If were going for Railroad Tycoon, then we
                        want as
                        many settlements and resources as possible; along with more gold as to purchase buildings to get the
                        factory
                        points going.
                        <br>&emsp;Culture is relatively simple, as you only need to build explorers. You will need to reach the
                        end
                        of the main civic tree to unlock more artifacts, so having a fair culture is good.
                        <br>&emsp;It also cannot be overlooked, that beyond potential boosts, that competiion can result in war,
                        and
                        thus you need some basic semblence of science in order to keep up with military; and culture adds ontop
                        of
                        this.
                        <br>&emsp;For science, you merely need that, plus several cities with solid enough production to do the
                        projects, and then the rocket launch. I believe Fascism offers a boost to projects, and perhaps a wonder
                        does to, or civic at that.
                        <br>&emsp;Dominion is it's own bag of tricks, as you must have a different ideology than your
                        competitor. At
                        least, if you have the same, then you need to capture 10 settlements, whereas, if their different, then
                        you
                        only need capture 5. This can be planned for, as you eye a smaller target, deliberatley wait and choose
                        an
                        opposing ideology, then assualt them.
                        <br>&emsp;The reality of civ, in summary, is that all these things can be achieved with relative
                        simplicity.
                        But, the truth of the matter, is that low science, gold, culture and production drag down your means to
                        do
                        so, making it a slow process. Anyone can win a game of civ, in this version or the last. But doing so
                        well,
                        and with pace, requires a good deal of development. This is what the game is for, as doing well means
                        you
                        can linchpin victory; or, you will have to take your time, and find means to increase your pace.
                        <br>&emsp;I will note, that resources play a huge role in your civilization. If you mean to play off
                        happiness, then you want as much wine and later on furs for the corresponding celebrations. If your
                        playing
                        military, then you want lots of silver, and teas in modern age if your going for science. This benefits
                        from
                        settlements and or trade, and reflects a very directed approach through the game; as you can look at and
                        prepare for later needs. Wonders are no different; the colossus for instance, and it's boon of gold;
                        along
                        with Monks Mound, and both their resource increase, for the sake of more factory products.

                        So, be it in the civil realm, or military one, injury and or misfortune of other's is a hard pill to
                        swallow. For you see them hurt, or at least in pain, suffering and or begrieved. And it is hard, 'like a
                        wounded animal who you cannot aid', in being so near, yet so far and unable to intervene.
                        <br>&emsp;This is the promise of literature then, or media rather, as to both show what is so far, and
                        through that, elicit some response 'for those who'd deem themselves otherwise far away'.
                        <br>&emsp;We must talk impact though, as someone saying something small is, in both principal and to
                        some
                        degree practice, effective; as it is so, that a penny into the stock nudges every so much.
                        <br>&emsp;The point then is not that our actions should be dissauded and or perrmited to dismiss far off
                        concerns, or at least those whose impact by us is penny like; but we ought remain rational and
                        controlled,
                        as not to think things are otherwise. "We ought midly share one's foreign despair; and use this as an
                        ultimate decree to move ourselves for their favor, however slightly."

                        I think deep down, we are all with the opinion that we have some true ideal; and when we see things that
                        conflict we that, we deem such things wrong, and the perpetrators as bad. For we have so much experience
                        which tailors us, and like pasta being unwound and sifted by a hand, 'so doth books and media lay'.
                        <br>&emsp;The question then, is why are our own views so combative against the appearence of others? Is
                        it
                        so much that the holocaust was worht our sympathy that we feel merely so, or is it the wrongness which
                        spurss us; to be deemed so, and thus replaced by our apparent truth.
                        <br>&emsp;For I do not know how many rights we should have, whether women and men are different, and by
                        that, deserved different treatment. Nor do I know the proper conduct of things, or, as regards
                        providence
                        and death, how we should remark and prepare. "This world has never stopped being a mystery."
                        <br>&emsp;But I lie then, exposed to the conservatism of Arabia, the authority in China, the esteemed
                        hold
                        of Putin in Russia, the chimeric depratvities of Africa, nor the bearuacry of the developed world. The
                        question though, is whether we should admitt ourselves to this complexity, and offer a sort of
                        developement
                        to it, as to further progress what is ideal and true, and by that, slim down the impurity of these
                        things.
                        Or, ought we apply ourselves to the wounded, to the fires raging? In many ways, all services operate on
                        this
                        level; as one in need of a bacon burger is alike one in need of suturing: the difference though, is
                        despite
                        the value domain, one is on the novel side of comfort and treatment, the other on the end of pestulence.
                        "Which is so hard to attest, and amend."

                        The deepest thing I know, is that if I remain unoccupied, then I will think or act in accordance with
                        stillness; and from that, orient ourselves to some potential future; as if to ideally, or in remedy,
                        paint a
                        time beyond our solitude.
                        <br>&emsp;In being at work for a short while, I can see how having something in mind, regarding
                        itinerary
                        and effort that is, is an adornment to our lives; along with seeing other people, and the common peace

                        comes from seeing others and being known, and the more lively matter of desiring and or seeing from our
                        active time.
                        <br>&emsp;In acceptance, I somewhat malign myself with futile intent. All the while though, I admitt
                        rightly
                        of the liberty in this lane; whereby we see how, fairly, and in practice, we see outward from this
                        ordained
                        spot. "While our unoccupied state has no such position, and thus feels embalemed to all: be it in
                        imposition
                        as our brace upon the world squanders; or in rigthoues probitity, whereby we overt our indolence and
                        according strife, by bearing motions to the entirety around: such is a large localle though." As such,
                        our
                        set and governed state holds a sort of measure, by which all things see are impressed upon our arranged
                        state; and do not draw us to be arranged per the impression, as when were not arranged aleady.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a simple truth then, that who I am and am pleased by, comes from a sort of denial of
                        all
                        things absent or contrary to what I feel dear. "I care not for your guidance in which I'd recieve a boat
                        and
                        home: my love is already spent."

                        I do not contend that our understanding and views of things is entire. And as I'd listen to a doctor
                        regarding an illness, so do I hear from those learned in all fields about the matters in such fields.
                        Those
                        on televsion are merely members of their respective breed, and can offer some semblence of their
                        according
                        domain. But it is not so difficult to see, that of the direction and ways of televsion, that so are
                        those
                        matters (as per the one, in a domain, regarding the according matters), given in extent and gait, by
                        such
                        according ways. "T.V does not bend itself to the content, but the other way around."
                        <br>&emsp;In this, I will say, that I've read the histories, and can state the general development from
                        matter to the globe; from Eukaryia to man, and Rome to Modern London. There are holes in my sight, along
                        with strands which are but a glimmer. But I will say, by virtue of sense and our principle in being
                        reserved, that what I see on T.V, and online media too, is of the words and pleas of those representing
                        us,
                        the people. Their actions, or at least the actions which correspond with them, are not absent either;
                        but
                        this may be best described as a conclusive resolve. "As one may seek a change of sort, and pass some
                        sort of
                        policy or alteration in conduct, of which we can say their attempt is bade." But the thing which
                        Televsion
                        does so poorly, and is by my accounts found fully only through more deliberate measures, is how such
                        resolves actually effect the world. For it is so hard to speak to any one person's circumstance; and
                        even if
                        you do, how this remarks other peoples lives. It is hard to appreciate people's means to bear load,
                        handle
                        burdens, and otherwise make do with what they have.
                        <br>&emsp;I will give an instance where Television offered something, yet gave little of which you would
                        be
                        best to receive. They stated, that from last year, assaults against paramedics had risen by 40.. They
                        did not mention any actual figure, as if it went from 70 to 100. They mentioned not what the increase
                        was
                        from the year prior; for the average yearly increase may have been relatively low, indicating a sudden
                        shift, or it may
                        have been rising in comparatively high numbers for several years prior. In a word, they spoke to a
                        problem which had
                        some potential cause; and that this was a point of evidence in that favour. To me, this evidence lacks
                        supporting points
                        to see a) what it actually is, as you don't know actual amounts, and b) the actual significance of this
                        problem, for if
                        it was 7,000 to 10,000, then I'd say the issue was astronomical, and only increasing; while it being 7
                        to 10 is not so
                        earthshatering to me.
                        <br>&emsp;Ultimately, Donald Trump has imposed Tarrifs on Canada, effecting us Canadians and Americans.
                        Whether that is
                        for the better of his country I do not know. But of all the effects upon us, which are basic rights are
                        a kindred sort,
                        so do all causes apply. And from that, my cares are onto people and the quality of their experience, not
                        the actions of
                        those who, fairly, but also thrugh esteem, create much impact. Donald Trump has not rearranged the bulk
                        of America's
                        laws, and we ought rememeber that the effects of those is not to be forgotten. In some sense, and I say
                        this while being
                        coy, but it seems that we almost forget this fact because, of all the causes upon us, we care little of
                        their evident
                        and or supposed effects. "We just go about our day, adjusting as we do, and finding the good upon our
                        stability: which
                        is something that is not itself given, but ours to partake upon our more obligate actions." We forget
                        this though, and
                        upon hearing some new impediement, think we'll notice or care any more than we do of the things already
                        long by our
                        side. "Will this not be similar."
                        <br>&emsp;I don't know where this hatred in our hearts comes from. I suspect it lies in the similar
                        tangles of our wish
                        to be right, and make sure other's know it. The point is not to admitt and or ignore the acts of other
                        people, 'be it in
                        thiefs or depsots', but not to let ourselves to be unravelled and blinded, 'as if such people are so
                        dastardly as we
                        deem, or are the soul problem of the world'. I simply have no mature and or respectable approach which
                        sparks such an
                        attitude in me. The world is simply too complex to, upon consideration, hold such anger and or according
                        response. Nor,
                        in the deeper and or natural impressions, 'by records and being outside', am I eleicted to even see such
                        a response as
                        neccessary. "For there is generally not much going on, besides those points where it is. And typically,
                        it is car
                        accidents and domestic dispute: which in my view, is not so easy to blame the president for."

                        Our way of life is such, that our expenses are small, nor our demands a burden. We've made choices that
                        have
                        brought us close to our family. And despite this reflecting a younger position, so have the years
                        brought me
                        in and out of such things; and to those times when I was on my own, so were the circumstances similar. I
                        am
                        employed, with peers, a schedule, and a generous regulation of our mode of living; as to faciliate our
                        interests, and peacefully oblige such employment.
                        <br>&emsp;This course of ours came from the north, where we spent much time living in peace and
                        stillness.
                        This was shuffled when we moved back to our younger home; but through some time and effort, the peace
                        has
                        returned, but with more welcomed activity. The lands are getting warmer, our leisure is coming about,
                        and
                        our means for study and creation are only getting clearer and stronger.
                        <br>&emsp;I see that we are indeulably lucky, for we live in Canada, are at liberty to be passive in
                        conquest, submissive upon another's. We pay taxes and are subject to laws (and consequent penalty), but
                        so
                        do we receive an array of services, along with a realm of economy as to produce things pleasing to us.
                        "And
                        in that, lies even more oppertunity, to discipline ourselves, and earn even more pleasing things."
                        <br>&emsp;Our way has come from our choices, which have come from choices prior and their ordainment via
                        our
                        constitution. Such form is hard to explain, though the observations of our developed years show enough
                        as to
                        either susepct the cause of such points, or at least coallesque with the point of those motions; which,
                        however long after produced from some far hidden truth, are themselves a far memory, and more fair to
                        consent to; as if they were the base.
                        <br>&emsp;For all my writing, I see little which has enveloped this present point; for in some ways, it
                        is
                        the thing which goes unspoken, and in it's obscurity, and the rleations of the world around which are so
                        accordingly unclear, so of those things do we state: but not the thing which their obscurity was lacking
                        clarity for.
                        <br>&emsp;I mentioned this shortly ago, but the basis of me is that I hold on interest or care that is
                        born
                        under obligation; as if some things are good as they are in relation to a burdened state. Nor, do I
                        admitt
                        anything as being futile or false, as per the norm, some burden will forbid it. My experience is that
                        most
                        of our burdens are made up, not on a reasonable basis, but by our lapse of action as would produce the
                        goods
                        we truly seek. But, via tradition and its flakes of ignorance, so are we stirnly told, and in that,
                        emablemd
                        with our derisive response; which, in effect, only leads us away from the esteemed truths pressed upon
                        us.
                        "I never held such things in esteem; and thus ran no where."
                        <br>&emsp;I could be more clear, and over time will, but I will say, that of that last point, so is the
                        relevant fact, that in our un-submisson of the esteemed truth, and our lack of movement elsewhere, that
                        we
                        bade ourselves in such a stilled stated as to see what was better and true; as such a way was
                        motioneless,
                        and thus lacking of any comfort or good, nor lacking doubts and or contrition from others. We were
                        motivated
                        thus.
                        <br>&emsp;Thus lies our adolescene, where we admitted none of the burdens around me, nor held any
                        complete
                        truth of what was either a) good to seek, or b) a means to do so.
                        <br>&emsp;Our choices though, as reminsecent of our lack of fufillment in such a way, as some moments
                        and
                        places in it were not so developed or pleasing, were made along such lines; and via our lack of
                        satisfaction, and the lingering sense of shame and contempt by others --who say me doing nothing, even
                        in
                        our finer states-- lead me to live with our goal in mind, but with respect to the deeds neccessary to
                        provide for it. Indeed, the root of our adolescence was in the nature of wish, which was to be as we
                        often
                        experienced, in flourishing pleasnentry, and how in such ways, we were entirely alone. Naturally, we
                        were
                        raised and acquainted in and to a home; and of such place, we sought never to leave. There is a prickly
                        truth to this, in that, of our cares, so were we protective of them, and by that composure, timid and
                        meak
                        regarding other potential things. But alas, in our reserved interests, so did we merely wish to be at
                        home:
                        for we beleived nothing else was required.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, our choices have led us back home. And of the good we seek, so is it evidently
                        squanced by our inacitivity and lack of occupation. For in that, we feel unrightful in our place at
                        home,
                        and a little pathetic accordingly. Much of my years have felt like this, and although not so prevalent,
                        so
                        do the strides of dreams and glory come up, 'as if to assure us of some future beyond this anxious
                        habition'. But alas, we are home, employed, making some money, for novel purchase or later saving. We
                        are
                        quite kept and aligned to our homely deeds, and personal desire.
                        <br>&emsp;Were going to fail again though, as our time often bids. You see, in our inactivity, there
                        lies no
                        romance or friends. And by that, we are ever too aware of ourself and things, and prone to irrate
                        perfection; as to validate our belonging, and furnish our solitary ease.
                        <br>&emsp;What I would say, is that life has many ends, and of the weeks near and ahead, so ought to
                        truly
                        amend. For we are off till Friday, and again till the next. Of those shifts they are early, and so any
                        weakness in our hunger will have several breaks to deal with. I also think that eating properly the
                        night
                        before, 'as if to properly fill', can help your short shifts. I mean to run well if not often. We have a
                        small stool in order to do pullups, and we may do a whole manner of exercises around this. We are true
                        to
                        eat more and at least constant, and our yoga is quite ordained to our sense, and proactively so through
                        our
                        coming guides.

                        We are left then with nothing to speak about except for desire. As I would absolutely love to gorge my
                        face
                        right now, watch porn even or smoke. But I know, that in our fortuity to the deeds of God and Man, that
                        if I
                        slunder and sludge my way through that, then I will not ever reach what I mean to succeed.
                        <br>&emsp;Where the trouble lies, is when I have no such view of success, but am rather emabalmed with
                        the
                        peace from stability, and the glowing edge and it's light. This has succoured me for an age. But we
                        still
                        keep on, denying that we seek romance, 'as if our love of the sun ever matched that of a woman'.

                        And
                        as we hanker over that and respond, so will our sights and ability for others, 'who in our finer strides

                        see and like', so such ends will be gone. "Seemingly at least."

                        So our judgements are parsed on the accounts we give of the world.
                        <br>&emsp;This is not to say that were so tight and set on such accounts, 'as if we had, or at least
                        knew,
                        some rule of nature which goverened our walking, and the basis of the ground below'.
                        <br>&emsp;But we are left with someonewhat contrary opinions, from near and far.
                        <br>&emsp;And oddly, this is not a familiar experience to most, as the matter of truth has always been
                        more
                        or less equal to all. There was fighting and or progression, 'but from a level acceptence'. Indeed,
                        man's
                        notable flaw is being so sure, yet bearing results which reflect not.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, it fairs one most to be able to state that they approve; for the abscence of
                        another's
                        understanding of what you feel to be right or wrong, means that you must be forthcoming in your belief.
                        For
                        you generally don't have to convince people, but express what your free to see. "In many ways, and as
                        regards our parents, this matters most, that the bombardment of suggestions we recived tends to come
                        because
                        our own mind and feelings seem unmade. It is wise then to be able in stating that your are clear and
                        resolved. At least, remarking that you are not unsure of things nor your goal, but perhaps not clear on
                        the
                        means to reach it."
                        <br>&emsp;This may serve you fully, as given your sanctiety to be so sure and accordingly resolved, you
                        need
                        merely state that you are fine and consenting to your course and way.
                        <br>&emsp;But as regards the accounting, whereby you may have to defend your view of the facts, or at
                        least,
                        in freedom, speak to the fact that of your account of things, you either see them differently then is
                        being
                        supposed or imposed, and that, as such, any elements your missing are of those which you actually see;
                        as if
                        the figure I am undefined on is it's own matter compared to the undefintion of some other figure.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, matters of fact may be used to state a prediction; or you may feel some future
                        sense
                        based on an impression of fact. If you are in a progressive state, which claims little but merely asks,
                        then
                        you have only your doubts to even; as surrounding absolutists, or those ardent in their views, can make
                        your
                        own uncertain approach a weary one.
                        <br>&emsp;Similarly though, it must be that the past and present blend together with the future; and
                        thus,
                        if an observation is had, so ought prior one's not be forgotten. Nor is it sound or likely that if we
                        were
                        grappling with past observations, that we'd be in a state that needed recall; for new observations would
                        be
                        put ontop of our weighed down state; rather than being something later used to calm our alerted
                        reaction.
                        <br>&emsp;And again, the world is exposed to me in ways, that in their fine properties, so am I
                        unacquainted
                        with most of it, nor with delight in the matter. This is true. But this is not our common world being
                        hit by
                        the embers of the world around, but our far off scope heeding the glimmer of nearer and more
                        concentrated
                        rays. It is not pollution or a disturbance, merely an expression of certain facts and our own percepton
                        of
                        judgement.
                        <br>&emsp;At the end of the day the news is so, that of the world we live in, so are chocies, by menace
                        or
                        not, made to others good or not so fortune. Our own case is by natural privalage or local decree fine.
                        But
                        so is there something true in the reaction to potential conflict or the trauma of someone injured afar,
                        that
                        reflects our own aimlessness; or at least the flatness of our progressive mean. So it offers me well,
                        and
                        perhaps, in the whole of entirety, reflects old nerves and current insolidity, that we are so put off by
                        the
                        very (albeit course) presentation of this fact. "That things are not so entirely well."

                        It is clear right now, that our 'progressive approac' is nobly esteemed, yet, not so conclusive in it's
                        end.
                        Be it through education or active service, our goal ought be one that is real and definite. The progress
                        is
                        in what we offer, not that we would offer. There is no qualm with not offering; our experience only
                        shows
                        that, per our time and occupation, so do we feel like it; as we find much ground and comfort in learning
                        about the world and seeing it for what it is. Glory may have been sought, but only now do we see other's
                        far
                        away, and with equal regard as someone that we know nearby. "They are both equal in that they are apart
                        from
                        us."
                        <br>&emsp;It may be so that in our reflections that we iron out our judgements and become set in
                        something
                        full and true. "Indeed a great deal of our time has been spent abasing alterante truths, so as not to
                        weigh
                        on our lack of sure judgement." But, as much as you are in suspence, and find yourself reflecting in a
                        broader way, keep an end in mind, or at least point of it all. "Not so that you would in fact be so
                        occupied, but in the form of your remarks; that they would hold some course on route to the truth." It
                        seems
                        to me, that such truth is what you seek because you lack your own understanding. "Which by fortune and
                        state, is ours to have." Yet, our lack of clarity there, yet bond with it in terms of what is near and
                        of
                        such a form in me, makes for our seeking truth, 'as if to offer guidance and or repell input around'.
                        <br>&emsp;Our time then, by our way and concern, is from, and with reciept from, reflection and real
                        inquiry: whereby the end is both sought and maturely approached: and not, as it's been, too enclosed on
                        one
                        or the other.

                        I'd state that there is not but our quest for right and wrong. But such a feat comes by our indefined
                        measure of good. I sense it, in many ways know it, but cannot fully exclaim; and thus our oppertunities
                        are
                        less gripped, nor impositions upon us so easily passed off.
                        <br>&emsp;This is so, for of our roots I do not know. I have admittedly thought little of our youngest
                        years, nor our true strides in youth. All I have stated, and have more clarity to remark, is the result
                        of
                        such motions: the culmination of how we were raised.
                        <br>&emsp;For in that rearment to took to so little. And due to the reality of such rearment being one
                        of
                        indpenedment oblige, so was the matter of that oblige a weight upon me. Our rearing was, so for
                        neccessity
                        and further benefit, we could accordingly oblige. But as that time came, 'where we were off to the
                        wilds, or
                        at least to the further means in preperation', we were ill-resigned.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, in being in such a grown up state, and in the world as corresponded with that, we
                        were
                        so ill-fit. I duly obliged, living as I could without respecting such deeds, and otherwise consenting to
                        them as I could.
                        <br>&emsp;It would seem that the world demands something of you, and be it as a farmer who get's by, or
                        a
                        king who holds much in excess of that, so must we oblige.

                        So we were young once, and quite set in our deeds and ways. I recall not all things feeling so
                        weightless;
                        but our sense onf consequence was rather bare. I did feel certain elements, maybe during one small
                        aspect of
                        school, or some chore at home, in which there were stakes in the matter. But besides our behaviour, we
                        were
                        generally free.
                        <br>&emsp;As we got older though, beyond pride and our sense of what was good and proper, so did we
                        begin to
                        feel the effects of our efforts. For in school namely, our grades were something we had to present
                        almost,
                        'and more or less prove that we were doing things well'. Later on, we were equally pushed to get
                        employed;
                        be it for money or life skills; or to remove this sense that --during the summer for instance-- we
                        weren't
                        doing anything at all.
                        <br>&emsp;Despite our weakness in all of this, and our admitted lack of complexity (in this reflection),
                        I
                        can say that our views of most things, be it cars, university or girls, was such, that of the route
                        towards
                        such things and the involvements which procurred them, so were we not bethrothed to any of them in and
                        of
                        themselves. There was this pressure to do so, in both our cynical doubts and scoured expressions from
                        those
                        near to us; and thus, that idea of enrollment and a plan felt like a token as to not be so scowled upon.
                        "But it became so, that this sense of liberty because we were so rightfully invovled, gave no way to any
                        constance or committment to such things: as we were stubborn in doing things for the sake of it: nor
                        absent
                        of other developments as time went on."

                        Hey Dev, just had a question regarding availability. I've seemingly hamstrung myself in looking for 5
                        hours
                        shifts ---or not the full 8 ones. I understand that you can pick up shifts, but that's random. I'm not
                        concerned about money, but I've enjoyed seeing everyone at work, and having the 1 shift per week feels
                        like
                        I'm never seeing any of them.
                        <br>&emsp;I'm thinking of just opening my schedule to everyday, while keeping the limit on short shifts.
                        I
                        know this cuts me off from shifts I'd otherwise get, but I hope by doing this I'll get more than 1 per
                        week.
                        The few weeks before this I was getting two 5 hours, and that worked great.
                        <br>&emsp;I bring this up because were limited in availability requests. My understanding is you get 5
                        per
                        year. I'm wondering if my initial availbility input counts towards that, when I was first hired? Do I
                        get 5
                        more after that? Also, is it 5 requests a year from the day you start, or just till the end of the year?
                        If
                        I started in November, and I did several requests, does it repeat January 1st?
                        <br>&emsp;Overall, I'm really enjoying my time in the department. Everyone is great, and as I said, I
                        would
                        just like to see them more. And despite having my own personal efforts and things to do, working 1 shift
                        per
                        wekk still feels too little. It seems that these past shifts I've been doing grocery picks, which has
                        been
                        great. I know that produce is a very delicate thing, and that certain folk hold your trust to do so. But
                        be
                        it for fridge, freezer, grocery, large or cleanup, I'm equally able for each. And I also don't mind
                        doing
                        the backroom if that's what you need.

                        We tend not to do this anymore, those whole feeling regards. For such remarks tend to come in strife,
                        'whereupon our foundation is under load'.
                        <br>&emsp;The years have been kind to me, and our baser mentions have ceased.
                        <br>&emsp;We are to go in at 430 this and the following Friday, and then at 6 the following. We are fine
                        and
                        able to do this.
                        <br>&emsp;Our health is such, that in our might, we are feeling higher; if only from the efforts at
                        work.
                        Our yoga though is murdering our otherwise free-time, and not benefiting either our finer capacities as
                        our
                        work would benefit from. Our eating lessens because of this, as we care not to eat so much, nor so
                        wholly.
                        But alas, our common time is fine, in our walks and reading, writing and song. Games, vids and film are
                        not
                        lacking either. And, it would seem, that our yoga is returning, in both sentiment and furry. And thus
                        our
                        elected activities are further shining. "As are the near coming's of spring and her bloom."
                        <br>&emsp;Choice is ultamitaltey are meaning in life; as we alot our time and effort for something which
                        is
                        deemed as such. But our judgements, as to foster such choice, are never so clear or tight. And so, per
                        our
                        way, is it at least deamed good if it prompts and faciliates such inquiries: as to further refine what
                        you
                        see and know, and thus make it more simple and dear to amend.

                        Let us move away from the motions of old, where we thought that, through true and ripe action, that we'd
                        be
                        part of the world, a leader, one of glory and cheer. Nor, let us be so mistaken to think, that if
                        someone
                        other, or any fortune for that matter, were it in our otherwise personal life, that such life would
                        change
                        but for their prescence. "As if this meal had this new item added, yet was otherwise the same."
                        <br>&emsp;For it seems, that things of the sort, in all their worth and desire, come by action and
                        chance.
                        For you ought not press it to be, nor yearn upon its abscence; merely let the chance come up, and let
                        your
                        words slip as they are calm and pleased to.
                        <br>&emsp;As always our life is our own. And indeed, maybe through prior choices we would have procurred
                        what we seek now. But such interests are merely of something now, and presently striking. As your wish
                        is
                        fdufulled, you seek again. And by our sweet memory, and I retain our efforts to compose ourselves to the
                        good already had. The moral, is that this reserve, or at least appreciable action, is by its extremes a
                        limitation to all other things: as you choose otherwise, or feel to odd to be open about it. But this
                        need
                        not be so; and in fact, the sense we have of things, whereby we are right and good for the stability and
                        cheer in this, gives us room in our hearts to be at peace, but also share. "we ought be happy that we
                        are
                        proceeding so lightly through the world: but not so remorsed as to the precedent of the world not yet
                        being
                        ours."

                        There is this line, whereby we lean far forward if we are in front of it, or sink nicely into our depths
                        as
                        much as we are behind it.
                        <br>&emsp;The truth though, is this is not some symmatry, but remark about what's realistic for someone
                        to
                        do. "As some propel themseles into their very depths: the monks."
                        <br>&emsp;All I've noticed over the years are the evident matters that leave me whole and flourishing if
                        attended to. Accordingly, our regards are nearer to us, rather than those far away.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, this deeper station brings with it a sort of rich cheer: more or less by you
                        starting
                        from so far down, that your rise is only higher. You may not always see above the surface though, while
                        attending to such depths. But, in bearing our regards to such roots, the cares beyond get dissovled.
                        "Those
                        whose concerns are so far beyond themselves end up needing and or seeking the world. While one with
                        inner
                        peace finds much joy, and thus calm, in the world outside their door." This is our mature state.
                        <br>&emsp;The grandest thing to describe though, is when our equinimity within deeper regards keeps with
                        me
                        as we partake in farther matters. Quite literally, the life of a monk or philosopher is so, that their
                        efforts are committed to themselves; and thus, of people and comfort, so are these deemed contrary. Or,
                        in
                        our case, 'our choices don't bring us by their side'.
                        <br>&emsp;And the point is, like someone who exercises runs better, that so in our common strides, when
                        we
                        take them from those depths, but in a way that is gracefull with respect to our harmony in such depths,
                        that
                        the natural motion born of this in the farther domain are such, as to be so commiserate per that domain
                        --of
                        what is normal there-- but with a sort of candor and life brought up from those deeper harmonies. "A
                        painting works this way, in that, of the deeper blends and faded harmonies in the back, the more clear
                        and
                        detailed objects in the front seem even moreso, and at that better, from the depths they settle upon."
                        <br>&emsp;In that, pure sense tells me to bring such harmonies forth; in that, of what your asked for,
                        be it
                        strenght, or what your drawn to, be it other people or amends, let the embers and hues from beneath
                        flavor
                        what you offer. "For as such, during conversations, what I care for and am inclined towards, and thus
                        apt to
                        share, stems from such depths."
                        <br>&emsp;As these depths can feel obscure and or private, so do the goods of them become entangled with
                        the
                        knots they sit upon. "For dealing with our deepest selves can be a messy or at least prolonged affair:
                        and
                        not one which you want to share." But of such goods, ought they be the elements of your broader aims and
                        converse. For instance, the music we listen to is that which mingles, or is at least with our approval,
                        in
                        terms of our heart and it's motion. Of such heart, so in our finer times did we find music to match
                        that.
                        But, where the two paths differ, is if our heart is off, we tend to that, rather than finding music to
                        either remedy that, or fit into to your lessened state. "No complacent interests or delight from me." We
                        may
                        hide our care for treating our broken heart, and thus, the music which we care for when it is at peace,
                        and
                        by our decree towards such peace and the according belief in this being right and natural to achieve, so
                        do
                        we assume the complexion of our cares, in that, of the heart were tending, and the reservation to share
                        this, so do we not share the music we like when our heart is not broken.
                        <br>&emsp;My life is such, that of our broken heart, so were we given comforts by our circumstances. As
                        we
                        were young, around folk who needed little, and so we induleged in such. But when those circumstances
                        were
                        less giving, we didn't work to earn our own ointment, but rather fix the impetus for it.
                        <br>&emsp;In many ways, there is a long line of tradition; one in which, of the goods in life, so are
                        they
                        marshalled under the veil of problems, and the according remedy and or means. Such means were what we
                        were
                        judged by in our less-dependant years.

                        So, taking a vertical slice of my life, I was in my early youth, or at least in an era of youth, and the
                        notion of 'the future' and the according responsabilities and preperation for it were becoming part of
                        the
                        nomenclature. "Like we were being reared for something."
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, our idea of success was not in how well we partook in such ventures, or that we'd
                        get
                        the rewards esteemed by them; but, based on the consquence and shame in not being so ordained, and to an
                        extend so rewarded, so were we pleased and happy to be on such path: but for the sake of the path
                        itself, in
                        that it was one that other's approved of, along with the clarity which came from being on a path at all.
                        <br>&emsp;The thing to note though, is that this sentiment was so throughout our growing years, in that,
                        of
                        a job for instance, we were always elated to get one for the approval we'd get upon getting it: rather
                        than
                        anything actually offered by the job. And again, this came from the consternaton by our parents when we
                        lacked such goals or employment; along with our friends being so ordained, and increasingly effective in
                        it.
                        Our self confidence also was teatered on this, as we felt somewhat lame and hollow if we weren't so
                        arranged; and this kept me closed of to girls and potential friends, as we were more inclined to live so
                        poorly on our own.
                        <br>&emsp;The truth in all this though, is that our response to all of this was not one of real care or
                        achievement, but security, 'as to feel safe that we were doing the right thing'. But in this came much
                        procrastination, and an otherwise presentation of us seeming directed. We had not definite goal for
                        post-secondary, nor did we care for a job until it was clear that lacking one was unacceptable. I did
                        not
                        even care for parties and women; at least as I found them. Through the years, I cared only for food,
                        movies,
                        sports and games. And any of this which had competition or esteem on it, made me step back. I could play
                        scrimmage soccer all day: but showing up for an hour long league match had me either full of nerves, or
                        longing for the game to be cancelled; and, equally, a relief when the season was over. I just felt more
                        obliged than drawn to such efforts. And school and our social life, as it felt so fashionably or vainly
                        demanding, had me equally overt. Too, our sense of all this was quite cynical; which I compare to one
                        who is
                        young and in love, but in being to afraid to admitt it, says the whole idea (or person even) is stupid.
                        Procastination indeed.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, circumstance has eroded our natural perspacity in life. As, upon our moves, or the
                        eroding of our childhoood cares (along with everyone around), what was new and common delighted me not;
                        and
                        so, for the sake of preservation, rather than finding some new success, we ordained. And it is not
                        unimportant to note, that based on how lacking our interest was, that we made decisions that seemed
                        accomodating to our 'wish for preservation'. "Of those and what not around, I leaned away."
                        <br>&emsp;And so, our adolescence came to be, as the years of our 'compliant efforts' was no longer
                        sufficeinet in their merely complient way. During highschool, we had such pressurs upon us, and be by
                        our
                        attempts, or the meagerest results, we obliged. But when school was over, so was our wish to merely
                        satiate
                        the demands from not enough, as the demands were also from the world. Indeed, the motions of this could
                        have
                        remained as 'complient' as they were before, in that we could have taken some classes at school and
                        worked
                        part time. But, since we had none of those things, their abscence was more glaring since our grade
                        school
                        was done. More was expected of me, for we had nothing else.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, we obliged to a certain degree, feeling the heat and emptiness from doing nothing.
                        So
                        we resolved to go to school. And of our involvement we were pleased. But, the heart of the matter, was
                        that
                        we were to be dedicated to doing well, as the goal was to earn a degree. There simply was no other
                        claim.
                        And whereas getting by, 'in our compliance' in highschool felt fine, doing so in college felt mightily
                        off.
                        As it was so expensive, and the idea that our efforts were a farce had me feeling more deceptive, or at
                        least hiding what our parents would be even less accepting of. But, even more importantly, is that upon
                        this
                        great resolve, the idea that we were not doing anything but for the satiety of the moment, had me
                        feeling
                        terribly depressed. "As if all of our life, in its fine comfort and pleasantry, had been pushed to the
                        side
                        for this dutiful resolve. Yet, upon such resolve loosing any of its promsie or solidity, so were we left
                        with our formal committment to it, but no real care. And our personal comforts trickled in, acting as a
                        sort
                        of lift to our otherwise asbcence of desire or interest. And the whole thing lost its reassurance, 'in
                        that,
                        albeit compliant, we were still doing well'." And indeed, it occurred that of our cares for college, for
                        whichever reason it weighed upon me by us being merely compliant, that we felt otherwise poor in our
                        personal efforts. They were too often in use of weed and or junk; nor were we exercising as we had
                        during
                        the year prior. We were just kind old bum.
                        <br>&emsp;I had no interest in doing nothing, nor did I fool myself into thinking this was tolerable. I
                        stopped going to school, gave more quality and esteem to our personal efforts, and drifted down said
                        line.
                        At this point in my life, I had only 1 friend, though our family was in relative harmony. There was just
                        nowhere I went that introduced me to people. Nor of any potential chicks, did I care for, or feel
                        confident
                        in, achieving such matters. "And I knew no other women or girls, who, in our more real ways, saw me, and
                        I
                        them."
                        <br>&emsp;The reality of things is that work is not that fun, nor is school some given like highschool
                        was,
                        but an expensive regime; and thus not to be partaken for the mere pleasure. There is good in all of
                        this, be
                        it in the security of being on a course, or the actual means that work and a career had. But I cared for
                        it
                        not. Our roots in the years prior saw me either uninterested or averesed to it; whether by weakness or
                        laudible cynicism.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I landed then, and how this relates to our current time, is that life, in her candour
                        and
                        ways, asks that you invovle yourself with her. Be it by employment or contirbution, ought you amend. And
                        the
                        reason simply, is that your removed from other people, or any sort of regularity in your time, and thus
                        ease
                        of doing good things and not the bad. As it were, we spent much time being unoccupied, and so, of our
                        personal efforts, we militantly dedicated ourselves. But, in the year following, we leaned into the
                        occupations demanded of me, but in a way, that of those dutied strides, they were our own, and thus with
                        a
                        sort of confidence as born from integrity, and also appreication and ease, as born upon our whollness
                        and
                        strenght.
                        <br>&emsp;In this time though, we differed in that our idea of things was much more traditional than it
                        is
                        now. Our care for things was such, that of the side of things, it catered to myself. But, for instance,
                        our
                        idea of moving out, held the nomral complexion 'of what moving out required and meaned'. And as such, we
                        were tasked with working more. But I'd remark that, in our difference, or unqiueness, that we were so in
                        that, of our efforts, be it in fun or ambition, that of the goods in that which we meant to acquire, we
                        sought none. For there was nothing in my life which I wished to improve or get more of; and thus excite
                        our
                        progression in careers. Nor did I have much which gave excitment upon our employment being done. The
                        years
                        prior had fostered me little of this; nor, of the nature of such things did I really wish for more. I'm
                        talking about going out with friends, smoking, having such fun. But the whithering in our prior years
                        and
                        the according flatness upon our first college try, had me resolute in our personal affairs, akin to one
                        who
                        turns to religion and God. For me it was health and study, as to be formative, but also foundational.
                        For
                        the early efforts of these, which excited me by there lauded basis, bore so much promise and evident
                        good,
                        that I happily disposed ourselves to them. To this day, of ourselves, I marvel in the joys which our
                        propiety opens me to.
                        <br>&emsp;This notion has never been easy to exclaim. As most around me live with deeds that are more or
                        less fair and expected. Yet, in our ignorance of these things, and our otherwise attendance to
                        ourselves, so
                        our cheerful experience lay. I just have never been able to find any realtions or comfort in such a way,
                        or
                        meaning at that. All we've had is the quality of that experience, 'like one who is merely endowed with a
                        constance of rich scenery'. And what I've learned, is that such a way is not one which needs averse
                        itself
                        to others, or feel to lessened by any sparks or embers which feel contrary. "A fully incongruent flame
                        may
                        burn our forest, but a spark merely singes a spot."
                        <br>&emsp;So, we came from compliance, to even more so, but with a feeling that such was both not
                        sufficient, nor fufilling for me. The alternative though is the heart of our self, and something which I
                        cannot fully state. For in this, there lies an aversion, to care about profession or impressing girls,
                        but
                        to truly be happy. This bundled into a state of pure cynicism, where I was so happy, but overly aware of
                        others fault; in either blame, as such faults led them away from me, or in some sort of reassurance,
                        whereby
                        there weakness' highlighted our strenghts.
                        <br>&emsp;Why we were so cynical though, was that we had no friends or invovlement. Whereas now we see,
                        in
                        our easy and confident strides, that for good and moral effect, we may create, inspire, educate or
                        delight.
                        "As we see the world around me, so enamblemd by the simplest chirps and wind, so are we now calm and
                        able to
                        express this, upon another's curisoity, or our actual forthcoming." But when we were younger, we hid
                        these
                        facts. All the likely that they were obscure, and not relevant or comaprable to the normal cares. Their
                        concerns were of future oppertunity, and the cocnerns associated with that. While ours were about
                        ourselves,
                        our formation, or sensibility, our matured esteem. I felt I could not share this; and indeed, I was
                        upset
                        that I could not on the basis that none seemed to relate to me. By merrit or not, I drove others away,
                        who
                        upon getting close, showed either no interest, or were, upon a small amount share, averse to such
                        principles, I choose such ends over them. Indeed, this has create a life of solitude; which I say with
                        strenght, though admitt, naturally, and by our (perhaps all to need perfection) of such principles, that
                        loneliness was sometimes present.
                        <br>&emsp;The major development to follow, was that, in our principled way, we were happy. Inconssitnecy
                        wasn't foreign to us, and witout anythign else around, so did we feel down. But, in our discipline and
                        familiarity with such ways, we were more or less embalmed with the goods of such principle. Only, I
                        always
                        felt the wear from work, and how it would either drag my principle away, or at least make it harder to
                        pursue those; or, it would presusre me to wish for things, in glory and or gluttony, that were contrary
                        to
                        our principles. "And only sprung by our toil, rather than any good I believed in." For the first part of
                        our
                        adolescence my response to this was to overt myself from work: seemingly at all costs. "As you meet no
                        one."
                        But this became unpleasing or intolerable. And so I tried to amend. And what I found, was that as our
                        principles had settled, and the good from them was both better known and innately achieved, that the
                        reuqirments of work damned me not. We partook in such affairs with a sort of appreciation for the worth
                        (and
                        by that need) in doing them. And as such, we furthered our principles as to respect such efforts; as we
                        did
                        with our private time, in that we appropriated ourself to the nature of things as would see us flourish
                        there, that so did I include our employment in such nature. And doing so, felt as assuring and sociable
                        as
                        it had been in the years prior, but also not a drag on our dearer goods. They melded together, and we
                        were
                        in our first state of rightoues peace.
                        <br>&emsp;This is comparable to our earlier developments, when we came out into the working world with
                        flying colors. For whatever reason, our efforts in college ended by our positive resolve not to. And we
                        simply went to work, sinking into the position which that afforded; in that we were right at home, with
                        some
                        regularity, and more sociable. From here on we brought ourselves, in cheer and might. Yet, the duty of
                        work
                        never slipped me, and the only thing which would soothe it was further good surrounding it. Despite our
                        cheer, we still were not open. Not that anyone asked, but we never placed ourselves in an involving way.
                        And
                        so we still lacked many friends, nor any romance. In fact, from this time onwards, our forray into
                        romance,
                        'which is fairly esteemed as the ripest good amidst your efforts', failed time and time again. Almost
                        certaintly because of our cheer and not anything else. We were not open with people in a truly
                        meaingfull
                        way; and had we been, our romantic oppertunity may have been mute. But we were quite unaware that this
                        was
                        needed, and we thought for many years that cheerful repor was enough. "But upon our admittence of
                        yearning
                        and love, they mirrored me not." I could have been more open with people regarding games, as even in our
                        state where we did not, we still did to a degree; and over the years, our only friends were those we did
                        play games with, or smoked.
                        <br>&emsp;This better explains how we were so well, but by immature privation, or the imbalance of our
                        fair
                        reserve from unlauded things, but no otherwise offer from our higher self, made for little fun or
                        invovlement in our time outside of work and our personal time. And such a road is undoubtedly bumpy; as
                        despite haing many practices and what not to do, and an abundance of joy and activity surrounding this,
                        so
                        was it a state that had little resting comforts, or much room for error. We became a little bolted, as
                        if
                        such principles and practices were required; but doing so, at least so obstinatley, made me a little
                        stiff.
                        Indeed, when one's experience is lacking, they can paint themselves a picture, of the promise in which
                        their
                        merrits forsee ahead, or the rightouenss in what your doing, 'to warrant such experience'. But, oddly,
                        in
                        these last years, we've beckoned to such whims little, and instead, settled on the strenght of our path,
                        and
                        merely let its prominence grow. "This also gives a natural openess, to which even the meagerest of
                        things
                        around you feel more vibrant and worthwhile." Even then though, the limits of this, at least those when
                        our
                        natural pace is not so tender and pleasant, see me almost entirely pleased, but through the effortless
                        abundance in our principle. "Our life had brought us to a point where we could do all of such things:
                        yet
                        the nature of doing so only further stays: whereby your easy perfection sees you flourish alone: and
                        thus,
                        with a little inconstancy, you become less than perfect, and more aware of even the minorest slight."
                        Our
                        dedication revealled it's fairest flaw, when the grand expoundance of our cheerfull good was so remissed
                        upon being slightly less so. The value of it was not in question, but that we were expempt from all
                        things
                        other. Which, in their own fair and simple matrimony, could offer their goods while being amiable to the
                        bulk of our principle ones. "For being otherwise alone and perfect, felt unsustainable, fatiguing, nor
                        required."
                        <br>&emsp;What I found in this more or less balanced state, was that, of myself, in all its rightfull
                        and
                        pleasing way, that we still felt a far off contempt; as if it were wrong to be content with our
                        scenario.
                        The issue was not that someone stated something, or I even had a sliver of doubt, but, that of our
                        content,
                        whereby we amended to the deed of work but also in the good we got from it, that so were these strides
                        somewhat unoriented and set towards common objects of the future: a better job, a home, a family. And
                        so, in
                        being ourselves, which felt like so much and by that enough, so were we a little unerved by our content
                        in
                        being so: for it did not, outside the potential of constnat motion and lifes changing way, bring us to a
                        clear end of those esteemed objects. The irony is, that we were not aversed to these things, nor lacking
                        desire, but rather we were so kept in ourselves, that of the joys we had for so long but were so parched
                        from privation or worn from embellished work, that so was the equinimity of this so contenting, that I
                        was
                        more or less fine to let things go. For it was not entirely easy to be so pleased and unabated by work:
                        and
                        its relation to the rest of our life. But, as a gardener succeeds not in being done, but in overcoming
                        the
                        concerns of their craft, so were we equally succcssful in our balanced state: but a state which we still
                        had
                        to show up for, attend to, reflect upon. That is the difference you see, in liberty. It is not a removal
                        deeds, nor remedy, but a suprassing, as to make them truly deed like rather than a burden. Your pleased
                        to
                        do it because it is right, and happy, for the confidence in such path is one your completely embellsihed
                        towards. "It is like one who tries to walk across a balance beam, and after repeatedly falling off, or
                        stumbling across, you relish the point when you nimbly stride, without care; but not also an abasement
                        to
                        oyur practice and fidelity, which upon cultivation bears your tender stride. You forget it not, but find
                        peace in your strenght, and how easily the diffiuclty is surpassed. It is not easier, nor with less
                        risk:
                        you've merely improved. And indeed, it is a enditement to our nature and way, that we'd amend ourselves
                        to
                        such path, as if its tasks, which we were to overcome, were what we merely had to overcome: the thing
                        our
                        esteem, as born from doing well, is ordained and as such oriented to."
                        <br>&emsp;It seems enough that we'd manage our time and affairs, as to be open and well to see the sun,
                        walk
                        for the moon, bound to fields and read. And despite requiring less, there is still a great commisery
                        with
                        this in terms of youtube and shows. Music and to a greater extent games, fair similarly. It is also so
                        that
                        were with people at work, and this keeps are self-esteem in check, along with our ability to
                        communicate. It
                        is not even unlauded that you'd meet a women, or at least be sparked by one in a simple way. The time we
                        see
                        eachother may only be enough to afford a moment's pleasure, but so in our approach to work, and erotic
                        time
                        after, it is nice to have such things in our fair. "For I don't mind pleasing ourselves through natural
                        imagery; while those of a virilant and explicit sort feel like drainers to our sight of things." In many
                        ways, we have sides to us which have not been explored. And thus, our ability to share them, and not
                        otherwise feel nervous, is less accessible. And the fact that of these things, such as music or our care
                        for
                        professsions and children, so is our lack of sharing causal to us feeling somewhat aury about these
                        things.
                        "As if they are to be hidden." While sharing them once removes such sense, and becomes something that
                        you
                        don't mind being known. I feel this way about the outdoors, our care for games, televsion, literature
                        notably, and music most of all. When I see Vienna, I see someone I'd share that I used to make books.
                        This
                        is great, for your defining yourself, and making yourself, in the world your right to be in, known: thus
                        removing any burdening sense or restriction which the duty within such a place can elicit. But you
                        shouldn't
                        confuse this with your means to get more from her: as if your care to share your odd delight is some
                        sort of
                        leverage, or chance to make her interested in you. "Do you really want to be with her outside of your
                        lust
                        and, in that particular way, your care to share? If there is more, like your care for literature, or
                        even
                        something that would take more time, then feel pleased when your given the chance to offer such. But
                        don't
                        conflate this as if it is staked on some other venture. It is all too likely that your means to such is
                        not
                        limited by your abscence of gravcious offering. It might be simpler than that, or at least permitted by
                        mere
                        talking."

                        When we are breathing rightly, which is to say deep and well, we are thus able to recover and stretch,
                        and
                        from there, exercise; which then faciliates more eating and satiety, and thus energy at work, along with
                        our
                        private time.
                        <br>&emsp;For whatever reason, this line of things does not come so consistently. It's clear to see
                        where
                        were off; but not so much in the proportions of things.
                        <br>&emsp;I can't stress enough the reality of sitting on the floor. Its not at all the angle or
                        position,
                        but the hardness of the ground. I, Ryan Green, who does this so eagerly, found comfort in the softness
                        of a
                        couch. It is just hard to comparmise though, as being soft, like you are on a couch, does not make it
                        easier
                        to then sit on the floor. And doing so, be it as a means or strucutral end, faciliates much vibrance and
                        rigor into my life. Our joy of reading and writing, craft and film come's to boot. And all I'll say, is
                        that
                        the demands of our structure and metabolism are so, that of the constance which we are on the floor
                        indeulably, that so ought our amends be equal. The issue is not that we'd sit somewhere else, rather
                        that we
                        don't do the things which make the floor habitable.
                        <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this is exercise, as not doing so brings little vigor to your muscles, and
                        thus
                        gives you little means to truly recover and stretch. That, and besides the actual strenght of your
                        muscles,
                        and the brimmness which sees you more easily upright, that so in your exercise do you eat more; which
                        itself, brings a sort of energy which our work and leisure feed on. This isn't paramount, but
                        considering
                        there are things to do, and you do like food for pleasure, along with the fact that you must eat
                        somewhat,
                        that having not exercised, or at least having a muscular demand, that so does eating become more
                        fatiguing:
                        which makes you tired, and also unfit for recovery. As you tend to breathe less when you've eaten too
                        much,
                        as your body is in a sort of lethargic state.
                        <br>&emsp;Exercise is a one off though, and needs only be a consistent part of your life, not a frequent
                        one. What needs to be so frequent is yoga, whereby we wake up and rise, fold over and or lunge out,
                        along
                        with sitting upright while we twist our legs, or the mere rinse of child's pose. These motions regulate
                        you,
                        'and almost neccessarily, as any natural means to recovery and firmness could occur through according
                        movements'.

                        So there's what I'd like to do, and what, at a minimum I should focus on. As I am not particulalry well,
                        but
                        good nonetheless. Our energy is fair, though our body isn't bounding to use it. Our feels well spent and
                        with a fair amount of interest to come; but we are still uncemented in things, and by that, somewhat
                        despondant. I am not to keen for food, and am quite prepared to workout. Our coming shift will be here
                        as
                        so, and equally for all others.
                        <br>&emsp;I ought, at the very least, do our standing, some folds, a chatarange and lunge+twist, along
                        with
                        hero twists, childs pose, some bridge on all sides; and when were to solid for that, however lugging,
                        ought

                        our
                        hasbrowns fine. But maybe we'll wait till were in a better state, following decent action.
                        <br>&emsp;I would like to do pushups and or squats, but I need not rush for it. Doing your yoga along
                        with
                        running will keep our system worked alnong with holding some sort of form. As we bring ourselves through
                        those motions, we'll be better able to do more movement under load.
                        <br>&emsp;Work is fine, though it seems Vienna is young. And like her, I wish for Amon to want me,
                        though I
                        feel that were confusing want and like. As I am intrigued by many people, even if it's just how their
                        pretty. But we ought not wish for or exepct anything from them. Our actions are not likely to procurr
                        that,
                        nor warrant any confidence in something to come. In the case of Vienna, we thought she wanted something
                        from
                        me, whihc only then needed my itnerest, and so we leaned into the idea of it all happening. What I see,
                        is
                        that Amons eyes or that of anyone else, or the cheer and talking to Andy, or anyone for that matter, is
                        akin
                        to the beauty of the sun, the moon, or your care for all things literature. The difference being, that
                        people are not their to undoubtably offer you something. How relationships are formed is beyond me: but
                        I
                        don't think we dearly need one. We just need to be open, with care, and by that able to see someone; and
                        not
                        with the promise of further heat and flame. "Our life is to boldened to all the wonders and glares: and
                        I'm
                        fine with that." In fact, what I see in those rightous yet confused states, is a future where we carry
                        our
                        action. Despite your 'remedy of seeing all but holding none', so are those things still there; and not
                        likely so but in a heated state upon your heated excitment. I see, generally, and upon the tuffs of our
                        happy norm, that what we seek is to better judge, and by that, be present in the world, for either
                        education
                        or our own literal change; and my own writings are merely so as to further define what such actions
                        should
                        be. If I had to mount some purpose in mind, it would be, in company, to be more deliberate people; and
                        via
                        the landscape in which you partake and it's natural mystery, so may we better proceed. "Whereby we lean,
                        have heard, can simply expout our reason: but for action, not belief: for in that, we have none."
                        <br>&emsp;On that count, I cannot say I wish to study the clouds or light. I'm simply to ordained to our
                        health and work-life balance. But, I do wish to organize our writings so far, as to line up all the
                        philosophy, biography and joy. Governance even.
                        <br>&emsp;As for leisure, I'd merely mention the minimum, which is to look for things which attest to
                        your
                        interests. Not so you may find some, but so you may excite the one's you have. Jurassic Park for
                        instance,
                        is treating me to the production of the animatronics; and World is now a future watch. Look for these,
                        be it
                        in behind the scenese or nice analysis. This broadens your otherwise common path, in Allies and routine

                        <br>&emsp;We went in after some time off, and it was as if it weren't so. We spoke to Sam and Andy like
                        it
                        were any given day. And she did mention that she had not seen Avi for several weeks; similar to how we
                        had
                        not seen Andy: who I had a nice talk with. This shows that we are not outed from not being there so
                        much; as
                        upon being there, it's like any other day. And it was a good one. We were making smiles with Amon; we
                        learned that Vienna ---thought I'm not entirely sure about this-- is young. And I came to terms with
                        this
                        notion of like and want.
                        <br>&emsp;Schedule wise, it would be nice if we could stand by it, and let these 'out of the group'
                        apprehensions slide. Dev is quite supportive, though I don't really mean to ask if we could be only
                        given 5
                        hour shifts: I think were going to continue contriving that for us. The 8 hour wasn't poor, and perhaps
                        we'll open ourselves up to this; truly, the more time were in the department, the more precadent we'll
                        be
                        given. Right now, I care for our health and general development; and working 1 shift per week only makes
                        me
                        feel a little but unstable, as were not that occupied, and thus feel like were waiting for it; rather,
                        than
                        when there are more shifts, were anticipating it, and in a way, glad while it has not yet come, and time
                        flies this way. Moreover, our parents are fine with what were doing, and, long term, I can't say what
                        schedule will actaully give me more shifts, as my current 4 day 6-2 only gave me one. Could change from
                        week
                        to week, so I suspect opening it up to all days will do the same, and likely give you more; and by that,
                        give us some ease upon lesser shifts. I just wish for some fuller week, as we had before. Dev mentioned
                        that
                        our initial request does not count, and so right now we've got 4 more. From what I can tell, there are
                        equal
                        5 hour slots from 5 and up. The position may vary, and thus make me more likely than not to get
                        something at
                        some slot. But I see there is room for me at each, especially as time goes on. I don't even want a great
                        deal of shifts, just more than 1. Sometimes if it's more great, and thus when there is less we've
                        balanced
                        out.
                        <br>&emsp;I contend that living through the tv or your phone, reading articles and discourse as opposed
                        to
                        sources and your own writing, puts your mind into a sort of box; whereby the world becomes an arena. The
                        country of China is not how it is, in complexity and formation, but a player in the world theatre. This
                        igrores the everyday lies, and by that adminsitrations, of it's peoples. Such things being knonw, or at
                        least regarded, brings one in line with the fact that things take time, and envelop more mundanely as
                        you'd
                        expect. I don't refute by this sensibility that unwanted things or contention will occur; only, that in
                        the
                        way it does, so is it on the same line of nature as a traffic cop issuing a ticket, whereby on the
                        street,
                        via his official status, and by our orientation to the laws and penalities surroudning this, drawing our
                        amends; that so do governemnts correspond across their entirety. "Facts are facts, in an event at least;
                        but
                        judgement quickly looses anything but a glaring concavity, 'whereby the whole world seems brought to a
                        point
                        in front of you', and looses any sense of the future as relates to the past." The world is surely
                        loosing
                        it's fortitude when it comes to energy usage, nor is conflict invincibly absent, nor the economy in a
                        constantly flourishing state. But the bones of the world do not change, nor effects everyone equally.
                        And
                        so, by this complex procession, things move on, and we are either privy to hurt, upset about others,
                        still
                        appreciative of all that remains, and, for me, indeluably fine in as much as our natural liberty is
                        concerned: for we may always subject ourselves to law and blade.
                        <br>&emsp;as such, this world will go one, moving to and fro, showing weakness and or glare along many
                        of
                        it's sides. The whole could wain, in truth, or be destroyed; but those judgements seem more like shanty
                        predictions instead of a reality. "In the same way that world has remained very similar, despite the
                        gleam
                        of conteomporary fashions, that so is it clear to me that it will contine in such a fundemnetal way." I
                        understand that in rhetoric and fear, things may occur, however near to us, or prevalent to tohers
                        around.
                        But I stand, by our own interests and occupation, to the remnance of something, and therefore position
                        for
                        me to afford improvement. For that, I see the things I care for, the manner in which I'd share, the
                        potential means and or forms in which such would be conducted; and also, the freedom and ease for this
                        to be
                        made and goverend by our liberty, as opposed to fear of not reaching expansion, or achieving esteem.
                        This is
                        simply my line through the future days of the world: and I am fairly content to tailor the roots, trim
                        the
                        leaves, and relish the joy in which we treat such: while our mountain of pure happiness is more or less
                        un-caught by the murky impressions, nor distraught by any of it's distasetfull reality. I dont recognize
                        though, that, of our judgements, in all senses of morality, and also by through our maturity, that
                        things
                        being so espeically well for me, in circumstances beyond our unburdened liberty, 'where we are not only
                        stronger, but amidst things being well', that the extent to which we are fair and natural to enjoy that,
                        or
                        be pleased at least and accordingly bade, so the root of judgement lay. "For what ought one do when
                        death is
                        no bane, nor sickness and a dipped economoy? What if there is plenty around, in vibrant simplicity and
                        oppertunity? Are such occupations and or delights, in their positive regards, fair to dissolve any
                        despair
                        of those suffering around?"

                        So I see much value in relgion, as early on it can earn you culture, either directly, or for cities with
                        wonders ---you get less there on mass, but also get science and gold. The main thing though, is once a
                        city
                        is converted, which occurs instantly if it has no relgion already, so can't it be removed until the
                        theology
                        tree is completed. This may be not so, but to a degree, there is some initial permanence to your own;
                        waivering though in the benefits you get, while being easy to remake. By that, when there is little
                        infastrucutre to build early on, build missionaries, as they can turn your own cities in preperation for
                        rationalism, and then convert other settlements, and maintain them. You can also get relics, extra
                        defense
                        or movement.
                        <br>&emsp;City states are better overall, offering bonuses to rural tiles, or hard boost of a certain
                        yield per the total city states you have. If you have a science, cultural and economic, you
                        get 3x5
                        per each yield. Military adds combat similarly, +1 per. This is really solid. With Greece, you get the
                        tradition
                        that reduces the cost of this venture, along with the 2 point in diplomacy, which adds it's own
                        reduction. Like many
                        things, certain events trigger skill points, and so, starting with a diplo point is one thing, but you
                        may then get a
                        another from an event; or simply build the Ginseng Wonder. Also, the military states offer the hillfort,
                        which, like
                        other states, are only good if you a) have rural tiles that make use of it, and b) you are not going to
                        build over these
                        with buildings. As it were, production does not stay useful, as you run out of things to make, and so
                        having the hard
                        culture, gold and science yields remain important. Combat wise, your almost certaintly defending, and so
                        the
                        inconsistency in which you'd use a the miliatry bonus is small. I say this, for early on, you may
                        benefit from killing
                        these to level up your generals, and then convert the hard yield ones.
                        <br>&emsp;Speaking of defense, it seems that the key point is in what is worth protecting during a
                        defense. Enemy
                        pillaging isn't to concerning, but rather, that we'd hold onto fortified points, while also having room
                        to concentrate
                        fire. Channeling enemies in works well then. And you need not fret so long as you have walls; even if
                        some get broken,
                        others remain a neccessary target. This works with the notion that layering your civilization is
                        important, as you can
                        support the front lines better, and remove the angles in which your attacked. In many ways, hard yields
                        are what your
                        striving for, while growth yields are for short term benefit. You ought balance out the interest for
                        certain resources
                        half way across the map, with the more secure position near your other settlements. You also wont
                        trigger the enemies
                        aggression, allowing for trade, less need for military. "You'll get the resources then."
                        <br>&emsp;It is worth noting that culture buildings get + yeilds per city state throughout each age,
                        while science does
                        so in antiquity, but then gives 5 One important element is in settling. As far as I know, you get 8
                        settlement limit at
                        the start of
                        exploration, regardless of how little or much you had in antiquity. If you have 5 settlements, and see
                        no solid expands,
                        then you may invest in those cities as to prepare them for exploration, and leave your settlement cap
                        for exploration.
                        You'll get +1 at feudalism, likely a +1 in your unqiue civ tree, and then get +2 in the mid tree, and +3
                        at the end.
                        Plus, you can naturally go 1 over, and likely 2 if your happiness is fine. From this, it is clear that
                        there are moments
                        to expand and moments to wait. The early exploration rush is one where you grab treasure resources and
                        rich pieces of
                        land. While, the latter age, upon offering many settlements, is when you prioritize resources for the
                        modern age, or
                        strategic placement; and this can be so in the far continent, or the little islands through the sea. In
                        our Spain game
                        for instance, there's a city state blocking the Red Woods, and we may choose to go over there later,
                        destroy it and
                        settle the wonder. This will require some military, and thus is not something able to be rushed. Nor
                        ought we care, as
                        we can go elsehwere with our linited settles. It's important to scout; which gives spain an edge as the
                        conquistador can
                        reveal the whole map. But otherwise, it's important to find other civ's capitals and lands, and
                        otherwise see islands
                        floating about. You'll meet city states this way, grab discoveries, and otherwise see viable spots for
                        the later age
                        settles.
                        <br>&emsp;In antiquity, as you naturally have less settles or room, and are generally fine to have tight
                        civ, you may
                        invest in exploration yields, but building great amphitheatres and academies, and going for culture and
                        science golden
                        ages. Skill points wise, you can only get 2, and so, the yield cards for each costing 2 means you can
                        still get an extra
                        point. Otherwise, you end up wasting a legacy point, as there's nothing to spend it on. Each building
                        will give 2 yield,
                        totalling 10 each per 5 cities. If you have 2 resources, plus the 4 base yield, that's 6 total as
                        compared to 2. This
                        extra 20 culture and science will be quite noticable in the early exploration. Amphitheates gives +1 per
                        adj. mountain,
                        natural or world wonder. This feels like a way in which our mid game stability can apply itself, in that
                        we can see
                        where potential wonders go ---as we at a minimum need 7--- then plot where ampitheaters and academies
                        will go. Since
                        ampitheateres come at engineering, they can be built first, boosting your ability to get culture. For
                        the sake of
                        Colossus and monks mound, you may benefit strictly, and otherwise get wildcard civic. I am not seeing a
                        huge amount of
                        interest racing for Colosseum or Theodric civic, as the settlement limit is boosted equally regardless,
                        and you may not
                        have worthwhile settlements on the homeland. A weak settlement then may be worth less a exploration
                        island full of
                        resources. Acadmeis come the tech after, at mathematics, and are less hastily needed. The ampitheatres
                        progress the
                        civic tree for the sake of wonders, while the science tree has nothing but codices to unlock: there's no
                        race for those

                        So the early game has it's own motions, while the mid game allows time for things to develop. The end
                        game
                        specifically allows for ampitheatres and academies to be built. Generally, the codices are accesible,
                        while
                        making wonders can be quite competative. It seems that Oracle and Colosseum last a while, while
                        Terracota,
                        Theodric and Nalanda go quick; as does Weiyang and Sanchi Stupa.
                        <br>&emsp;My feeling is that as you establish your settlements, and you have the culture and science
                        buildings possible, that making wonders is important; as getting the legacy points is a game changer for
                        exploration. Economics is always easy; though, like most things, you may rush the age.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, your going to get the yields you do, and it is worth valuing the security of a
                        wonder
                        rather than getting a potential +1 adjacency elsewhere.
                        <br>&emsp;Considering you need 7, gate of all nations and Dur-Sharrukin seem accesible, followed by
                        Weiyang.
                        Sometimes the Ai's production out beats you, so relying on Oracle and Colosseum is swell, along with
                        Angkor
                        Watt --which seems very uncompetative. Emile Belle is one you can race for; and indeed, get the yields
                        you
                        can, but don't hold off while something is avaivalble. It is better to secure it when you have the free
                        time, even if your not getting another +1 elsewhere. Don't rush Emile in your capital if you have other
                        things to do: but considering the wonder race and the value of succeeding, we ought not loose by trying
                        to
                        get 15

                        Some of this may be off, but in general, muscles are more sensitive to sugar, and perhaps insulin by
                        that
                        measure, as an effect from exercise. But it is load-bearing, or intense exercise which does this.
                        Aerobics
                        make you more sensitive to air intake and thus oxygen. This is why, when our body is not able to take in
                        as
                        much sugar, we either wish to work out, or, following an aerobic session, we wish for sugar. As I should
                        say, the less sensative means the more simple sugar is required: while being more sensative means you
                        can
                        intake heartier sugars. By that, if we are simply aerobic, and thus full of oxygen, but only with means
                        for
                        taking in sugar, then we will still want that sugar since we have oxygen: where we'd be groggy
                        otherwise; or
                        starving, as our less than promisiung means for sugar --from having too little oxygen-- bade me to eat
                        nothing at all.

                        It is so easy to be free and happy. In principle, one can harness the remission from problems, by making
                        themselves more austere, and by that stronger; as well as using their sensibilities to see either a) the
                        worth in the deed, or b) how they can orient themselves, via fortitude or position, to make the weight
                        feel
                        less. Time and fortune may lower the mass of the weight: but we are never short of means to incorporate
                        its
                        press, and by all accounts, bear the burden.
                        <br>&emsp;For happiness, you may use your privalage, or conjure some at least, to either a) acquire
                        things
                        of a nice sort, or b) marble the grief of your deeds, by pleasant remedies, or passion --of an immediate
                        or
                        longed for sort. "This route does not necceasrily remove one's deeds; nor does it emphasize the better

                        and fatigure remain. Plus, in our prior approach, our composure tends to remove us from the pithy
                        irratibilities and strife of the world. While ignoring ourselves for hope and ambition can see us
                        subject to
                        those squiblings."

                        sense,
                        so is this merely about us; our time, our experience, our fair and or vicious activity. But so the world
                        lies, whereby some folk are not so privalaged, or are burdened with chains of a less natural sort.
                        Circumstance even may see pestulance swothing the land, or a community at least. "And like one in a
                        herd,
                        who runs when a predator is in sight, I can't help but feel my flight is no longer of concern, and that

                        An applied life is one that, surprisingly, is not one of occupation. For in that, your head is done; and
                        albeit resolved, so are you not moving based on deliberation, but rather some oblige. Despite seeming
                        like a
                        deliberation, ambition is really not so: as one who is not obliged, lives without burden, and by that,
                        amends to things via their freedom, rather than for it.
                        <br>&emsp;Perhaps the right way of seeing this is along the lines of progress. For indeed, we resolve
                        ourselves to go to school, have families, achieve things. But these things are temporary, 'like one
                        reaching
                        for the mountain top'. But our life, amidst the constant development of nature and mankind, is
                        commiserably
                        flowing: and thus, each top is but the beginning of the next. And the resolve to reach a point is not
                        the
                        same is being resolute in being: for in one, and end is reached, while the other, is never done.
                        <br>&emsp;By this token, I can admitt that our efforts are driven by this 'progresive notion'; and that
                        we
                        do not in fact have an aim. What I've noticed, is that the misfortune of other people becomes apparent
                        to me
                        when we are not so resolve: as if we are free enoguh to be, but by that, not so comfortably when, in
                        such
                        openesses, we overlook others in need. But around this then lies resolves of the sort, where we seek to
                        aid
                        others. Only, this seems like it's own form of being, in that, by which end or not, I will simply try.

                        recycling, deliberation regarding politics, liking videos and all things of the sort, so are we active,

                        a such, a person who exhibits such via their constitution. It is not so much that we have an end in
                        mind,
                        but a resolve of being. That we'd wish for some point to be reached is but a ideal call, as to encourage
                        and
                        or convince us in the reason and worth of such being."

                        in
                        preservation there may be conflict; or some may not even have a home, or rights.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, it is clear, and well executed by individuals, when their against involving others

                        intervene? Formally, this may merely be a moral question. But practically, what ought we really do? For
                        if
                        someone is crying in the streets, you help them. No one walking by, if they were not clearly being

                        would ignore the motion. "They would at the very least cower in shame."

                        but
                        a report, or some sort of distributed motion --such as a transmission, or letter. Most have no means to
                        aid
                        such pleas. But they are also not the one's recieving; but likely those who are civilly arranged to heed
                        such matters, and from there respond. "There is much discourse around this though on our local grounds.

                        This sentiment could be absolute, in it's nature at least. But I will use it as a prime example an
                        approach
                        which reflects a subject, and maintains the value of the subject, all the while the approach makes it
                        not
                        absolute.
                        <br>&emsp;That is the notion of semantics; phrases, terminology, form. This is how we establish the
                        objects
                        of our reasoning, the material of thought. Physcologly and neurology are not so advanced as particle
                        physics, but if we overlook the basis for us thinking at all, then we can say distinctly, that semantics
                        differs from reality, in that of one, you are merely finding the ingrediants, considering how you'll mix
                        them; while reality --as to somewhat include thinking-- holds such mixing and combining, and all
                        consquent
                        actions born about. Additionally, when it comes to the world in which we derive our concepts, so may we
                        mention this as mere reflection; whereby the worlds elements strike us, and by the impression dealt, so
                        do
                        we regard and define: whereupon we ask, resolve and proceed.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the ideas along these lines is the sentiment of taste; whereby our semantics may not
                        espouse right and wrong, good and bad, while our natures, as struck and drawn by nature, or reality
                        rather,
                        bear us to proceed in according ways: the ends of which we approve of, as if by some scale for good, by
                        their taste.
                        <br>&emsp;I mean to explore this notion of semantics, as describing it as 'some formation of words and
                        jargon' is not something which seems entirely fair. But I do see it, usefully at least, as a contrast to
                        what is otherwise real, and by that as it pertains to the good, apparent.
                        <br>&emsp;For the issue in life is whether our ends be goverened by natural reason, or the esteem of
                        semantics. Again, I don't wish to put the latter in a box, 'as if Aristotle and Aquinas were making but
                        worded arguments'. But I do see that there is a basis for these sentiments in which the worth of them is
                        via
                        some sort of necessity. "As if, by pure reasoning, rather than by what we observe, that it can be shown
                        how
                        things must be a certain way." The key issue then with semantics is their source for terms, as any
                        principled notion of being is quite hard to approve when the material in which it molds it's arguments
                        come's from something real. And the limit of real things is that they cannot be explained naturally, or
                        at
                        least by something which we could in theory observe. The idea of neccessity, as if a crutch to the
                        inability
                        for reality to be such a way, but of a principle sort instead, lies warrantedly upon our faith in
                        principle,
                        and not natural reason; but also, to any accredited degree, of the form in which neccessity takes, 'as
                        pure
                        reason is not espused the same by all, and thus holds it's own scale for proper decree', that so much as
                        such espousals are deemed fair by virtue of natural reason being unlauded, then so must such principle
                        cames
                        derive themeselves from material outside what natural reason offers. "For such semantic claims are only
                        valid so much as such reason is not: and so the former pulling from the latter insubstantiates itself."
                        <br>&emsp;In other words, claims regarding the world faulter on their limited identity. "As the form,
                        basis
                        and cause for something ought be inherent to it in the way we speak of it; for of that dog over there,
                        in
                        regarding it I am pointing to it as 'that dog'; but as a thing, as 'that dog', so is it a thing in
                        entirety,
                        and thus of all the properties within it's identity." The limit of this is the basis for neccessity, or
                        principle rather; as something not being in and of itself, but rather imposed upon, 'by a principle
                        hwich is
                        not, in a fair sense, real', is what the natural limit implores.
                        <br>&emsp;But in all of this, we have what I'd esteem as a sort of inquiry. For the lack of true
                        identity is
                        in all practicality a state of our awareness, and not something which we know is unaccessible. There
                        are, to
                        be fair, claims regarding principle, that, of their being principle, so is this required innately; and
                        not
                        souly as an alternate to our natural limits. And by that, even if there is realistically more we could
                        identify about something, so is plausible that the floor (so to speak) is truly 'unreal'; and that we
                        don't
                        merely have faith in this, but know. You could also say the same thing equally about reality, in that it
                        must be real, and makes little sense being dual, or not completely immenent (but also imposed). My ears
                        are
                        open to the inquiries regarding principle and any of their sure claims, but surrounding these semantics,
                        or
                        ideas rather, there sits a sort of natural clutch; in which the value of a complete reality is
                        positivley
                        further known; and more, that any plausibility in this not being so, or at least there being somethinbg
                        else, is entirely confused; in that, of anything bit and piece used in principle's claim, 'that those
                        elements must themselves be ecistent, or imminent rather, or otherwise be in need of their own
                        imposition'.
                        The cause of God is a common example of this notion. Again, I admitt that their may be angles to this
                        which
                        don't reduce 'this other world' to it's ostensively real world, 'adjacent to our own, and equally of
                        foreign
                        need'. But I do say, that of that possible inquiry, that we merely state that it is semantics which best
                        explains this line of procession, whereby the potential for principle is there, as we believe or think
                        neccessary, but otherwise is squished out of the buldging extent of our espousals of reality, and the
                        otherwise weakness in the idea of there being anything else: for which our faith in reality is formed.
                        "Pure
                        reason reflects the fair espousal of the need of principle; be it in what natural reasoning lakcs, or
                        what
                        is altogether enhirently warranted by it. Semantics lacks this credible expression, and instead sits in
                        orbit outside the lands of natural reason: while pure reason exists as it's own centre. Funnily enough,
                        the
                        weakest products of such reason are the debirs of suprersition, where the results which such reasoning
                        espouse are deemed confirmed by such 'gossiped events'. But that is just a sly remark of mine. Deep
                        reason
                        may live it's day, as we natural reckoners do: we are all inquirers."

                        When I have enough to do, my time is tempered by occupation; and thus I see not but fashions itself
                        around
                        this. When I am not so obliged, I see around, feeling a little unkept at our emptiness; and by that,
                        lack of
                        attention to those who are struggling. But while were occupied, I naturally respond with, 'to those, I
                        cannot: I have something else to do'. I don't think it an unimportant point that I'd amend myself for
                        the
                        sake of other's; and for the sufficiency which my current occupations are staked on, so could I earn the
                        same through more helpful ways. But in this deliberate address, 'where I holster myself towards the care
                        of
                        others', I sit on a path which is wholly my own. Only, if such path is burned with fortune and
                        indolence,
                        then we feel less grounded in it being about me: for it is our center, but nothing to it. While having
                        something to do, dissolves any worry or contempt, 'at being so self-centred, yet hollow'; as we are
                        either
                        a) elsewhere obliged, and unoticed of anything but, or b) relaxed into the notion, that of anything else
                        I
                        cannot, for of my current stead, I must show up. I may make the choice to go elsewhere, but as much as I
                        am
                        employed for our own purpose, so is our committment attached to that. "Making it so, of other things, I
                        can't."
                        <br>&emsp;I don't have grand aims though, in terms of what our own life would seem like. If we
                        realistically
                        have reason and permission to abide our own time, so am I still uninterested in being so indeluably
                        occupied. I still wish for a life with few problems, merely the ebbs of employment. I like to be
                        invovled
                        with such thing, for the exercise, the itinerary, seeing others, be it strangers or collegues. This is a
                        track which is both sufficient and nourishing. As steady as this line is, I am annointed to it through
                        time's channel. Upon our work being done, we merely wander, see and alight to the lands and scene
                        around:
                        only to dip our toes back in the pool of employment. This is our path, our process; and it is only when
                        it's
                        rythm is flat, as our life has at some points been, that we yearn for something more. As we may still be
                        active and great but without amends; and thus drawn, by our free time, to show all how to live so great.
                        Ultimatley, these states are generally due to vagrancy, rather than stable flourishing. You may be given
                        much, but it is not unbridled, or a real means for happiness. There may be something to it, as our
                        generous
                        oblige does have free time. But I think overall, there is air beneath this claim, and does not reflect
                        what
                        is required or effective. I much prefer our line of employment, in it's simplicity, and the cares and
                        amends
                        which sprout from that. If we are so privalaged, let us not sink into it, but use it as a soft means to
                        embellish our employment; and maintain that proper pace, 'in style and grace', but in a way that the
                        privalge nicely offers. "Without fortune, we may simply be, but in an arrangment that asks a bit more
                        from
                        us. While being so free, ought make room for nearer liberty: where we live happily, but rightfully: and
                        it
                        is our privalge which allows this to happen so calm and lightly."

                        aid; some sort of anwser, a promise. "By showing our light." Yet, I am not sure what we ever thought the

                        espoue myself to be. I could be deliberate, and contribte towards assigning those who will actuall
                        organize
                        and paraly the motions of the world. But so will they do that. "Short and simple, the offering to those
                        who
                        would also usher in such conductions is what the parlance of my judgement is based on. " Yet, I have no
                        real
                        plans to say this, nor nothing which is so rightfully worthwhile.

                        One of the reasons we don't dream of rich delights, is when we have to get what we need, this is

                        enough. We need corn, edamame, tuna; and thank gosh we have barley, lentils and quinoa. What about soup?

                        I have a strong sense of man's past. From cells to primates, Through Greece and Rome, France and
                        Industry.
                        Nor is my grip on humanity lacking, as I read memoirs from soldiers, medics, ministers and such;
                        equally,
                        our philosophy, or character, is as solid, as we read Plutarch, Seneca and Montainge. Nor do I lack my
                        own
                        reflection, as drawn from that. "So far, of myself, the point of our actions, the ease in our way, so
                        have
                        our words neared a million."
                        <br>&emsp;I say this, for when I hear of the world, be it in passing, or from a strict source, I am
                        always
                        impressed with a view that accounts for too little; or says as much. That, and of what is said, so are
                        the
                        strides of it all, close and far, not as it may seem. The way in which you take in such information
                        moulds
                        what you take in, and thus what you see. But the point, is that, be it hasty predictions and or
                        judgement,
                        or the mere acceptence of the scene at hand, that so is there more: not only in what is being impressed,
                        but
                        also what your own thinking would deem. For even the mightiest of claims, full of truth and depth, holds
                        no
                        meaning for us unless we reflect, determine and amend.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, any person or place wihch is in distress, is of the responsability to those closer to
                        it;
                        when comparing my need to oblige. My place, when it come's to things far and away, is in the positive
                        strides I make; where our light of reason forms itself into it's own impressionable fashion, and through
                        the
                        literary medium, strikes those foreign. This is but influence though, as if some spreading of truth: for
                        fire's to no longer be made. As for those at home, so man has strenght and adaptibility. Nor is everyone
                        effected like another: in magnitude or actual effects. "Some have something removed, but still hold
                        alot,
                        while other's experience a relatively higher loss: while some loose much less. And of those who loose
                        much,
                        so doth our pithy cares and fears melt away, and be it the most grievous despair, or one of economic
                        plight,
                        so our strength and endurance lay. Pain lies otherwise, as something worth avoiding, but complete in
                        itself,
                        and experienced accordingly: which is a point most challenging to contend."

                        Let us, for once, not dwell on our current state, and rather let life pass us by. We are often so wowned
                        up,
                        that we speak of things from such a bound state. "As if our sight was condensed, and thus, of the
                        flickering
                        images we say, we tried to define. Weirdly though, there is this thing, where in our hazy view, we reach
                        for
                        clarity even more: which is natural perhaps, as the simple wish to see is common, and so as much as it
                        is
                        gone, so further effort lay."
                        <br>&emsp;I see that education is merely a distribution of past experience. A curriculum is a sort of
                        curration of this, as to say, which parts of the domain we divulge, and the elements within those. For
                        me,
                        like most, I have a unique curriculum. As I have read books, seens shows, reflected here and there in a
                        way
                        that is original to me: as other's equally experience. And I see us offering such through the time
                        ahead.
                        <br>&emsp;But I am restless, thrown off by international contention; and this isn't helped by the
                        scandalous
                        impression we recieve; and, equally, the abscence of reflection and incorporation that the presentation
                        of
                        such things provides.
                        <br>&emsp;Our view of the world has come out of idle defintiion. Looking for more, wishing to feel fine.
                        But
                        in that, we've grown a tight hold of such things. Yet, there is still not much but this, and so when
                        were
                        impressed by others, or even with suspense of sharing who we are, we have nothing but our 'literary
                        memory'.
                        <br>&emsp;Ironically, our care to study comes from our wish to fortify ourselves against the suggestions
                        around me. First, we sought to explore the meaning of wellness, as to be positive in our dismissal of
                        our
                        parents pleas. But during that, as we accordingly lived, we sought to learn of the world; as seeing how
                        it
                        is reguarly, and in it's breadth is relatively mundane and common, gave me a sort of righteous peace.
                        "As if
                        time would go on, and by our fair actions, treat us." But this is not to hard to describe as our
                        'private
                        pace' being secured by worldly sense: as to remove envy, hatred and yearning.
                        <br>&emsp;This spot speaks greatly, as we have never lived in a way, that was truly ours, but without
                        the
                        brace this requires. For we are without friends, romance, comfort or acclaim. Even in our applied
                        moments,
                        so were these concessions to such lackings, 'as if they were truly needed, and in response, we occupied
                        ourselves in a way fitting to me: yet such ways were a mark of you lacking'.
                        <br>&emsp;Perhaps it's the form of our day, in that were part of an economy, housed in property, and
                        thus
                        foreign to those next door; nor so familiar or attached to those you see during work --and sometimes at
                        best, often. I recall as a kid that we'd see the same people every day at school. But as we've grown
                        older,
                        there is not but who you see at work. There is much interest, and you may through leisure and what not
                        connect. But of actual people, who give weight and support to your mind, there is little.
                        <br>&emsp;Ulotimately, I am thrown off by the world around, when it is suggested, and through a form
                        which
                        does so hotly, but we are not at all present. I don't participate, actively at least, in such forms,
                        because
                        they are so hard to be present with. But I see, even in our passing, that we'd normally be fine

                        So, beneath our moving state, lies someone who is neither content nor secure. I see how shaky we are
                        upon
                        political discourse; or when someone thinks our views are confusing, or wrong.
                        <br>&emsp;We are not so absent though, and perhaps, be it out of fatigue or reason'd argument, we sink
                        too
                        much into those baser holes: which tends to make us strain on the other uplifting points.
                        <br>&emsp;We are simply without problems, nor fun though. And because of this, we feel ourselves
                        teatering
                        towards poor choices. Yet, we are not so naturally alive in our active state. And so, without occupying
                        ourselves eslewhere, or, by virute of that, our lack of general occupation per our broader choices, that
                        so
                        do we feel that slumping, or at least suggestive plea, whereby we sink into what matters to us, 'yet
                        thereby
                        remove ourselves from the world'. Were not there, merely with sight: as one does when there in middle
                        earth,
                        while reaing LOTR.
                        <br>&emsp;This is the problem you see; that you cannot pang yourself to lift up above 'your emotions or
                        colored responsed'; nor are we accepting of that which would remedy us in our otherwise personal place.
                        "For
                        this holds no fun, nor the cares from occupation."

                        I sit here as one, whose made an oringal choice, to beckon themselves to the simple side of life, in all
                        her
                        ease and glory. Only there's this shame in doing so, as you feel, in some sense fairly, though also with
                        privalage, that other's are in worse affairs then you are. Indeed, in my younger years, I felt cynical
                        about
                        this, exclaiming that it was there choices which brought them there. And I don't think this false, but
                        also
                        a bit to self-centered of me, 'as if it is my right, or even a full-fledged claim, to say that there
                        struggles are not to do with circumstance, but themselves'. I think these sentiments are important, just
                        as
                        remarking on our goals and their progress is something good for anyone in any pursuit. But we ought be
                        more
                        senisible to those who are already in motion.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I've sat for some time is in this state, where the impressions I had of the world were
                        such,
                        that of their quality I cared for dear. Yet the idea that I'd watch something, or bear some idea of
                        something, and feel it so important to arrange myself as to see these better, or with a serious mind,
                        only
                        reflects our peculiar state. In many ways, it come's from this managed state of freedom, whereby all the
                        burdens and deeds in the world are removed for the benefit of peace and activity. Yet, we somewhat cower
                        to
                        this very motion, 'as upon our relaxtion, or pause of such motions, which are in themselves very good,
                        we
                        don't anticipate returning, nor being stout to their means'.
                        <br>&emsp;In effect, we've helmed the form of our ideas, as for some reason, this gave reason and
                        purpose to
                        such line. But the result is an all to wearying affair. For no one really cares, nor am I that worthy in
                        our
                        espousals. The world is not some cohesive bunch, 'but like the summer, everyone is dealing with the
                        heat'.
                        <br>&emsp;I find that much of our confidence come's from our approach; that it was fair, sensible and
                        rewarding. And indeed, this ought bring acclaim and afford an impact; yet, in this light we have, we
                        don't
                        bring it; but rather wish to shine, so other's may see and heed us. This is an odd notion, for our inner
                        self wishes to contribute, or at least have our wisdom heard. Yet we don't wish to speak.
                        <br>&emsp;I think that, had we been with different strides, then we wouldn't feel so endebted to this
                        complex approach; and by that, so defensive of anything which bore suggestions from some point else. I
                        think
                        the root of these need is by our momentum, and how despite relishing our joy and motion, that so don't
                        we
                        care for this in any great or meaningfull way. For is it really that special? Ought we be heralded? And
                        of
                        the moral which this story of our's has forbode, is it a way that is exclsuive? For if it is, then your
                        begrudgement is understandible, or at least clear in the sacrifice: for I may give up friends for joy.
                        But
                        is such a request in place? We've learned not. Only, of our motions, born towards said friends, or by
                        our
                        joyous stride, so are we unsure how to do so. And it is not an unimportant point that our choices thus
                        far,
                        as born from the varied states of those joyous (yet as such reserved) motions, is one, where of those
                        friends, we are in company not; nor, of things meaningfull, are we with much constance of place, to feel
                        like we can broadly proceed. "For we too often see an end in sight; and thus collect ourselves as to
                        approach it peacefully: while our ambition is dead."
                        <br>&emsp;For so long, we've been learning of the world as to justify, or be able, in being skeptical.
                        That
                        no matter the results, so were they not as you beleived; and thus could be handled. "The world always
                        sheds
                        her flame." Again, we brace ourselves, or at least affirm the breadth of the world, and how any cause
                        for
                        concern, criticism or bleak view is ill founded: in that it applies to smaller view. But this push of
                        ours
                        comes from us being somewhat endowed to the world beyond me. "As if to justify our reserved state, yet
                        supposed blossoming: that things will be fine till we reach that." It seems clear now, that we ought
                        sink
                        back into ourselves, and view the world, by fear and oppertunity, or interest at least, as it pertains
                        to
                        me, and not be so far removed, yet strictly in the grasp of all people and such.
                        <br>&emsp;In many ways, our pleas, or inquiries rather, come because of something we don't know. And for
                        whichever reason, we hate predictions that come at other people's expense: so I wish to doubt these. But
                        it
                        is because of things i don't know that I cannot rest so easily, and let things happen. "Perhaps were too
                        tucked away in the corner, that we feel, in our un-solid fears, that if something bad was to come to
                        pass,
                        that we'd be fine. But akin to the economy, so would most be out there in the firestorm: and so, I
                        beckon to
                        my sense, and at the very least, heed the response of my conclusion as being false, so much as
                        somethhing
                        seemingly required for the result of it to seem meaningfull, 'in that I knew the domain predicted to be
                        effected', that so was any view of such domain, in lacking certain things, false, and thus any fear
                        evoked
                        was ungrouned. Nor, did what we think, in the broad scale of things, feel so gloomy. Yet, we only
                        imagined,
                        had the domain been with the properties which I suspected, then the sense of the impact (of some
                        esteemed
                        cause), be of different scales and propoertion as I otherwise was provoked, or in reaction."
                        <br>&emsp;I think, that there are many things to do, or learn rather. And these may be for the reasons
                        that,
                        of our views, ought they not be full of harsh sympathy. Indeed we may actually care for those impacted,
                        whilst retaining some structure at broader scales. But we may also not actually care so much for what
                        goes
                        on.
                        <br>&emsp;I do not wish to dwell, but this sense, where things are not so bad as they seem, is one
                        where, of
                        a thing's impact, ought it not speak for the rest. And so, if we may accept that all are recieving
                        economic
                        weight, that to presume anything else is folly. "For I hate thinking that everyone is in plight." And I
                        know, or am at least somewhat even-headed, when it comes to the actual dire effects upon people. For
                        whatever reason, we see, that this idea that there is more struggle than I really belive, at least in
                        proportion, 'as an event in one town does not indicate or speak for the next'. The reality, is there may
                        be
                        somethimg, even across broad lines. But because our sense is not to ignore, we feel like our weight in
                        doing
                        so, 'while not overstating things' is to hollow. "We are pointed towards sensibility, but without any
                        postive force: we merely have the privalge and broad sense, to reserve ourselves from judgement. Yet, as
                        we
                        know less about certain things, so can we reserve no longer, and must try to do something, or bear down,
                        and
                        resist the view which says there bad in all."
                        <br>&emsp;Ought we care? Well no, there is no need. But you may care, and apply yourselfs: as if it were
                        something your drawn and pleased to do. I am not sure even, for we are ultimately in our own personal
                        place.
                        Most who deem the world such, fairly or not, forget this: including I. I think, perhaps, if we learned
                        more
                        about the world, 'as not to merely have the sense, had we learned, that we would be right', that we
                        might
                        actually be more lauded, and by that, care less to affirm were right. For seeing the whole world, you
                        can
                        appreciate the economic turmoil of our time, and even cultural discontent; all the while, seeing how
                        many
                        are effected by malaria and aids, your affirming the bad which you might otherwise ignore. Indeed, these
                        things are not absent from our side of the world: but at least were recognizing, outside our issues with
                        employment and linving, 'the friction of our fortunes', that so may we actually rest easy on the more
                        petulent bad.

                        Our relationship to things is two fold. One, is that we may know little of what's going on, but rest on
                        our
                        memory of the past; that, of whatever does come, so will it effect that which has been; and thus, our
                        view
                        of such impact may be reigned in, based on what it does or does not change. "For in many ways, walking
                        down
                        the street, engaging in leisure at home, nothing could cause you to notice this change."
                        <br>&emsp;On the other hand is judgement; or at least the exclaiming of things based on what you know.
                        This
                        is weird, for even in the simplest matters we don't know. "As we are not so embalmed with current
                        events."
                        But in this, we have tended to rest on a wide structure of the world, 'whereby, less we were
                        deliberatley
                        with care of all, that of the whole, nothing caused a change'. And we were thrown off when people
                        thought
                        otherwise. And, as we've overlooked certain things, we are still without that full judgement,'whereby we
                        can
                        attest to something small, as we have some firmness to the whole'. What occured, is that our broad view,
                        'as
                        if a permitt to be indifferent', acted as a sort of judgement itself. "Whereby we were against anything
                        be
                        deemed to happen at all." As a result, we tried to further dilute our worldy sense, 'as to be so far off
                        from anything which did happen, that it's impact could not be heard: as if some loud boom a mile away
                        was
                        pushed 100 further."
                        <br>&emsp;And I can't quite say what this means. As I ultiamtely don't wish for their to be any booms;
                        but
                        my reservation is on the whole, 'as if there are not so many'. But this is about me not needing such
                        booms
                        to be there. "As if, the world were in fact so spread afar, that the appearence of things, 'outside our
                        foreign gaze' was small, and thus it seemed like little was happening. There certaintly is, but via our
                        occupation, 'there was little to spurr me', and thus, by our own strides, we could focus on and
                        proceed."
                        <br>&emsp;The point though, is that even if all the booms in the world feel outside your door, that you
                        are
                        not so responsible to be so withdrawn in your judgement. I understand the nature of these impressions
                        and
                        how much they overload you, 'but there being things going on around the world', does not mean that you
                        should be impacted, 'as if by our people experiencing trouble'. Our normal response is one where we feel
                        little going on. We care for this, because it calls for little judgement; as we need no forwardness if
                        their
                        is nothing pressed upon us.

                        I forget that people are running their own buisness. A house is literally an equity. If you let it go to
                        ruin, it looses value, and as such is a worse asset. Very little in the world causes such ware; but,
                        many
                        things can alter your means of managing this. As you may loose your job, or interest rates go up.
                        <br>&emsp;Wisdom is an odd choice, for it tends to speak of sacred things as if they were novel objects,
                        'and judged as equal as the rest, by their particualar properties'. And as one who is prior to many of
                        these
                        things, I may consider them. It also though, suggests things which are clearly 'less sacred' as being
                        poor:
                        the indulgences if you will. And there is some friction, or mismatching if you will, about caring about
                        avoiding such indulgences, while your efforts are towards those sacred things. For you can eat poorly
                        and
                        raise a child; but you can't enjoy the outdoors as much.
                        <br>&emsp;My cares then tend to be in sympathy. As having no problems ourselves, makes it so we see
                        other's
                        in trouble. By our studies, we are balanced by the broader motions of the world, 'and how in any given
                        circumstance they mostly remain'. But I also see, in admitting that, of whichever parts are weighing,
                        that
                        people feel this weight. And I then mean only to think of them, on their own, with their family and
                        friends,
                        employed as they are, considering this, making adjusmtnets and such. I make similar efforts regarding
                        war,
                        that if someone were to be hurt, in wet by rain, then I'd at least remark how this came to be, 'and not
                        to
                        have unleveled views surrounding this, thematically'.
                        <br>&emsp;But the truth in all of this, is that we, personally, are not so invovled : perhaps wisely,
                        but
                        also without much stability. "Indeed, by the nature of our choices, and the need to be so austere, and
                        the
                        consquent lack of updraft, or pull rather from ahead, if we fail in such austerity and or lack any
                        outside
                        things." We are in serious debt of the latter, and thus, our ways can be a bit wearisome. And in this,
                        we
                        tend to feel the weight of things going around. We try and avoid 'clumped sources', along with having
                        some
                        understanding, in both the worlds effects and people effected. But our need for this come's from me. As
                        I do
                        not relish anyone subject to crime or illness, nor economic strife or depravity. "I don't even ignore
                        the
                        thinning of middle class fortune." But I can see, that this is far beyond me: as my nearest neighbours
                        buisness seems to be. And I can see myself caring from our own removed state; but only to be caught by
                        the
                        pleasures and promise of such 'adventure'. I think, if we were occupied and invovled, as is right and
                        natural ---had we been more open despite our integrity-- then we'd more simply notice. And perhaps, by
                        that,
                        'for in all moments of ease and strenght, we see the world around; and are then pleased or discomofrted
                        by
                        what see: be it the lands or pestulence', then so, if this great yet stable sight was from higher above,
                        'then in our removed solidute', then perhaps our amends would be themselves stronger, and able, in
                        effect,
                        and happily by our confidence, to proceed

                        So there's two thoughts on my mind.
                        <br>&emsp;First, is that I see so much promise and ease from fashioning our thoughts as to be guilded by
                        inquiry. If we were to be asked, or we were to think, may we flourish by the speculative model. For
                        instance, 'is there a God?', is something which holds various elements which give weight to different
                        truths. And in your responses, suggestions or inquiries, you may consider such things, or at least speak
                        to
                        other ideas with these in mind. This is a candid view of this, and perhaps seeps the life from what I
                        think.
                        I just feel like being able to describe what something is, and in regards to say our mind and vision,
                        learning and understanding what is important to that question, makes so you are able and free to ask,
                        and
                        also respond to other's by asking what they think, or at least affirming where you lean, or ulitmatley
                        side
                        with, for such reaons. "For we never know, but at least are concluding on some basis." And my interest
                        then,
                        is to be able to speak to things, be it in descriptions 'regarding what's known', or what is important
                        to
                        consider, 'regarding the mystery of the past or the future'.
                        <br>&emsp;The second point regards a mixture of delight and motion. If the world were black and white,
                        and
                        only upon certain actions did it have color, how much would any of the concenssions required to make
                        such
                        actions be worth? "As I've learned, there are concessions not required, yet we act as so; and it seems
                        this
                        is from us over bearing on the color. But in all honesty, it is more akin to bringing light on the page:
                        even though all the colors are equally vivid. Those other things 'of a non colored sort' seem to be what
                        brings color, 'in those more primal and or excitable motions'. Trying to be so great that our light is
                        found
                        elsewhere, 'perhaps in line with those named actions', wares us down."
                        <br>&emsp;Regarding motion, I see, how unless something is enticing or you can easily create motion,
                        that
                        you will not feel brought forth. This is why we like to share things, as it is easier to bring forward.
                        Ideas even, or fears, upon their excitement, we may wish to bring clarity to them, and so find somewhere
                        that draws them out so they become more defined. I see how those marks, 'as mentioned some time ago',
                        are
                        relevant hear. As I seek a friend to share and convene regarding the sun, in all her beatuy: but only
                        so, by
                        the strict relation I have with her, 'I cannot so her full'. And I have found that reflection and
                        identity
                        go hand in hand in making it easier for me to achieve such a gain. I am not sure of some princiuple
                        weakness
                        in folk who hold less oblige, and find there delights by being around things which exicte and or foster
                        such
                        motion. "Rather, than via our finer clarity, by me." But, as someone who is, in all honesty, stout
                        enough to
                        be so, so in such state, whereby we settle ourselves not on those things which are exciting, 'and of
                        delights of their own', that so, by our finer interests in things seperate, are we indetbed to achieve
                        things fully, 'so that we are then at peace among those around'. For need of them is smaller than the
                        need i
                        have in myself, and this can make it harder to coalesque. But, in are smaller ways, if we are fully
                        shining
                        through, then so can we still be with them. "For we like them, like the sun. But their excitable nature
                        requires more. Having enough for this is something I generally resist, as the form of it is overbearing,
                        comapred to what I really need, and so I offer none. But, in our quality, of charm and peace, so may be
                        offer compartively little, in such form (as we may describe as committment), due to the pungence of our
                        prescence: a dense spot of color and joy." Our care for things around, 'as if were taken away by things
                        of
                        grandeur', is bound in reflection, as are our means to this: for the sight of these things, as to
                        compell me
                        to ordain myself towards them, 'in the simple, yet personal ways', is also bound in such reflection.
                        "Where
                        I've come from to be said way."

                        Theres a sort of dissonance regarding things around us, as our own motions create. If we are still, but
                        at
                        rest, then things come upon us, and we incorporate it; and if there is any trouble, so can we handle it,
                        'without our entirerty being bent upon it'. And conversely, if we are not at such ease, then so our
                        response
                        lay.
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, being in motion create's the sort of ampleness that allows things to come in and
                        leave
                        easily. While being still has a sort of precarity to it, for it is naturaly less substantial; and thus
                        prone
                        to weaker qualities. "While one may be relatively poor, but in a moving state, bear less consquence."
                        <br>&emsp;The point, is that we have things to do, duties, deeds, interests and care. And our remarks
                        here
                        are akin to our muscles feeling flat, or our sleep seeming to struggle do to blood pressure. Our mind,
                        or
                        tranquility, is it's own state of things, which I am suggesting is effected by the nature of our
                        motions.
                        For which I may speak of, or just let the basis sit right here.
                        <br>&emsp;The basic pivoty of which were on, is one where our life is bade towards creativity, and not
                        occupation. For in one, you are progressing, trying for more: working for something far off. While our
                        actual steps are such as to be in the present good. Or at least for things which compell me, and ask
                        that I
                        merely spend my time. There is simply something I wish to do. I'd like to sort our knoweldge into the
                        form's
                        of inquiry, as to better remark, converse or respond to the nature of life, matter, death, war and
                        beauty.
                        I'd like to delve into our past, as to draw more inspiration, or insight, as to why I am so creatively
                        inclined, and perhaps too overt to other people. "As I see it, being near people is about spending time,
                        while I merely wish to bathe in granduer, and by that, apply our efforts to ourselves; as such is the
                        lens.
                        But of this balance, and all the nerves and tension which come from this, is something, beyond the
                        dynamics
                        of this, which can be shown in the roots particular to us, and thus how these effects were produced in
                        me."
                        I love film also, and wish to better know it; as I equally wish for our grand delights. "To better
                        define,
                        and thus better see."
                        <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, we came into our youth, whereupon the deeds of the world were laid
                        infront,
                        'and we were asked to prepare'; and that upon our mild attempt to do so, we entered the world rather
                        alone
                        and timid. But we re-routed ourselves towards that which actually supported our creative interests;
                        rather
                        than that which cultivated a career. The issue in this has never been real contempt by others, but our
                        inability to share that we had cares otherwise. We were not judged; but we could not say that we were
                        feeling poor or off because we were lacking what our 'creative interests' required. I still find this a
                        struggle. But what I've learned, is that this sort of knowledge requires but a mere attendance, as to
                        learn
                        from your mistakes; but aslo therein, a committment, for you to feel good in doing so. We've just never
                        connected, because we held so much emphasis on our flourishing state, that we either aversed ourselves
                        from
                        other people, or simply could not be present. From this, we were never attached enough to stay put, and
                        thus
                        moved often. I've noticed over the recent years that I can be more present, being unafraid at least, or
                        hidden rather; and by that, able to converse about the common elements of our day and lives. This is
                        proficient for peers and friends. But not till much more recent, have I been able to actually share what
                        I
                        like. Namely, this is in games or tv, youtube even; and although I feel unclear on what I'd say, I am
                        getting better, or clear at least, on how to share which music we like. And this has created a more
                        positive
                        experience with people; where I don't feel removed from them, and thus fufilled, but all while were
                        still
                        being ourselves. The natural seperation of our lives leaves us as such. But even those who naturally go
                        their seperate ways may still connect while their there, so in doing this am I less depressed upon
                        failing
                        to do so, and then going home. And indeed, being more present allows me to be closer with people,
                        despite
                        the time I spend with them. And through our life, which has some sort of of pressure on me when it's
                        lacking, so when this is alright am I able to be as though we spend alot of time together. With Amon, I
                        like
                        her, because she's beautiful. But despite this being all I feel, so is our prescence in doing so,
                        wherein
                        acting upon that like, where I try and talk to her, so am I actually present in a way as if I cared for
                        something even more. I understand that such romantic interests may only come about through according
                        kinds
                        of actions, but so may we at least share a pulse, or have some emotional repor. I feel like I could ask
                        where she's from, and so forth. My heart merely sees her, and wishes to interact; and when our fear us
                        unbearing, nor our loined interests causing treipdiation (as if theres this huge stake), then we may
                        fully
                        be, as were pleased to. "I'm just afraind to live without our armour. For we may fail, and by that be
                        withdrawn. But something always sticks with you, and I feel like where we are indubitably, is one where
                        we
                        need not fetter. Just love the outdoors, nurture your inquiry, enjoy Youtube and Games. And you need not
                        save the world: you've got no anwser. Where we go in life may be in producing something postive, or
                        removing
                        negative. It may be in big positions or small ones. Let's be a man though; and in our boldness, work
                        from
                        nothing but the simplicity of that."

                        So there is the possibility that Amon likes you. Seeing as I like her, maybe we could hang out, go on a
                        date, make love. But to what end? Well, I see how many of these things come together than spread apart.
                        I
                        don't wish to be her boyfriend, as I don't like her in that way. I just think she's beautiful, and I am
                        interested in her as such. I little crush if you will.
                        <br>&emsp;My fear is that we cannot like her if we don't mean to go all in. But this is not true. If we
                        like
                        eachother, let us go out, hang out, chat, be intimate. Like were dating. And if it comes to an end, let
                        it
                        be so naturally. But this can happen. Your free to like her, for you need not avoid it happening. "As if
                        you'd be entering some agreement which you intend not on filling." I'd just like to date. Simple. Nor am

                        So I see that were a bit hesitant, or at least with a beat that is unsprung, or reserved. This is so,
                        for I
                        do not know what I see, simply.
                        <br>&emsp;In some sense, this is so, for of the things which may make me move, or seem to in deep ways,
                        that
                        so do these require so much. Only, of the requirments, I have tended not to respect them, and thus their
                        ardent use for an otherwise good end.
                        <br>&emsp;But this is confused. I understand the idea of love, 'in all her offer and glory' is something
                        sweet and plenty, but is it really something you want? I recall moments where I have, but it was only
                        when I
                        thought the person I liked was going away. "For I in truth, just wanted ot be me, knowing they were

                        So I thought I'd reflect on this past game, as it pertains to our future military one.
                        <br>&emsp;To begin, we must remember, that be it +10 settlement limit or 4 at end of antiquity, you
                        still
                        start the age with 8, then 16 in modern. Happiness is not generally an issue, though, with Rome for
                        instance, you do want enough policy slots to fit in (the potentially irrelevant) traditions, along with
                        things to boost your economy. So you don't want to go to much over your limit, but 1 is generally
                        acceptable
                        ---as you can get villages that give you good amounts of happiness.
                        <br>&emsp;Regarding city states, their so important, despite being expensive. I am not sure if getting
                        your
                        first suzerain triggers a diplo point, despite it happening before. I think obvious momento is military,
                        and
                        Gate of Nations on top of that. But taking a diplo one with the hope of getting Emille Belle, or a diplo
                        point is gamble. At any rate, city states scale by how many you have of any sort. Regarding combat, you
                        can
                        get +1 on your infantry for each city state. This makes a military state crucial for our early game,
                        then
                        adding more throughout the age. Equally important, is that you must protect the state, as your enemies
                        will
                        attack it ---either during a war with you, or as a specific target.
                        <br>&emsp;The first choice of your game is which golden age you want. You benefit somewhat from getting
                        complete points for each, but only one can use the tier 3. Science and Culutre each carry over their
                        respective tier two buildings, while Economics keeps your cities from this age. I believe military just
                        gives units per city, which feels irrelevant compared to more yields. And, in our conquest aim, were
                        less
                        likely to convert to cities, as we don't need so much infastrucutre, but military. So economic seems
                        less a
                        priority, as were less likely to convert all our cities and build them up. It depends on the gold
                        though, as
                        having a few cities which you put in some academies or amphitheatres may not be so beneficial.
                        <br>&emsp;At any rate, taking influence early on is important, though, science is much more important
                        for
                        conquest, as it get's you to bronze working, the wheel, the tier 3 techs, plus masteries. Taking the
                        science
                        skill that boosts mastery progression is a benefit.
                        <br>&emsp;In exploration, you have two strips of islands which get filled up by all sides. In modern,
                        our
                        goal is to capture a chunk of settlements that are not folowing our ideology; which means we must have
                        one,
                        and them. At a baseline, you can terroize the seas, capturing all the coastal settlements, likely
                        getting a
                        bunch of treasure fleets --for economic boosts in the modern age. One possibility is in the culture
                        golden
                        age, which retrains your religios effects. I think the thing I'm unclear about, is the extent to which I
                        can
                        conquer, as I only have so much settlement limit. Second, is how were supposed to develop our economy,
                        when
                        were so focused on military. I suspect theirs a balance, where you get tons of cities; and this doesn't
                        take
                        the world, but select attacks backed up by generals and proper units. This increases your economy
                        overall,
                        and, in particlar, if your taking cities, then their's infastrucutre already there.

                        How would you describe the world, in order to root your inquiry?
                        <br>&emsp;Well, you ought know the proportions of it. That form of breadth and depth, so doth the
                        present
                        and history lay. The actual lands are not so much an issue, but where people lie; and at that, how many.
                        It
                        is not likely that you can name every town, nor count the amount people in each; but you can say how
                        many
                        their are. Population is an odd thing, as it is more of a qualifier, in terms of how many towns of X
                        population their are; rather than something which described any particular town. You may look at the
                        world,
                        and see, again, how many towns have more than a million folk. You may also speak to the towns of an
                        extremely large sort, like Tokyo, Lagos or Bangok. In fact, of these, those which are remarkable become
                        a
                        world of their own, and thus warrant their own disseminated view ---in they way their divided, and the
                        motions of those inside.
                        <br>&emsp;Past values are important to, ie. the people of Athens or Rome, of old Britan, France or
                        China, to
                        modern.
                        <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are the motions of the world, or objects rather. How much coal is consumed,
                        and
                        otherwise extracted. How much fresh water is in use; how many comparatively have some than those prior.
                        The
                        amount of food produced, the amount of waste. Emission levels and associated metrics. How many people
                        travel, tour, immigrate, die, are killed, crash, are impoverished, are black, old, disabled.
                        <br>&emsp;Grip these facts: it is better know some absolutely, then be wishy washy about all. "We are
                        only
                        what we can speak of; for we can only listen, and until practiced, pretend: and we don't even do these
                        as
                        good as we could if we have not formed something to begin."
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing is in our inidivual motions. For we each breathe, eat and sleep; but also drink
                        coffee, smoke, poop and pee, look at our phones and watch tv, recycle or not, use water, be it cold or
                        hot.
                        We earn average amounts of income, spend average amounts of taxes, or on expenses. We have rights,
                        restrictions, addendums and deeds. "But these are perhaps less about us, than the complex which manages
                        us:
                        and the center for politics, regarding those managing such complex." Of those, you have servants,
                        officials,
                        higher ups; and these are split from branches to departments, as secretaries or assistants.
                        <br>&emsp;There are events, from the Trojan War, to that from Persia or in the Pelopanesse; to
                        Alexanders
                        assault, the Punic, to Greece's conqueing by Rome, to Caeser's civil war. To the barbarian conflicts,
                        through Byzantine, Lombards and the Franks. To the century of England and France, to 1550 France and
                        1600
                        Germany. To the disputes of Sweden, Russia, Netherlands and Spain, to 1812, Mexico, Bohr and
                        Franco-Prussia.
                        Then Korea, Nam, Gulf Wars and Iraq. Along with those in Africa, or other odd ends; be it Rwanda or
                        Yugoslavia.

                        I'm nervous about Amon. She's got me riled up. Because she's beautfiul, and I want to see her naked, to
                        kiss
                        her, lick her pussy, fuck her hard. I want her to grab my dick, such it and ride me. Oh my.
                        <br>&emsp;But the reality is, that I need only show my interest, by saying hellow, how are you, talking
                        about the job. "Just the other day, I said that she did not have to scan the door, as it was now
                        automatic."
                        Further, ask her about herself, where she came from, who she is; and by that, maybe she'll ask you.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel this interest is leaned too forward onto those haughty pleasures. And so, by virute of
                        being at work, and not seeing her too much, makes it so the effort I can put in, feels ineffective; and
                        thus
                        I feel pushed to do more; yet, I cannot do so much, out of sense, and thus I wish to call the whole
                        thing. I
                        don't want regrets, but I am struggling to handle just doing what's right.
                        <br>&emsp;I don't believe she is young, or too young at least, as I've seen her there often: and she
                        would
                        be in school otherwise. But she may have a boyfriend, or be simply uninterested. She may live near
                        Surrey,
                        'as I heard her remark that she found something near Guildford'. But she also may not want to engage
                        with
                        someone at work. Even if I make her heart flutter, or make her nervous, she may not want to go through
                        with
                        anything. "I'm thinking of Kelly back at Save-On." This is why learning about her and telling her about
                        you
                        make's you more commensurable; and is not some heartfelt fling: which is hard for anyone to act on. "And
                        may
                        mean less to the other person. I'm thinking of Holly, who did not care for me in the same way I did for
                        her."
                        <br>&emsp;Perhaps, the anwser is to be unafraid, and not linger on the thought, expecting something. Do
                        as
                        you please, in that you would ask her about her background; for your interest is compelled to do so.
                        That is
                        what I'd like to know: it's as if I am entering her further. This is natural. But you can do this
                        without
                        much planning, nor need of much. This is how you ought live generally, in that you may ask people things
                        and
                        be asked about yourself. This is how you inquire and respone truly and freely; and not, as it once was,
                        with
                        trepadtation or fabrication; where you were nervous to be upfront and honest, or were forming something
                        else
                        you'd prefer to say. Josh for instance, ask him where he's from, what he plans to do. Ask Sam if she
                        likes
                        Nintendo. Ask people about their families, their background, their life. Amon, because she is pretty,
                        and
                        for no reason else, is someone I would like to get closer to; so when you can ask her. "As if it were a
                        little dance."

                        Regarding data and information, there are official sources, whose reliability is high via the
                        instituional
                        and or civil nature. References include Britannica and factbooks, while Wikiepedia is User Currated; but
                        is
                        thus not a primary source, but can be verified. "As a platform, it aims to highlight where information
                        given
                        is noted as being drawn from some source --as listed in references below-- or that its lacking." News
                        Articles are similar, as yuo trust that the information is properly sourced. Though, the issue is in the
                        editorialized and rheotic nature; meaning, that althoguh there are facts, there may also be conjecture
                        and
                        or opinions: these are fine, but ought be distingusihed between facts. General websites are no different
                        in
                        principle, but are not held to so high an authority, 'that the facts are properly sourced', and so more
                        discretion is advised; as some sites may not show their sources, or may have done so improperly. The
                        news is
                        a reputable source for properly sharing information from officual outlets; but they are not officual
                        sources
                        themselves, merely organized currations. "Wikipedia is equal, but without uniform collaboration; as any
                        person can contribute; while a news source is an organization, and prided on their reliability in
                        quality
                        sourcing." Acadmic sources are by nature dense, but so much as their peer reviewd, they may be
                        themselves
                        offical, or primary rather.
                        <br>&emsp;It is also worth noting aggregators, which act as currators of the pure data given by primary
                        sources --statistica, worldomotets. These can be a bit misleading at times, but only if you are not
                        aware of
                        the dataset in which their figures are drawn from.
                        <br>&emsp;In other words, information is found and given, and those who do so are deemed primary and
                        offical. "The governmetns and researchers of the world." While delivery of this may be done first hand,
                        or
                        thorugh curration; be it Wikipedia, Vogue, or a blog.
                        <br>&emsp;On that note, the U.N is one of thee main officual services. They account for 195 countries in
                        the
                        world, two (Palestine and Vatican) being somewhat partial. There are 6 habitable continents: North
                        America,
                        South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Europe and Asia may be considered Eurasia. There are 54
                        countires in
                        Africa, 49 in Asia, 44 in Europe, 14 in Oceania, 33 in Latin/South America, and Canada plus U.S.A in
                        North
                        America. South American has 12 countries, 8 in central (if you include Mexico), and 14 in carribean.
                        Known
                        as Latin America, there's 33 in total, 22 in what's known as central america.
                        <br>&emsp;So a country is composed of primary and secondary divisions, ie. provinces and states, and
                        counties and or districts within those.
                        <br>&emsp;Within Asia, there are 3000 primary divisions, 1500 in Europe, 1000 in South America, 200 in
                        Oceania, 63 in Canada+US, and over 1000 in Africa. Thats about 6500 provinces, regions and states.

                        So, municipalties are the actual pieces of the world, as it is where people actually live. These are
                        grouped
                        into districts/counties, which are then grouped into provinces/regions/states, and those into a country.
                        <br>&emsp;Canada has approx. 3600 towns ---which we'll define as municipalities and cities too. "this is
                        from 2021 population census. Canada"
                        <br>&emsp;The U.S has 16,400 incorporated --legally defined place, under law-- places above 1000.
                        <br>&emsp;Mexico has abou 2500, central america besides this has 1100, and carribean has near 800,
                        totalling
                        4400 for all central america.
                        <br>&emsp;South America has 7600 municipalties, 5600 coming from Brazil.
                        <br>&emsp;Africa has 11,500 ---out of 54 countries.
                        <br>&emsp;Europe is brimming with such municipalities (over 1000), reaching near 90,000. France alone
                        has
                        34,000.
                        <br>&emsp;Mid East has 6700, Asia has a massive 143,000. China has 39,000 of this, India with 41,000.
                        And I
                        will note, that this definition of municipality begins at 1000 people, as this to me remarks a defined
                        community, and thus complex/system/ array of human action, and is thus worth our regard. A farmstead for
                        instance is more of a family and less of a network of interaction, and something to be judged outside
                        itself.
                        <br>&emsp;Oceania has 1900.

                        america has 51m, Carribean equally. South America is relatiavely small compared to other continents,
                        with
                        only 430m. Africa, in comparison, is huge, tripling that value to 1.43 billion. Europe is large, with
                        near
                        750m. Mid East has just over 300m, while Asia is massive, with 4.1 billion people. Oceania is small,
                        with
                        45m. In total, as of 2023, the world has 8.045 billion people. This amounts to about .9
                        growth per year, or 200,000 people a day ---73 million per year.
                        <br>&emsp;Historically, in during the neolithic era, into agriculture, there were some short amount of
                        millions of
                        people. It's estimated there were about 15 million as the roots of civilizations began -- 5000 BC. This
                        value kept
                        increasing in multiples ever millenia, from 45m in 3000bc to some range of 50-100m in 1000Bc. At the
                        birth of christ,
                        there were some few hundred million people; the Romans accounting for upwards of 70 million of this.
                        Through the
                        medieval age, the levels remained in the couple 100 million, being cut severely by the black plague; the
                        population did
                        not recover till the 16th century. By 1800 the population had reached a billion, and 1.6 by 1900. 2 bill
                        was hit by 1927
                        --taking 127 years from 1800--- then another 33 to hit 3 billion (1960). 14 years to 4 (74), and again
                        to 5 (87), and
                        consecutivley, it's been 12 years per bill, from 1999, 2011, 2023. It took the world all of ancient time
                        to reach a
                        hundred million, and from there, it took some two to three thousand years to reach a billion. It took
                        only 127 years to
                        reach another billion, then some shrinking number of decades to reach subsquent billions. From 1927 till
                        now, we've
                        added near 6 billion: in 100 years! Also, life expectancy rose from an average 31 in 1900, to 73. And

                        mortality dropped from an average 40

                        I admitt that our doubts come from trepidation; in that, less we can say what we mean, clear and
                        positively,
                        then those who deem themselves right will denounce me.
                        <br>&emsp;But, no matter, I find much advantage in seeing our affairs, or comments rather, along the
                        lines
                        of value and resolve.
                        <br>&emsp;For in one, you have the basis of your life, the bed, the food, humanity. And then you have
                        the
                        amends to such things: the screws which fit value'd hole.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I submitt our precious affair with vitality. For I find so much worth and fecundity
                        in
                        our harmony with it; and as such, to the goods which, being deemed so, bring our hand to hers.
                        <br>&emsp;Similarly, I've found great respite in the simple conventions of the world. Being polite and
                        inalterable infront of policemen or those at some formal desk. To friends, I learn about them, and
                        provide
                        them the same. And to all things correspondance, I try and speak simple. The words I've chosen have not
                        always worked, nor have my choices brought me to any real success: but I at least know that life is not
                        some
                        game. "And the worse part of our aging account, is how we overted ourselves away, as if it were, and we
                        did
                        not wish to participate." More and more can I just show up, but while being me, open, free and happy.
                        "Romance, friendship, oppertunity and or lick, are more surely coming; or at least, in possibility,
                        bound to
                        stay."
                        <br>&emsp;I sympathize with those who are not so willfully peacefull; or are burdened by their choices:
                        how
                        the road is rough for them at least. But I do say, with humble certainty, that by my civil accounts,
                        national security is all too common, as are our state affairs more indeluable than that. Nor, in my
                        submission, 'which others may not realize that this is all they'd be asked to do', is no fault by me;
                        for we
                        already live simply; and nothing which I care for or am enlivened against, is brought by any venture or
                        plea, which potential restrictions may apply. It is possible that we are locked in our homes, or
                        sentenced
                        to death. These are grave and unfathomable, but still, able to be adjusted to if they come to be. "And
                        you
                        can always lower your hand, and offer your throat. For by a corporal blade or time's demand, so am I set
                        for
                        deep tranquility."

                        I live in a dream, some sort of scene built by imagery. Yet I feel this wrong, 'as it's completey
                        centered
                        around ne', as a kid often experiencs.
                        <br>&emsp;Yet, when I sit back, and gaze at the real world, I see how ignorant I am, how little I know;
                        how
                        virtually in all areas, I can speak so little of.
                        <br>&emsp;This is not damnation upon, but a symptom of our lack of aim. For in my studies I can see, how
                        wide and dipsered man's actions are; and how, even in our most engaged and reactive sight, 'that so much
                        of
                        which is common and of the norm, good or not, slides past our sight'. As such, our aim would be
                        welcomed,
                        'for I would not fret if our care was for that, and not for any perceived misfortunes of others'. For
                        that
                        would be the mark of a dream: and our care for a goal within reality is not contrasted to an otherwise
                        illusory view: in which people may seem to be settled in.
                        <br>&emsp;It would be one thing, if we leaved in paradise, but still lacked an aim; whereby we were free
                        to
                        reach for anything, but were otherwise given nothing. In this muddling state, we see somewhat that
                        other's
                        are in trouble around. Or better said, we feel morally shamed, and pridefully stricken at being so
                        unclear
                        and ambivolent. I recognize that this may come from the nature of our values, in that they are of
                        ourselves.
                        Yet, by virtue of our harmony with them, and the recent relinquish of any honor and or fielty to them,
                        'as
                        if doing them was some sort of value in itself, rather than the effect they bade', that so are we merely
                        growing, and further trying to acquiese. In many ways, this remarks the care for our experience, and
                        nothing
                        which comes from an abandoment of this loose threads. For when they are tight we are content; but by the
                        way
                        of nature, still subject to things, but thereby with a calm yet mighty response: for which we gain.
                        <br>&emsp;It seems clear that our personal interests were not benefited by our conclusion to hollow
                        away,
                        all private, and at best in solitude. Not only was this not a benefit to the actions themselves, but it
                        also
                        removed us from other pleasing actions: one's which were in truth concordent with these personal ones.
                        <br>&emsp;In a similar sense to our doubt's upon thinking of an aim, 'as we feel so lost prior', so in
                        the
                        cares of our actions, does passion sit upon our groundless self, whereby the threads below, if left
                        unattended, make for top heavy interests, 'rather than those on sturdy grounds'. From such grounds our
                        cares
                        naturally blossom.
                        <br>&emsp;I don't mean to be ideal though. For broad strokes may be given, officially or in curration.
                        And
                        as such, I see how our own impression may be strengthed as not to feel afraind or sympathetic in an
                        illusory
                        way. My ignorance remains as to our personal action's, and that of other's personally, but that is all
                        we
                        can really make for. Else, we are but straddled by a weary state upon our inner choices, or beckoned and
                        emabalmed to the silky view ahead. "For we never wish to stay still, and thus ordain to ourselves, or
                        dream
                        ahead."
                        <br>&emsp;What I wish to remark then, is how, in our less than grinding efforts, ought we be ahead. For
                        I
                        see, perhaps, that a true state of grace bears no imposition on us, and we are thus pleased and plump to
                        proceed. By media, slack choices, and the wear of work, are we at the very least tilted, and by that, in
                        a
                        less than contented state. I naturally settle back, but thereby feel in less motion. "For we never bade
                        to
                        that which promised us something outside our inner self. Nor, in our choice for the latter, have we
                        began to
                        move from our harmony with that. And so, having returned to strenght I ask."
                        <br>&emsp;There's just enough in our life, that this still remarks may be but soft comments on our
                        drifting
                        gait; a pace of which will increase. We have our health and minor home affairs, our small workload and
                        it's
                        social compartement. The sun comes and goes, and offers not always her brightest show. So our health is
                        beckoned to, in being able enough to let us be both drawn and amended. "And so, in our respite of this,
                        may
                        we study the land, in both history and dynamics, as to see the tendancy of when she come's, and of what
                        manner." For we may not fear to forget, and, in line with our baser harmonies, 'the rythm of which
                        extends
                        on, as if a melody according to my life,' may we feel naturally treated by the motion of such path, 'and
                        what is simply expected to come'.

                        In some odd sense, I contend that our hygiene is what distinguishes us all. And as, for the most part,
                        we
                        don't berate and or snide regarding someone's culture or race, so do we not remark upon their smell. We
                        do
                        these things for appearence; but because this is not that important. "You can laugh easier at someone
                        for
                        something unessential."
                        <br>&emsp;And my feeling in all of this, is of all the things I care to do, or am asked by, so is it my
                        hygiene which asks the most. Interestingly, it may seem otherwise, that it is in fact easy and smooth.
                        But
                        only, as I'd suspect, because it is so essential and we do so much. But when I am drunk, tired, sick and
                        what not, brushing my teeth, bathing, washing our sheets and clothes, this is the last thing I wish to
                        do.
                        "And how many of us, so decadent and fine, have messy rooms, or bags, or cars."

                        Being me, oh, how so fine this is, and rich in plenty. More can be done sure, as there are mountains and
                        clouds to further gleam; but oh my, is there enough to make me full.
                        <br>&emsp;Our rythm is strict and simple. Wake up, quickly change, and off you go. Prioritize your work,
                        converse, go home and redress, then run, breathe, write and or play. A rainy day only brings me closer,
                        trying our habits, holding us off from warmer times. But we are still warm by me.
                        <br>&emsp;The spring air is coming, soft dry grass, fluffy clouds, mellow evenings showing mountains far
                        and
                        high. We are not so poor in our affairs, as we have some money, are without debt, hold much privalge and
                        fortune; but still guided by strenght, sensibility, and a more or less able hand. "One of which, however
                        less in proportiona, is in motion; and thus not burdened by idle scorn: I already am."
                        <br>&emsp;I hear though that many die from cars, or depression, or even murder; and all illness to boot;
                        from this spot of land to those beyond Barute. And I can't help but think that were unafraid of this;
                        and
                        considering how well we are about it, so are future fears not further burdens. "We're already fine with
                        the
                        way things are. By ignorance though." National and or state security feels like something none tarnish
                        lightly. And it is wise to remember that in the past, much time and or provocation has occured for these
                        things to occur. Such things are thematically common, but usually with time in between. "In those
                        moments,
                        the prior conflicts were a memory; like our own adolescence, or youth rather, and how it seemed an age
                        ago.
                        Covid evne seems long forgotten."
                        <br>&emsp;I feel lost without devotion; to ourselves or the world. But I am fundementally thrown off,
                        for
                        what it's worth, when the unneccessity of such is made by our natural fortuity, and calm and merry
                        harmony
                        with such; but, if and when were out of touch, we are not ourselves, nor so morally devoted, 'as if
                        there
                        were some brace, be it to what's outside or in'. I have consented to such strucutres in the past, but
                        only
                        see them as consallations for the inability to merrily be. Such is the cost of our actions, being so
                        near,
                        but born only of honest resolve; and results which naturally further

                        It seems our debt in time, to floudner over the proper regards for living. Do we remark upon such things
                        as
                        if they were objects, and gently drift among them, 'by ease, earning their gain', or devoting ourselves?
                        Or
                        is this just something basic which we ought not so primarily regard: even if communicating such things
                        is
                        hard, and perhaps a motivator, or impetus for you to see them in the former way.
                        <br>&emsp;What is so odd then about these things. For you know their important, by virute of their
                        abscence
                        at least. Nor do you always wish to abide. I think where I lie, is that, be it for promise or
                        sustenance,
                        you in some oblige, and all things mold themselves as either neccessary or complimentary elements. Where
                        I
                        lie, is that this sort of direction, 'or guiding line', does not apply to me; or never has at least.
                        I've
                        found so much ease and pleasantry in the simplicity of life, and albeit lined with much of the comforts
                        which that common life provides, so were these consumed by our childish basis: for the effects of them
                        had
                        no responsibility which we deemed them contradicotry towards. I"ve just never found much more to life
                        then
                        this.
                        <br>&emsp;There are just so many things to consider, and I tend not to remark up but a few. And I take
                        great
                        respite in this, for, in ignoring so much, and nothing ill coming to pass, I see how little things
                        matter.
                        It is my particularly place in the world which affords this; but still, even those in much worse of
                        places,
                        would likely see that there was little but the most basest of restrictions or intrustions which affected
                        them at all.
                        <br>&emsp;I sit simply, in this ample mode, which says that near and within, there lies a world of
                        possible
                        regard; and that from donig so, you become stable, happy and pure. While those who rest above this, find
                        much care and pleasure in the broader things of the world. This is fine, but is not enjoyed in the same
                        way
                        had you been more inwardly fine. Nor, in doing so, do you find either much interest or ability (to
                        pursuse)
                        such farther ends. As you see already the paradise around. "IT is just ever so hard to meet this: for it
                        requires you to be honest, give up glory and acclaim, nor pronounce the indifference in the world, as if
                        something ill won't happen. Were just too fine with it ."

                        It is not wrong for me not to be right. I'd give my life for another with a calm charm; though, I
                        wouldn't
                        necceasrily take that of another to do so. If need be I would, but not in defensive aggression. But my
                        morals, my honor, my plea, is not but an inquiry. As to the world and what it may be; and how my
                        personal
                        experience, or dealings rather, speak to me, and in which ways might our impression of this be wrong.
                        <br>&emsp;For my sensibilities are innately modern, as all books I've read or words I've heard, 'being
                        raised in a non ecclesiast school', is secular, naturally driven, and otherwise contemporily modern. As
                        such, when a hurricane appears, or some great incident spurrs infront my eyes, I have little inclination
                        to
                        believe it is anything but nature making this. The point being, that I have very little suscipions of
                        anything, and am thus inclined to let things be, as they seem naturally, and align ourselves as if those
                        actions continue to be.
                        <br>&emsp;In a word, our mode of being is one that is in harmony with nature, as she seems at least, and
                        is
                        (by our baser inclinations) effective ordinarily. And so I my expeirence with things is taken at such a
                        glance, and not by anything of a miraculous or revealed sort. "Nature is just being her way, and we are
                        in
                        relation to that; and ordering ourselves accordingly; with expectations at least."
                        <br>&emsp;This is just an explanation as to why I may feel so comfortable as I do. For, with nature
                        acting
                        rather continuously, and not being willfully governed or arranged as some esteem, than my harmony in
                        life is
                        brought by our rapor with the apparent motions of nature. This is just a result of us treating things so
                        naturally, and, in this being so original, so are we left we not pretensions about death. For the topic
                        never comes up; nor am I driven to through curiosity to anything built on what I cannot see. It is so
                        hard
                        to feel like it is not an end of nothing. Which I can only describe though as peacefull and plenty. "I
                        have
                        no pretensions regarding there being an afterlife, and any risk of not entering it. Nor, of any
                        recourse, as
                        if there were some harsh alternative. Nor, in any sentimental way, are we endowed to the concept of a
                        soul,
                        and how, in no longer living, this is somehow poor: if, that is, we simply enter a deep and barren
                        rest." My
                        natural living procurres much grace to the alternative, and, more or less, natural perspective: as it
                        relates to what I am best given in our living harmony, a mere moments rest. "An eternity of which is not
                        so
                        begrudging."
                        <br>&emsp;The world has rooted me such though, as it offers me nothing else; anything it does is of a
                        natural sort, 'while those who esteem otherwise, do so by their means and right, but privately, and with
                        no
                        contempt or ardour'. As such, the world has flowed along, and become, in its bearings, rather natural:
                        seeing life, or the people in it rather, as equal in kind and as such equally deserving.
                        <br>&emsp;In our scenario though, there is nothing old about me, in our whimsy and ways. But, in this,
                        while
                        those encased by the past do so with no reign or fury, 'but privatley as they please', so are we
                        otherwise
                        in the world of liberty; but one, in which the roots of it are mending the pains of the past: be it in
                        civility or institutiional resolve. I am otherwise amidst the open plains of freedom and beauty. But
                        alone
                        somewhat. As most folk seem sequestered in their occupations and pleasantry. While others are in the
                        mines,
                        the pits so to speak, mending the pipes, 'and speaking out to those up on the common land, asking them
                        to
                        stop throwing their garbage and filth inside'.
                        <br>&emsp;I take for granted that our life is so free and fine, that I don't actually know if a pipe
                        could
                        burst below. I am just not sure. And this bother's me, for in that end, I am swalloed like the rest.

                        What would make me happy? Someone to play games with! It would be so much easier, as I cannot find it in
                        me
                        to play things, less there new, or their for me. This is hard to find though, and I acknowledge that.
                        Perhaps we could do a better job of finding out what people like, even if on the face of it, were not so
                        compatable, or more than collegues.
                        <br>&emsp;What I seek is vitality, and an ample process to it. I like what comes from this naturally,
                        and in
                        that motion, I can stear, or guide it at least, 'like a kite in the wind'.
                        <br>&emsp;Maybe an important aspect is of our skinnienss, and how for years, this has generally
                        pressured me
                        into exercising in ways unfitting for happiness. For I care for things of the latter, but ware myself
                        down
                        when I do the former in excess --for other reasons. It seems, that you need only be active. And upon
                        doing
                        so, stand, fold, hold and sit with a sort of deliberation, if your natural gait cares not. This is
                        enough.
                        Running, with some added squats, pushups perhaps, and or pullups if the time is right. This is a fine
                        line
                        of activity, easy to follow or lead into work, and can, by your state, extend into those rigorous
                        motions.
                        Just being active is always enough. And by our sense may we properly stretch, or, if dullness or
                        workedness
                        holds you back, then follow a guide: or some other means of doing so deliberately.

                        So I am not sure how Amon feels. I suspect she is not so romantically inclined. She may even be married.
                        I
                        am not certain of her last name, but, how it is in my memory, I saw someone on facebook ---who
                        coincidentally looks alot like her-- and that person was married. At any rate, she may just be
                        responding to
                        me, as I have been relatively nice. She makes weird laughs, like she's nervous; but this could not be
                        the
                        case.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I stand, is that i really don't care for her that much ; I want her, as i did Simron,
                        but I
                        don't actually like her that much. There isn't much to give then, and the sex and romance, or idea at
                        least,
                        which I'd love, is a mere fantasy. I won't speak for all women, but their people; and like Holly, have
                        their
                        own live's. Who they like, or are already dating, is a mere elemnt of their life, drawn by what they
                        actually see. We've always been quick to belef that we are so likable; but likely because we are very
                        open,
                        with energy and kind. But that they respond to this in any fashion, does not mean their entranced by
                        you.
                        <br>&emsp;She may not be the person I'm with, and, admittedly, the feeling I get is one where she does
                        like
                        me. But I will not stand firm with this. Nor am I of the belief that we can 'hit it then quit it'. I'd
                        rather live right, and get what I need.

                        So things are well, as am I. Were pretty even, and quite grounded in our work and ways.
                        <br>&emsp;I am noticing though that were not so privy to fun; and the notion of going for a smoke with
                        our
                        friends, or out with a woman, is quite sombering. I've not procurred any of this, and for the most part,
                        I'm
                        not to drawn to these things. But when were not so thrilled, or feeling a bit idle, I feel this weight,
                        'as
                        if a defensive means to cope with our lack', which says such things are bad.
                        <br>&emsp;This respnose, albeit a mark of our lack, but also a mere exageration of what I really feel,
                        'which is not to woman or drugs', is really brought out when we lack sight of our actual cares. The sun
                        and
                        her coming, the clouds and their pace; games, shows, videos and craft, all swim together in a stream of
                        interest. Yet, like fish, they go on by, leaving me with mere glimmers, 'of there underwater
                        complexion'.
                        <br>&emsp;So, it is nice out, a bit chilly, but with a fair amount of clouds. There quite dense, adding
                        to
                        the chill, but not so much from the south. If there is overcast, then the early day will bear our
                        grandeur.
                        But if there is some clarity in the sky, then the evening will hold some deep blues. I mean to go to
                        freshco
                        for springrolls, and Superstore for Djon chips, but I'm not sure if we should go this afternoon, or wait
                        for
                        the approach to night.
                        <br>&emsp;So theres a bit of a blurr in the north, and tuffs in the south.Things seem to be blowing
                        upwards,
                        which bodes well for the afternoon. But it is cold, so we'll have to bundle up for the evening. I don't
                        mean
                        to eat till after then, so we could go then. But I might just go this afternoon, and have our grains
                        prior
                        to the stroll. Maybe we'll go down Ford; but if it's to cold we'll stay in the town. "The open land can
                        be
                        windy."

                        Thematically, I sought war. But practically, I see more promise form exploration domination --of the
                        seas if
                        you will. Your settlement is naturally low in antiquity, and your ability to match the Ai's strenght is
                        here
                        most handicapped. A true war game would see us prioritize such conquest; though, to what further end I
                        do
                        not know. But as regards our exploration seige, so does this require science. There is benefit,
                        generally,
                        in having 5 cities of your own plus 2 which you take; as this gives +2 settlement limit in exploration.
                        You
                        may arrange your targts and or relations for the end of the age, and take those 2, or, if it pleases
                        you,
                        attack another's major settlements. The most important thing is having an empire which is close
                        together. It
                        means that resoruces can be exchanged, but, primarily, you can support yourelf defensvieyl. If your too
                        spread out, then you have to send units over long distances, and, because you don't know how much you
                        need,
                        you end up sending more. If everything is close, you may surive with less, and back them up more easily
                        if
                        need be. This allows for focosu on your economy. Equally, if your empire is secure, than you can spend
                        that
                        prolonged amount of production on protecting your city states. Your own settlements ought not be the
                        same.
                        <br>&emsp;No matter, the question of exploration rests on whether to invest in cities, build them up,
                        then
                        retain a culture or science element. Or do you retain the gold, and keep them as cities. For you will
                        have
                        to buy them again; at least to be productive. At the very least you want one coastal settlement; as you
                        can
                        freely select this as your second capital. The third city then is 200, and I believe the fourth is 400.
                        If
                        you consider then, that your early exploration cities can only build units and warehouse buildings, then
                        it
                        does not seem necessary for you to have so much. Meaning, if you spend the gold in antiquity to convert
                        a
                        bunch of cities, you benefit less from keeping them as cities, as there's little for them to do;
                        comapred to
                        benefiting from the productions of their antiquity state. The more cities with academies means a better
                        science start. This may transition into cities being sought; but for 600 gold you'll have 4 as it is.
                        And
                        there is not the same advantage going into modern for having so many cities. You may keep them as
                        cities,
                        which is equally unpromising for early modern as it was for early exploration; you can get university
                        boosts, like academies --their inherent is nearly the same. Or, you can keep your relgious founder
                        belief.
                        This may amount to +4 gold, science or culture per foreign settlement. You can spam missionaries near
                        the
                        end of the age, and with a few turns left, convert everyone, then have a big mass of +4s. This could
                        fairly
                        reach 100 yields. Even if you have 10 cities, which is perhaps unrealistic, your likely to have +5 base
                        yields on universites, and some manner of +2-3 adj. This isn't bad, but costs a huge amount of gold; as
                        you
                        must make everything into cities, then research the end of science tree to get university, then have
                        time to
                        build them. It may be easier converting 20 settlements, then having 8 cities with +10 universites.

                        I seldom speak of the morning, 'as such light not often reaches my eyes'. But, even then, there is that
                        first sliver of light, which adds a tingling of white and blue. Then, leading into the sun, there is
                        that
                        awning of visibility, a moment of red; followed then by the narrow stream of yeloowing, piercing the
                        trees.
                        "this compares with those final moments of sunset, when the light is so horiztonal, it shines through
                        everything: equally so on the rise."
                        <br>&emsp;From here my day is guided more by habit than lust. But, early on, there is a quiet tone to
                        the
                        color, and thereby no rush to go out (especially) and see. But the sun does come over the horizon, and
                        from
                        there, bathes the land prominently in light. Here, everything is seen in full color and saturation, but
                        not
                        so washed out by the pinnacle point of light, when the sun is strictly over head. "The in between of
                        dawn
                        and midday."
                        <br>&emsp;As she hits her peak, and falls over, you get a warmth softness to everything. Where the heat
                        of
                        the day has sunk in, and in east, the sky is a rich blue. This is one of my favorite times, as
                        everything is
                        allowed to have it's full saturation and color, 'as that midpoint to midday'; only, with the sun having
                        been, and falling away, everything feels a bit more cooked and heated; but, to the point, almost settled
                        from that peak moment during midday; whereupon the color and creamness is all there is, but withotu that
                        washing light, 'as the sun reaches early evening'.
                        <br>&emsp;During that though, when day is coming to set, you have a sort of cease of natural warmth, and
                        instead pure vibrance. For whatever reason, this setting holds longer color than it does when rising;
                        and as
                        such, if there are wisps of cloud in the air, so is this setting nice. The light come's to that parallel
                        pitch, shining onto houses and through trees, then fully hides. From here, there is a pale boredom,
                        'similar
                        to that moment right before sunrise'. But, as this paleness deepens, there's left a contrast of color on
                        the
                        mountains and clouds. The sky begins to thicken, deepening from quiet to thick dark blue. If the gods
                        are
                        generous, they'll leave nice dry and puffy clouds in the east; which, for whatever reason, bear the
                        lingering loud more than all the land around, and thus shine's whiter than you'd expect. As darkness
                        proceeds, there is little but a blue velvet in the sky, and a quaint grey in the west: night has come.
                        <br>&emsp;To those with a keen eye, there is still grandeur in this hidden time. For the moon,
                        explicitly,
                        lights the land in an equally nice way; showing mountains and distance more than you'd otherwise see.
                        "Which
                        makes it feel like were privy to the land while it sleeps." Otherwise, with no moon, the scenery is not
                        the
                        nights esteem. Rather, the sky, if open, is still visible; in either it's speckle of stars, or the
                        quietly
                        lit clouds. "Which add a great texture to the empty night." There is always light then, and only a
                        blanked
                        overcast can remove such; as it does during the day.

                        I am finely employed. I say this, as if to honor what may be true, that we are not so fufilled in this;
                        as,
                        our time alloted is relatively small.
                        <br>&emsp;It is not short of much which we'd do otherwise, but still not there.
                        <br>&emsp;We are given means for food though; and I care not for our room. But, like Jess, if we were
                        working much more, we'd still have the same fortune. Whether it be just, or by my content to stand by,
                        the
                        position remains.
                        <br>&emsp;In that state, we are calm and proceeding; coming and going to work, with relative ease. I
                        feel
                        the ware, and our bonds with other's is forever in motion; but our brace of strenght, aerobics and
                        breathing
                        is more or less secure; as is our food fairly strong. The latter though is still ironing itself out; but
                        mostly due to our alignment with the time of day.
                        <br>&emsp;No matter, I can relate, or at least compare, how some few months ago we were equally
                        pronounced
                        and well off; yet also missing, unsure, and with a mind for change. Now, we may be deemed to ill-just
                        and
                        asked to further our load; or we may make on, and only have our time to anwser to.
                        <br>&emsp;The weight behind me is something I feel when our proper procedure is off. For we are of some
                        mix
                        uncomposed, nor drawn. And so the lack of friends and goings feels like a tear; as does our mind get
                        caught
                        in the gruff of imagery. Our state has mended this though, by using our ripe time to currate some
                        postive
                        remarks, and by that, establish ourselves as properly seperate from those chimeras; but to also mend
                        their
                        nature, 'as to not see them, or believe them, as so fiery and tyrannical'. The nature of war has
                        loosened
                        her grip on me in this regards, as have our own modern risks. The notion that things unfamiliar enlarge
                        their proportions, 'of what seems good or awful'; and further so, if such thing is far away, by land or
                        memory. "Reading then brings us close, and we feel proper remorse and stability regarding what has
                        occured,
                        and might come." So much that we are elevated above needing to define it; as we can sit with the
                        actuality
                        in our mind, and not feel like it is to illusroy as not be warrant naughing it. "It used to feel like
                        there
                        was this loose thread beneath me. Now, albeit of an iron red and hot, so does our mind cool it; as a
                        perception at least."
                        <br>&emsp;I know, be it a minute or some furthe equivalent of a mile, I will feel idle, more than likely
                        stiff, and, in short, drawn to some point of comfort, a recession; for being still, free and simple,
                        will
                        feel bared upon by some crack in our circumstance, our some blurredness in the goods we otherwise see.
                        "From
                        within we'll collapse, from without, we are not held: and each bit of these motions is counterblanced by
                        something which can only be defined as vice: not becase of what they are, but what is observed in what
                        they
                        produce: they are not absent of where they came from, being the good, but rather detriments born in
                        response
                        to a lack of good: and however you look at it, these things, which are not themselves the good, in
                        principle
                        create something which is thus: and all the more likely, 'as our actions tend to carry themseles
                        immoderately, or at least outside of brief minutia', to ends which are clearly bad." I know this will
                        happen.
                        <br>&emsp;But I will say still, having the content and grace to still look on, 'even if in certain
                        vain',
                        that our ends are so more eligble and pure. Yet, in all things which these notions remark, there lacks a
                        real concept of practice and objective. For we see, in our moments of a finer type, what we'd like to
                        occur.
                        We wish to write, share ideas, expound our values and cares. And this has always seemed fine, as the
                        more we
                        knew of such matters, and flourished in resulting ways, 'our time of offering this seemed more secure'.
                        But
                        the actual progress of this has not come into a state which is more solid, 'and easily sprung forth
                        based on
                        the bounty I've established'. For one, we still have no ideas, nor really wish to. But the inquirie's
                        we've
                        made, whether in truth brilliant or amateurish, are not of much common value. Nor in our candor and
                        might,
                        is there room outside of the particular things your doing. "You are not nor will be king, nor are set
                        for
                        acclamtion and gain, based on who you purely are. You must perform, give, create." And such things are
                        more
                        or less absent of me.
                        <br>&emsp;Where were left then, is perhaps a true direction of peace. For in all our reflections, it
                        would
                        seem just and fair to admitt that our cares for fame and impact, only came based on our own shortcoming
                        of
                        ideas, 'and any of them which dealt with things of a frightening sort; the ill-clarity of which made it
                        harder to sit with, and thus compelled me to expound forth, as to remove the weight of such notions via
                        the
                        consquent effect of motion'. Instead, it seems that as our ideas align, or at least bud themselves into
                        a
                        calm and collected state, 'be it through further motion or serenity', that so are we more or less dealt
                        a
                        road which is not so foolishly motivated; a path which is born of pure direction, in that we can be set
                        and
                        betrothed to where we actual see a flourishing, rather than running, to cleanse our uneven insides.
                        <br>&emsp;But, of what I'd like, I do not know. And right to the point, there is armour I have, which
                        perhaps could be finely admitted in our lighter time. But right now, all I can say, is that alhtough our
                        moments feel limbre and dear, so is there a thinness to our depths; regarding our broader desires at
                        least.
                        For there is so much strenght which we have, and a meadow of cheer and gladness moated about; but not
                        much
                        of far off things, or times further. Were stuck in this barrated response, 'which our composure and
                        delight
                        was formed against'. What were responding to here, 'as if an learned response', is the armour. We ought
                        take
                        it off, or at least progress the truth. For I am in all ways fine, but with no real end. And of those
                        which
                        we don't consent to out of being merely common, so are these more weighing against. "For our absent of
                        travel for instance, although parlayed as some wonderful experience, is not so ladden upon me as having
                        children, a home, a marriage. Similarly, the virtue and or propiety in volunteer work, speaking up,
                        'caring
                        for those outside your nearby gaze', so does this feel woffted in the air; and by that, inflamatory to
                        our
                        otherwise imagined view of foreign things: details of which we have not thought of: but of that rightous
                        scent, so does it make me appeal to things which are otherwise improperly deemed. Like were spurred to
                        remark upon our imagination, and beckon to it as if it were real: which is indeed the cause of wearly
                        defining things, or bearing rancour."

                        So, looking over our morning routine, as if on a pure basis, there is a clear difference from planning
                        for
                        aerobics or not. If it is the former, we still act as though were not doing it, walking at least two
                        times,
                        then having some ruffage. This is fine sometimes, but can ware me out before even running. I have
                        experienced drawbacks from getting up and going for a run, but there ought be somewhere in between.
                        <br>&emsp;I think were underestimating how much our stretching leavens us out, as to only walk once,
                        then
                        run. Plus, our running is more along the lines of free range. And you may simply do that at home and
                        call
                        her a day. As you may wish to go to the park and read.
                        <br>&emsp;I think the issue is that we ought often want different things. We may be clambering to read;
                        and
                        if such, going out early is our goal; but thereby, we need less prior. There is a real effect from
                        walking,
                        and perhaps it is our body being in a worn or recovered state that limits how much we can do. But we can
                        act
                        properly throughout the day to mend what were compramising with. If you went for a walk, then came home,
                        stretched and went for a read and or run, then a solid walk after this would likely soothe us out. We
                        may
                        fruit after our first venture, then perhaps a smoothie, protein, energy. All I see is that as the
                        afternoon
                        sets in --following midday- that from there were back out, be it to the parks, the farms, or for chores
                        yet
                        to do. From here it's grain time, and likely two servings, leading into the blue hour.
                        <br>&emsp;It seems were set for a walk upon waking, with no ware on me, followed by one leading into
                        midday.
                        There is room for strolls and or novelty, based on interest, the short nature of these, and your
                        solidty.
                        But we can fit life in between; and not feel so worn if we do. For there is more through the day. And,
                        I've
                        found, that by exhibiting primary things, that your need to 'bolden yourself out' through the same kind
                        of
                        them is not neccessary. Walking bears me a easy breathe, a plump body and means to see. But this is an
                        exerting means, which forming motions can produce. These are moments during the day, when you stand
                        tall,
                        upright, breathe, fold and or hold, and this gives the rythm of your morning, afternoon, evening and
                        sleep a
                        secure foundation. Running does elevate you, but it also aims at giving you room to relax and breathe.
                        You
                        need not do it to keep you upright; it is what is done when you already are.
                        <br>&emsp;I don't wish to compartmentalize this, but merely adjust some our habits. For we've felt for
                        so
                        long that two walks was required before eating, reading, games or watching was allowed. But were going
                        out
                        now, to the park, for chores, or to read and what not. The point being, is that, if you have the right
                        form,
                        and retain the core benefit from your walks, aerobics and strenght, then you can angle these to account
                        for
                        your life. "Which, upon being set upon an overworked foundation, becomes a load upon that, or, from such
                        shaky foundation, is not so seen, and thus of less interest."
                        <br>&emsp;Writing is important to me, as is reading and games, stretching and the sun. But I also care
                        about
                        these, beyond there esscence upon me. This is my life; I form my time and deeds around it.

                        So we've had a relatively solid day. The morning was a bit embellished; which we've reflected on. But
                        going
                        out for a scoot prior to midday was so nice; sitting at industrie's edge, and reading Surgeon From
                        Belgium
                        --which has been lovely.
                        <br>&emsp;What's carrying my thought is this sense of stable rythm; where, if we sought to, we could eat
                        terribly, smoke, care nothing for work besides us going to it. And we'd be swell, making money, solid at
                        home. Just the idea that we are so well is pleasing to me. And all I mean for this entry, is to better
                        exclaim how we can live more fully amidst this rythm. As having more definite things to look forward to
                        makes our freedom a bearer to comfort. But concerning the shades of light and or weather, the right
                        amount
                        to stretch, eat and walk, while we leisure through, is less clear. "And not so benefited by having to
                        think
                        of it. You want to do well as not to burn out or fallow away; but also feel firm and ready to do as you
                        please; be it reading, writing, gaming or craft."
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, walking need not be this constant exertion, for we have yoga. Running may be done
                        as a
                        casing around milder aerobics --which can be done almost any day. The afternoon is the least pleasing
                        time,
                        and fits well as a point of routine and siesta; where we do our laundry, shower, jerk off, cook, and
                        then
                        rinse and sleep. We may also eat energy foods, such as smoothies, edamame or veg. And in multiple
                        servings.
                        A grand walk may lead into this, whereby our initial walk can lead into our training and or morning
                        ventures; followed then by another midday walk, which leavens us out for lunch and rest. "This is also a
                        great time for movies and shows, or real gaming. Leave Battlefield, baser writing and outdoor books for
                        your
                        the morning, and such venture."
                        <br>&emsp;The issue I am facing, or have seen today, is one of the evening. For the afternoon begins to
                        dip,
                        and the light begins to shine towards everything, giving a nice heat to the sky and land. This is a
                        great
                        time to go out. But the balance is that I assuredly wish to go out for the nautical dusk; at the very
                        least
                        mind you, as sunset is it's own missed grandeur. There's just so many moments to take pleasure in, nor a
                        clear expectation as to which scenery (beyond the sky's color) what will be prestine. Baker may be
                        fuzzed,
                        as may there be overcast towards the moutains. This morning for instance, the clouds were few yet puffy;
                        but
                        into the evening the fizzled out into a course haze. All in the east mind you, while the west was rather
                        clear, with definite whisps.

                        So the golden hour is akin to the blue hour, as a character'd view of time. In reality, there is early,
                        mid
                        and late morning, and the same for afternoon and evening. Mid morning is that time when the shadows are
                        deepening and the color is vibrant, but not to washed out as midday. While the mirror of this is mid
                        afternoon, though late afternoon has it's own manner of warmth. Evening begins as the sun prominently
                        sets,
                        into the golden hour and into twilight. Late evening though includes dusk.

                        So it seems perhaps that heavier training will always drain you; and place you in a state that wishes to
                        rest and londer. This is fine.
                        <br>&emsp;Going for one longer walk, stretching, then working out felt fine. But everything has been
                        reached
                        early. This is alright. The day is not so grand, and so there's no rush to go out there. We need to
                        shower;
                        jerk off, and if to porn, watch pornstars, or people with names at least; as this removes the illusion
                        that
                        ordinary people are doing this. There's a good smoothie coming, as well as corn, quinoa and lentils.
                        There's
                        great mini hashbrowsn, our bagels, cucumber and nuts.

                        I tend to shy away from strict sentiment. "You must have protein, be it tuna or edamame, following a
                        workout." But I also recognize that these things may be missed otherwise, and their kind of contribution
                        lost.
                        <br>&emsp;The issue though is how we usually go about our day. For I don't have this merry acceptance of
                        tuna, as it feels acidic; the form of it is light, compared to chicken, but only in the richest of
                        protein
                        needs do I care for it. Edamame is much lighter though, in acidity, but also not as anabolic. This is
                        fine
                        when you've done just a bit. But I also have a small aversion to eating so much, 'as if the soy is
                        somewhat
                        odd'. There is no clear alternative then. But, the point, is that you tend not to need such things
                        wholeheartedly; and if you do, then soy or tuna is welcomed. It would seem wise to consider bulk
                        purchasing,
                        so we know it's available. As right now, we buy a bag for 3$, and it has 2 big servings, or several
                        which
                        you mix with grain. Indeed, that is how you can furnish your general needs; as they become elevated
                        following prior sessions. "It's only when the session is clearly large, or your in a state where you
                        wish
                        for protein: as if you feel your store is low."
                        <br>&emsp;It seems then that if your just being active, or at best doing something aerobic, then you
                        might
                        have roughage in the morning, then a smoothie or two during the day. In fact, I find this, albeit beyond
                        neccessity, a great addition to our life. A smaller smoothie satiates me, and more or less nourishes me,
                        but
                        then, upon another, keeps me full for the midday; which is often the hardest point. As, going to late
                        afternoon, you may go on a post-rest/midday walk, and go out for a read, or to shop. And following this
                        your
                        likely to eat grains, and mozzy onto the evening.
                        <br>&emsp;These aspects feel clearer. And, unlike proteins, which I am more reluctant to be constant
                        with,
                        so is our smoothie, like an orange or peanut+kale, so good and clear, that I'm fine making it so
                        constant.

                        So there's a clear moment coming out of the morning, after noon, and some blend of evening, that holds
                        our
                        ventures for the day.
                        <br>&emsp;That we would walk, stretch, run and or train is one thing; as it is one thing for us to eat
                        veg,
                        fruit, smoothies or grain, and in which proportion.
                        <br>&emsp;In sinking into these though, we may firmly and happily move through our life; as the core of
                        it
                        is set, as are we doing something relatively good in itself. It's those dear linens which marble me, be
                        it
                        in books, gaming or craft. But it is upon our life which this flows.
                        <br>&emsp;Truly, I know not what the future holds. Our need for a child is more along the line's of
                        eventuality, and thus a woman for that. But, our choices have brought us away from where we've ever
                        been,
                        and as such, have dealt us little of connection. As we felt near the end of Vancouver, and are feeling
                        now,
                        that of our responsability, at least it's blending as a duty with your liberties, so must we maintain
                        ourselves in order to stand above this, 'and ride the current' so to speak. For what happens, is we
                        begin
                        something, and go through the motions of living in relation to it as a deed. But through initial
                        fortitude
                        and endurance through habit, we loose this sense of weight and any according apprehension. Seeing as
                        what we
                        bear is the means to live, so is our rythm with this one of just freedom: for what we see is on and from
                        right and stable grounds. Every time we move then and have to begin, we redo this process. And indeed,
                        the
                        fairest mistake I've made, 'where we almost succumb to the plea of weakness', was when we left
                        Superstore in
                        October 2020; for during that time, we had floated above our duty and we relatively well. But we felt
                        wrong
                        for being so content; and seeing as there was something we felt proper to see, of something at least, so
                        did
                        such sights become dreams, 'and procastinations for which we could leave work, then eventually work
                        for'.
                        <br>&emsp;I see now more than ever that a) we can and will rest above our endebted grounds, and b) find
                        a
                        sort of reason and strenght to flourish, which, through constancy and grace, we'll see things from such
                        point of where, 'from our content, as opposed to spiting it'.

                        There is a proper state which is so challenging to describe. It reflects a midway between the ultimate
                        development of time, and how your not so fordrawn to it, 'like those dreaming or yearning', nor so
                        quenched
                        and hidden, 'like those depressed, head down, unable to see ahead'.
                        <br>&emsp;The state were talking about is a flourishing, eudymonia, a burdenless delight. In this, we
                        are
                        above our tasks; making them thus deeds rather than burdens. "As, being duties, they fall to either
                        side."
                        <br>&emsp;I stand though with a little uncertainty of things. For the elements of a dream, or foresight
                        rather, need not reflect what one may experience in the present. The key example of this is our
                        education,
                        and how it aims at offering us a career, and a better one the longer we are educated; but without an end
                        is
                        this based, besides presumed matters. "We delight and align ourselves to our progress, only to reach a
                        point
                        which was not exactly the source of such good." There would be few mid-life crisis' if this weren't so,
                        nor
                        so much family fighting or contempt.
                        <br>&emsp;The point then, is that of our current strides, I see, from memory and its relation to our
                        present
                        actions, how such things are not so clear; as they are with respect to a future we once deemed. Writing
                        and
                        study shine brightly here, or obscurely rather; as I once saw them as the basis for some acclaimed and
                        generous project; but the form of this was never so clear, or at least it was taken for granted. Now, I
                        am
                        not so espoused to such dream; but the fact that were still writing leaves me somewhat unsure as to the
                        nature of this; and what it, in truth means. For in our far seeing ways, it is novel and or presumed
                        formations which bear our passion and intrigue. "Our ideas are held in us, and like a heartbeat, pace
                        away
                        by their excitable nature; but all formed and heralded by some assumed mold. Some foundation which we
                        feel
                        like will naturally do; yet we know little of this, and are merely carried by the nature of our
                        interests,
                        rather than the operation." The point though, is that of writing and study and all things of the sort, I
                        do
                        care. In fact, I am delighted by them further. "As the release of our dreaming yields me more freedom
                        and
                        cheer to do them more; as were neither waiting nor begrieved of our joy and content." But in this, I am
                        not
                        clear about what they mean at all. As if our presumptions, in being so clearly faulty when brought
                        close,
                        leaves me with little that is actually laudible; as our present solidity makes such things viewed under
                        such
                        calm and cheery ways. Our lack of knowledge then is only clear. And, for clarity's sake, this notion of
                        the
                        form, 'or way of operation', is merely an ember from our natural ebbs of imperfection; where we gently,
                        yet
                        slightly still, see, as remarks a mild comparison to a dream, what we are going to do ahead; and, within
                        that, the 'idea' or formation which reflects that. "It is as if we had bold views animated by our
                        excited
                        interests; yet upon rest, the boldness was shown to be hollow and vain. But our interests now, albeit
                        fine
                        and plenty while were flourishing, 'without the future, or problems of any sort, in sight', can be
                        sprung a
                        little into seeing further off, and thus binding to some formation. The milder nature of this excitement
                        and
                        or yearning makes for an accordingly mild form: but of this we don't even know. For in our bolder
                        sights,
                        the emptiness was not seen, and our elation overtook our sight of it's futility. While now, I see much
                        clearer; and it is that of even the smallest of dedications or ends, so don't we know." Which calls for
                        an
                        inquiry of the simplest of things.

                        The beauty of writing is that it acts like a budget, in that, of all the elements around you, 'be it
                        costs
                        or income', so can you survery the domain, and from there, more steadily and effectively judge and or
                        amend.
                        <br>&emsp;Life is no different. As so much comes to us; and much of what we accept, or may, is born from
                        the
                        past, and not taken notice by me. Which surely leads to ends offered by such means; but not neccesarily
                        one's we cared about. For we may be young and solid, but only because we are doing what we perceive to
                        be
                        right; and enjoying ourselves do to such stability; only to then reach the end, and find that it is not
                        one
                        which we terribly enjoy. Or, better yet, of all the other things we cared for, 'in our young and free
                        going
                        way', that so were these ill-fit for the deeper end we reached.
                        <br>&emsp;The point is, that writing, as a mode of reflection and inquiry, allows for all things to be
                        dealt
                        with; and rather simply due to the written nature, as you can speak of one thing, then speak from there;
                        whereas in normal conversations, it is hard to build off of old points.
                        <br>&emsp;In that, I can see where things are off, and address them. This is so, for our choices have
                        not
                        brought us to an occupied point, or one with much fun. There is merely peace and joy. Yet this state is
                        not
                        always filled out, and so the world can bear upon us. This is so, for there is much around us in the way
                        of
                        suggestion and idea, and our more idle states get sapped up by these, 'and like a blanker canvas,
                        saturated'.
                        <br>&emsp;What I've noticed is that, compared to your reasons about life's many troubles, 'and upon
                        them,
                        having some sense prior made as to bring you back to harmony', that so in your studies can you better
                        hear
                        and let go of random impressions or information. We may not be so susceptible to these, in that we are
                        with
                        more action. But so is this a weary line; for we may be fine, or at least in need of rest, and thus more
                        prone to babbles and authority. "Hereby, lies those idle dreams; as compares to exhaustive effots, which
                        will us to move; while these dreams give us some sort of occupation, or cease to indolence, but through
                        the
                        clarity of the road ahead; giving us more solidity to our point on it now."

                        I submitt that our life's aim is a farce. For fortune has gifted me with the riches of simplcity; the
                        goods
                        which, in receding from the 'want of more', were so much inherently, that I could do little to meet
                        them.
                        Amidst such breadth, there sat peace: we were well and full, but with ease and senility: no effort, or
                        grough rather, for this bounty worthy of kings.
                        <br>&emsp;But it is in those motion, whose motivations are a subject of their own --to recede and
                        accept--
                        that our futility lay. For in this lane, all smooth and lovely, there sat in me a sort of impression.
                        One in
                        which the world seemed so plain, breezy and fine. So much so, that we bent our recession towards this;
                        as we
                        had no doubts of the good which was free for the taking; and thus, our satiety by merely existing was
                        clearly so, that we were fine to remove our ambition, relish the abscence of duty and deed, and be fine
                        with
                        the plenty given.
                        <br>&emsp;I will state, as if the insight to this inquiry, that this mode of being, of recession, has
                        not
                        been, nor feels so rightly set, for stability. Accepting that, as I waiver here or there, 'without much
                        besides that inherent given', so do we feel drawn to things beyond: from where we've receded from. Only,
                        of
                        that which animates this motion, 'be it for promise or passion', it comes from the sights we so steadily
                        see. "For in our recession, and it's ebbs and flows into full and or lacking satiety, of the things
                        which we
                        generally see in those moments of peace, so do these become the forms and matter by which our further
                        regards are based on." If there is a world out there, full of fun and oppertuntiy, 'which our receded
                        postion may yearn for', then of that world and all our potential actions for it, so are they colored and
                        baked in the proportions sprung from our receded position.

                        So about 7:00, the sun dips to two units ahead. A unit is essentially a point in which, if you sat, it
                        would
                        move a unit's amount. From sunset up is one 1 unit, and around 7 it was 2 units away. Prior to this, the
                        light is rather cool and unremarkable. There is a point around 4 that is warm, soft and rather deep. The
                        units between that and the 2 up from sunset is the point where rest, dinner and play are best. There is,
                        to
                        be fair, a point during the day, leading into that warmer part of the afternoon that is also fair for
                        this.
                        But, I will admitt, that even the midday can be nice. To a degree, it come's down to atmosphere; as
                        there
                        being some washes out the light, making the midday poor. As of now, 740 is the stretch, or unit, of
                        sunset.
                        It is not hard to see, how following this is a cooled unit, which begins to blossom with color, 'upon
                        mountain and cloud'. From there, another unit of darkening and blues, and sole remaining highlights on
                        clouds, to a final unit of the deepest sorts.
                        <br>&emsp;As a quick reflection, if the sun is low, so will the shadows be long. As will the highlights
                        be
                        warmer, 'as the atmosphere spreads blue light, leaving only warmer yellows and oranges'. Contrast then
                        is
                        when there is a difference between shadow and highlight.
                        <br>&emsp;For our health, we ought attend to strenght training with proper care. This means walks,
                        eating
                        and stretching which respect it. While mere free range or light running can be accomodate by normal
                        procedure.
                        <br>&emsp;It is obvious to me that our willfull motions are solid, but that, when our will is gone,
                        'upon
                        weary and or tightening exertions', so do we need a guide; as this helps our breathing, and also our
                        focus.
                        For this, we ought finish our YWA, for standing, brief and long, something with warrior, another for
                        lifts,
                        and one for rest and rinsing. These will do fine: and fit nicely with our already ample norms.
                        <br>&emsp;Food wise, we are best to enstate foods which are constant, and thus warrant our indefinite
                        regard
                        and collection. Oranges are a fresh example, as is kale, peanuts and tomatoes. Avocadoes for instace are
                        nice, and subsitute well with tomatoes; but are not a constant. I've decided this so. What I have
                        choosen is
                        smoothies. As drinking one big one is not as useful or beneficial; as it wares on me more, and leaves me
                        hungry sooner. The base of this though, is that smoothies, in smaller portions, ought be had throughout
                        the
                        day, as with oranges. For this, we need a consistent supply of flax, which is easy, bananas, which can
                        be
                        easy, though require private storage, milk, which alongside berries is the main expense, and then kale;
                        which, although easy, ought be bought in plenty as to allow you to freeze ample amounts. "The key thing
                        for
                        a constant is to never wonder or doubt whether you can have it."

                        So, seeing the day, it seems that from the point that the sun is near setting, to the point in which the
                        deep blue is last to be seen, is about 1 hour. I note that there is a point in which you ought be
                        present,
                        for it makes no sense to state when things are about to slip away.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, it seems there is about 15 minutes where the sun has set and all is dull; and then
                        the
                        lingering reds and oranges seep in. From there, another 15 goes by and the first of the deep blues sinks
                        in,
                        along with the creamy oranges in the west. It is 15 minutes from here that the cream begins to sink, and
                        the
                        sky becomes its deepest blue.
                        <br>&emsp;In this sense, one could go 15 minutes prior to sunset, leave, then go out for the red, stay
                        for
                        15 minutes to see the early blues, and wait another to see the deep blue. I admitt that we fail to make
                        use
                        of our privalage, that we have a yard that looks upon the light. In that though, you could balance each
                        point. Indeed, our estimates may be off; though I don't think the time of year alters the rythm of sun
                        to
                        dark. But, when the reds come in following the set is unclear; as does the atmospher play a solid part.
                        As a
                        thikcer one makes the early blues less appealling; despite the horizon holding similar colors. The deep
                        blue
                        is good no matter though.
                        <br>&emsp;To bind this together, if there is lingering reds, be it from the light or the clouds, then
                        early
                        twilight is of worth. Near the end of twilight, the blue's become darker then their color can address,
                        nor
                        is there much but lingering white light in the west. What we want, is that lingering warmth along with
                        the
                        darker shades of blue. This marks the middpoint, where that less vibrant part begins, and the blues and
                        lingering reds remain; into the black. While the initial part is of the red sky; which is to say, that
                        if
                        there is something that may catch the beginnings of twilight, then note this; and if note, upon the
                        abscence
                        of light, yet lingering color, this begins cream of twilight.

                        I have an odd reflection. Seemingly, when we were younger, we got cramped down by duty, and responded by
                        being merely sufficient, and pleased by comfort. We strove for nothing beyond this.
                        <br>&emsp;I am a man of comfort it would seem. But we are also someone who does not like hard work.
                        Nothing
                        of the sort. But it is so, that for cars, clothes, vacations and or lavishes, you need money; and thus
                        need
                        to work hard.
                        <br>&emsp;I just always found much more good in the simple things of life. But oddly, there is a
                        contradiction in our approach. For when girls and vanity were in our sight, we felt poor and hid away.
                        While, at some points, we found good elsewhere. In highschool though, for instance, there seemed not
                        said
                        elsewhere; and so we were always amongst the shadows.
                        <br>&emsp;I would say this was caused by our choice to move, as we had no person to find that wholer fun
                        with; and so the immediate prescence of duty sunk into me, 'as there was nothing else for me to do'.
                        <br>&emsp;I think the worthwhile point is one of effort, or task, and the good that follows. For if
                        there is
                        much duty, 'of norms of self deemed', then your good may come from the peace in that, and the goods
                        harmonious with it. Whereas, a lack of duty, as when we have children, or even now when we are at home
                        and
                        quite beyond the feeling of stress, we seek more pleasure and fun. "As there is less sense of
                        consqeunce."
                        Of course sugar and comfort is good; but they're careless, or fitting for such, by nature.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I am a little unclear is the matters of sex, infamy and thrills. Partying, cars, fun
                        trips,
                        these are an odd appointment. For they come through lucrative means; but of their motivation, I am not
                        sure.
                        Are they a result of doing well, be it born of stress or genuine care? Or are they born of fear, 'as if
                        one
                        could not be pleased with simplicity, and thus were unfufilled and or insecure without bolder kinds of
                        fun,
                        and status'.
                        <br>&emsp;What I notice, and how this ties back to our youth, is that not all people are alike, in their
                        interests and desire. What we value and or are tasked to do, 'as bade by our rearing', also differs, and
                        so
                        our motivations may lean similar to those with such roots. But I see, that if it is a certain kind of
                        fun or
                        comfort, that there are people also seeking that. This is why our choice of moving has been so harsh on
                        us;
                        as those who would have been potential friends for me were not near me enough to procure so. But I see,
                        and
                        believe, that be it of peace and joy, or fun and full comfort, that there are women, men, allies of the
                        sort, who may find harmony with you.

                        I see a whole balance and blend, as regards our interests and reserve. It comes down to how you are, how
                        things are, what is asked upon you, whether to believe it or not. Cirumstance alters this, 'as you may
                        go
                        from a point which was well comforted and stable, to one which holds less, and perhaps asks even more:
                        to
                        which you alter'.
                        <br>&emsp;It is plain that without much duty, you'll find joy in comfort; and without much reserve. You
                        will
                        recgonize that there are some duties, be it in sports or chores; along with your common attendances. But
                        of
                        what you have to do, so can you dine and delight upon finishing.
                        <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to much of luxury and such, but it does feel to me a bit far off from
                        responsability; and I don't prefer the stark differnce

                        For whicever reason, the state were in, or ease of duty, alters my sense of right and wrong, and what is
                        to
                        be desired. For if we were like a kid, I'd say our duty was low, and that we could embellish from there.
                        The
                        truth though, is that we may live like that by our own means. The bar is a bit higher; but I contend,
                        upon
                        leaving Vancouver, that we had just reached over it. And right now, I can see how working not much more
                        than
                        we do right now would be sufficeint; and completly.
                        <br>&emsp;I think where my life has eroded, is in our wish to be our strongest self; for in that, the
                        experience I seek, of action, is brought forward the most. I don't believe that we must be passive to be
                        friends with many people; or amongst many. But I do feel like your place with them is best tempered, 'as
                        to
                        be a member'. By my counts, the deeper, meaningfull conversations, or interactions around people is what
                        is
                        pleasing to me. I don't wish to be impartial amongst a mass of folk; and being around so many tends to
                        do
                        this. Or I just wish to leave.
                        <br>&emsp;If someone said, 'you may have a kid, but must work for them indeterminately, or you may never
                        have one'; I think I would lean to the latter. Never in my childhood or youth have I ever thought of
                        such
                        things, in a desirous sense. Nor in my adult age have I held much interest. Regarding this, and marriage
                        and
                        a home espeicallly, all I saw was a massive undertaking. And I still maintain that considering our dear
                        interests, and their close nature, that of the simplicity needed for this, that so is our child an
                        extension
                        ontop of that; and of a similar principle, in that they are not bound for things beyond ourself. I need
                        little, and so will they.
                        <br>&emsp;From this, I lean on the simplicity which we have found; be it at home or on our own; we may
                        elevate above this, and stabily flourish. I admitt there were fears and rot desires beneath me

                        So I can speak to me life as it is, but my aim is to speak about what it could be, ought be, how I'd
                        like
                        it.
                        <br>&emsp;I think people make the mistake of looking far ahead; or better yet, finding obejcts which
                        they'd
                        like. "As if it were some buffee, and you selected this or that point."
                        <br>&emsp;I prefer to give our life some strucutre based on how it's been; and considering what we've
                        learned, how to implement that, and by that, remark our direction. For that is all anyone seeks, to be
                        set
                        and bounded; for all things leisure and rest come fairly then.
                        <br>&emsp;Foremost of my insights is that we ought not so callously leave. For we must find ourselves
                        anew,
                        and in turn, leave that which had been developed. Being here in Pitt Meadows, I see much promise and
                        delight. The position is solid, and one which is a lighter kind of simplicity. There are people at work
                        as
                        well as fair priced yoga to go to. All things far and abound, as I see it, come to know more fruition if
                        you
                        are here or somewhere else. "And so the big city is not so especially fine."
                        <br>&emsp;When I think of my life, I see a stream of marvel movies, some income to spend on newer games;
                        nor
                        any lacking when it comes to backlogs or classics. My studies remain pointed, as are our scenic
                        learnings a
                        bit broader then they were for much time ago. Our health is in balance, and of the ways we can improve,
                        so
                        is this relatively clear and deliberate, or sprouting through time. Food is always tricky; for I am
                        somewhat
                        begrieved to lack the friends and fun that give me ease to indulge. But there is still plenty of satiety
                        in
                        the wholer foods. And, honestly, my biggest complaint regarding such, is the inconstancy in which we
                        eat.
                        For I end up being hungry and whithered. We knwo that oranges, kale and nuts are a staple; as are
                        smoothies.
                        If money was tight, banans would still be fine, paired with cranberries and roughage. Grains remain
                        true,
                        though the lack of sugar brings with it less to look forward to; along with take out food. Popcorn,
                        potatoes
                        and bread remain satisfying, but only as they come; rather than on approach.
                        <br>&emsp;This is our life. None of it remarks something large or bound ahead; or anything stretching
                        the
                        distance. But it is hear, and considering our rythm with work and home, so do these things fill our
                        current
                        set. That's how I see it. There is room to inquire and reflect about the mountains and sky. As do I
                        continue
                        to plunder the peace from reading. Our writing patters on too. Our days could be more even; as we do
                        have
                        things to do; and when they are done, more will more than likely come. And so, when we are upon an
                        attendance, then our balance of inside, on the porch, walking, scootering and or seeing around, can be
                        more
                        quiet; and not so forced out as can occur. Let us use the littlest of things to make our day special,
                        and
                        retain our openess as to bring more life in. Be it Yoga, playing Minecraft with Tristan; or our more
                        tastefull use of porn. There is room for me to be, if we exist in the limit of exhibiting so
                        immediatley.
                        "At least, not with a care for abscence, as our simplciity can permitt. Not with too much haste, as to
                        finish things, but to work on them, and let them become done. We can find pleasure and goods around
                        this;
                        and upon a dip, even out, move as this quite time affords you, or spurrs you at least: and more interest
                        will come."
                        <br>&emsp;We may reflect and or experience more in the time; and be it near or far, or by reason and
                        gait,
                        see more.

                        One of the oddities of simplicity, is that it often comes through various forms. One may need 10$ worth
                        of
                        things, and we'll say this is a little amount; and they may have 20. And so their of excess, but not
                        with a
                        need for it; they may spend a bit more, for some extra fruit here or there. But one with the same needs,
                        but
                        only holding that amount, is equally satiated, but perhaps lacks any fair room for sprinkles and icing
                        around. Other folk may fall short of what they need, only having 8 or 9. They too lack sprinkles, but
                        also a
                        means for content regarding their means.
                        <br>&emsp;Right now, if we have room for sprinkles, then we ought use it. My hesitance to this is that
                        we
                        are living outside our means, and in some way, loosing strenght upon a situation that was not so
                        fruitfell.
                        Concilliating this is bearing me trouble.
                        <br>&emsp;My experience upon meeting our needs, is that there is never much struggle in doing so. That,
                        and
                        you may find room for frugal delights, giving the same feeling of excess. Moreover, if we are at a
                        certain
                        level, be it sufficeint or not, then our actions are only more clear; for they cannot go elsewhere. And
                        the
                        task, or at least slant of our amends, is one of acceptence and humility. For we may wish for more, and
                        work
                        for that as such; or let fortune bear her place. But we may also delight in what we have, and as it out
                        of
                        strenght, find more grace and composure in our level'd simplciity. Whereas now, where we are stable and
                        fine, yet with some excess, might we actually use that. It would be poor form if your use was
                        inpractical,
                        in that it removed you from your neccessities, 'causing a raise of it'. And equally, to your manor of
                        living. For simplicity relishes the acitivty which it is given room and time to indulge in. "If a saint
                        is
                        given a fortune, he may use it; but not to the extent that it erodes his sainthood."

                        I believe we underestimat the requirments when it comes to working out.
                        <br>&emsp;For starters, we work out by natural circumstance. For our muscles are made and happy to be
                        moving, under some sort of load, periodically at least. And our modern, if not contemporary ways, are
                        such
                        as to require less of us; in that we sit on soft sofas, softer beds, and otherwise lift little less were
                        employed to do so; and if we do, the motions are more naughing and full of garulity, rather than an
                        primitve
                        motions such as walking far, running quick.
                        <br>&emsp;And so, of our life and it's way, we address the fact that our muscles, in being what they
                        are,
                        are served by the motions we do; and on the balance of it, so do we make up for this in arbitary ways
                        ---based on the manner in which it's lacking.
                        <br>&emsp;There are two points of working out: form and tender. The tension of your muscles, firmnes and
                        or
                        strenght, comes from doing anything under load. Running achieves this nicely, as will your employments
                        do
                        this. This differs from though, in that this is about certain motions done repetitively, such as puhsups
                        or
                        squats. These aim at forming your muscles as correspond to certain kinds of movements: leg or hip
                        extension,
                        torso flexion etc.
                        <br>&emsp;Generally, if your doing some sort of loaded movement, and your body is more or less firm,
                        then
                        you'll want protein, water and food. If your form is put under load, this requires stretching, as your
                        resting position can bend you awkwardly; especially if your motions are stiffer, causes more contrast.
                        If it
                        is mere gusto you've produced, then simply recovery will do; as you haven't pushed yourself particular
                        motions, 'which ought be ironed out, as to sit naturally with you', nor is your jerkiness through work
                        (for
                        instance an issue), as the motionsare by nature unconctrated, and only the more systematicaly fatiguing,
                        rather than struutrally forming. By this, resting the muscles and returnig to neutral stance is
                        sufficient.
                        <br>&emsp;In any case, the point is that there is much to deal with if your doing the formative motions.
                        I'd
                        add, as I ought to have before, that we do such things for the composure it bears. At any rate, what we
                        do
                        upon such training is what we've been underestimating, in namely the amount of protein required, the
                        formative recovery, and general rest and ease which such efforts bring. For we sit on the floor for the
                        gain
                        of constant and breezy firmness. But, via our employment and lack of vitality when it come's to
                        formative
                        strenght, our motions there can be a bit lugging; by the nature of being so firm all the time, 'however
                        naturally plump and soft', that even if our workouts were equally light and hearty, so would our
                        everyday
                        nature on the floor require definite 'incorpative effort'. For we bundle up, bear down, and loose the
                        rigor
                        which we seek.
                        <br>&emsp;In this regard, what we need is to respect the amount of work were doing. Beginning with a
                        proper
                        sense of how much you've done; be it overall, or following a single session. You know, in the latter's
                        case,
                        that you need to eat your fruit and energy sooner than later. That, and you need to do some sort of
                        stretch;
                        be it chest, shoulders, twists, lifts (for elongation). The issue is not so much that you'd work on
                        something, or play something, or gander about; but that you'd forog those important measures; and
                        sometimes,
                        at the detriment of those others things, who upon such forgoance, weighs you down even more. "As things
                        don't sink in properly." Plus, if you consider how you are in general, which in combination with work,
                        recent sessions, and how you've progressed over the recent time, you may feel need for more naps, more
                        protein, fruit, recovery, some project to finish, a need of decompressing and or relief. Just have this
                        broader sense

                        I do not know where this reserve of mine lasts. For it is not so much a call to duty, which I whole
                        heartedly amend and superced; but something which says, 'do this, and you 'll feel free, for there will
                        be
                        nothing left to do: and leisure is your claim'.
                        <br>&emsp;This is the difference; not a hurdle in the way of something, but something to simply step
                        above,
                        as not to feel; and by virtue of the reason of such task, earn a just stability, of having overcome: and
                        completed it, while feeling little: to which, of the good it provides, 'for which the reason it is made
                        on',
                        so are you given, upon having received what you partook in, and thus, through such stability, 'of whihc
                        you
                        feel the weight no more', you happily see. This is the path of liberty, fecundity and grace. Worth a
                        god's
                        fate.
                        <br>&emsp;OUr issue, as a man, whos been a boy, and not stopped being so, is how we live outside this
                        primary path. For we may hide our motives and cares, or feel drawn to far off things; which may not be
                        bad
                        in themselves, but from our squirming point of view, are not so good for me: as I don't rightly seek it.
                        "And I fetter so much, because we always bear more upon that line of stability: yet find it even harder
                        to
                        be open: as the truth is ever so hard to explain." I've noticed though, as I actually live well, 'by the
                        effect of accepting this path, and ceasing the wants and fears', that we find it much clearer and simple
                        to
                        share, and thus be open. "To whits and ends seperate of our ways, but congruent, as plain things are: or
                        maybe connection of said points. Both may be."

                        The ocean of my mind seems to have more water now; and the waves are only the larger. Unlike before,
                        where
                        our esscence was rather compact, 'and noticeable of small cracks', now the tides wash right over it.
                        This
                        does not remove it mind you, 'but we've enough natural momentum to flow past it, and onto something
                        else'.
                        <br>&emsp;Ironically, we have had some pizza and chocolate, and so our sights on things is a bit hazed.
                        <br>&emsp;But I recognize in my heart, that what I care about is eating well, exercising right, the
                        language
                        arts, and the outdoors. I've always loved gaming and playing with friends; and movies, and as of late
                        youtube, is a general delight.
                        <br>&emsp;This kind of life though flourishes on it's ability to partake in things. And thus, even with
                        less
                        room for expenditure, a laborous job is more ideal. Especially when it is one where you work on a team.
                        <br>&emsp;Now, some labor is more preferable than others; for me at least, as one who means to be active
                        outside of work. In simplest terms, there is smooth and jerky labor; one reflecting construction like
                        jobs,
                        the other, personal shopping. A cashier for instance is it's own sort, or at least has it's own
                        properties;
                        unqiue as most. But, in more similar terms, is a produce associate, or clerk, who spend their time
                        working
                        with others, moving around; but admittedly with a bit of jerk.
                        <br>&emsp;Personal shopping may simply be a contemporary advent; and if it weren't here, I'm sure we'd
                        find
                        something else. But for now, as it is common place, 'as cashiers once became', that so are we inclined
                        to
                        work there.
                        <br>&emsp;We have full autonomy when it comes to this decision. If there is a war, however likely or
                        not,
                        then my current position will be of a civilian. If I am called, I may keep reserved, and offer to help
                        with
                        something else. If conscription comes to pass, so be it. We'll lay down our lives and die. Perhpas,
                        through
                        potential gluttony and pain, we'll cherrish and prostrate those bound to something similar.
                        <br>&emsp;Economically, we are all on our own. And we may be well off and fortuned, 'or set at the back
                        of
                        the pack'. What we value though is for us to decide; or at least accept. For me, I place much of my
                        worth in
                        things, and our according means to them, through a principle lens; one which sees no abscence of fortune
                        or
                        oppertunity as a slight upon me; even if there is: as we are fine with little as it is.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, economics reflects the limit of good in our lives. While war sparks the possibility
                        of
                        bad. "There may be crime and illness in our common lives, but so is war an investement of pestulance, as
                        for
                        better grounds to come anew." If this is our end, so be it; we'll partake in it as we must do. If not,
                        then
                        my duty is to myself, my family, and those I attend to.
                        <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to the nature of a constitution, the legacy of streets and bread, and the way
                        our
                        culutre is alike. So I do not know the reason or place there is for one to be so publicly invovled. Even
                        if
                        they helped them through whichever state the world was, so is such education for economics; or for the
                        various accounts of our lives.
                        <br>&emsp;This is from me though, and not something which is fostered upon me as something neccessary.
                        "Mos
                        of what I've heard, or percieved to been said( to me), is in regards to the improvement I can make for
                        myself." As it comes to children, most advice seems banked on that. But I desire this little. We are
                        already
                        so filled by life and it's grandeur. I do want more, 'be it in a good mind or not', but it is simply
                        broader, in education, ideas, curiosity, generous fun. A child feels like a compact diamond. I already
                        have
                        a pearl inside, and thus care only for the ocean of gold around. "For that diamond requires strict
                        concentration, in love and mining. In bearing it at least."
                        <br>&emsp;These thoughts are mine, as are our sympathies, 'as we ponder over a dense or broad way of
                        living:
                        but of me not less'. The life I am living and care for, is one of creation, one which the sun is
                        gratefull
                        for shining, 'as she feels seen'; and to all her neighbourly delights. The strenght in this way is one
                        of
                        real admission, 'that the goods we seek, in local wonders or far off love', require the same manner of
                        committment and practice as other paths of life would. Only, we mellow a bit in this form of life, as it
                        is
                        our own. And only from our sinking into it, have we accepted the peace in this, 'and color around',
                        along
                        with the whisps of wind born of lands far and around; the sort of scents and hazy imagery that sees me
                        settled and kept, but also cheerfull and delight as to whats to come. "Across the sea lies a place for
                        me,
                        to further be; not somewhere for committment, but for our current resolve to blossom."

                        I'd like to describe experience as a sort of sphere; the surface area of it at leasat, where there are
                        splotches and strands of color, and also roughness, 'like the top of the sea'.
                        <br>&emsp;Why I don't like certain foods, certain tv shows, certain media and or consumption, is that it
                        blocks out certain parts of the sphere. When it comes to evil things, 'like amputation and butchery',
                        all I
                        see are those harsh reds, 'and the rough and tumbly mountains'; but I loose sight of the man or woman
                        experiencing such. "The indian ocean of their heart is gone." Equally, in fine things, or pleasing one's

                        fortunate enough not to be at war, or in a time where such a thing is so common. But then even, if the
                        gods
                        willeth, I may still die happily. Grimly, sure; but to equal ends, as if I weren't. "A sentiment which
                        evens
                        us out with kings, and all those fortunate."

                        So we've been given this assignment: speak to the months and years ahead.
                        <br>&emsp;For starters, the further we look out, the more of an aim I need. Of this, I don't have. I
                        want
                        children, but don't desire them. "Eventually, we'll say, but nothing more." I care little for a house,
                        have
                        no genuine care for travel. And, as regards children, as certain as I'd need more (in income, to
                        provide),
                        that so is this threshold relative to me and my simple standards. Whatever this amounts to, I cannot
                        say.
                        But I'd say it's years down the line, and the stakes are (to me) moderate. "I mean to raise someone to
                        live
                        well; and this does not require as much money as is needed to be more well off." So I have no
                        apprehension
                        about this down the line.
                        <br>&emsp;I say this, because my interests now are not in the way that a career is. As that is a sort of
                        mean, 'a profession, or basis for further income, to acquire things, or do what you like'. Little of
                        what I
                        care for benefits from this. And even if it does, 'as I would find much pleasure in seeing the wilds of
                        India', so is this expensive, and as such, demanding of my time to afford it. "I would love to be King
                        of
                        England; but considering the amount of effort, I don't care enough for the reward." Plus, the nature of
                        my
                        interests, which can be summized into gaming, writing and the outdoors, is that nearly all forms of work
                        take away from my ability to engage with them. So far as my cares are of concern, and I have no desire
                        nor
                        apprehension about the future to come, then the simplest means to live is what I seek. If I had no need
                        for
                        anything, 'and had some innate means for home and bread', I'd still employ myself; as being around
                        people
                        has it's own benefits and comfort. Little more.
                        <br>&emsp;On that note, be it for interest or preperation, the kind of jobs/careers I'd apply myself
                        towards
                        is slanted away from non-social positions. I see the benefit of working from home, but it give's you no
                        collegues or friends. My feelings will change about this as time goes on, but right now, considering the
                        long time I spent alone (before moving), being around other's seems preferable, if not essential.
                        <br>&emsp;I say all of this, because, whether I was given something from you or some other fortune, I'd
                        use
                        it. But not for any meaningfull end. I'd vacation, relax and explore; but the point I'm at now, aimless
                        and
                        pondering, would still be reached. So I don't long for you or anyone to give me anything. It would just
                        be
                        temporary pleasantry.
                        <br>&emsp;Practically, I mean to stay for at least 6 months (as you put it). I can imagine staying
                        longer,
                        perhaps 2 years. But I'd imagine by that point an urge to move would start simmering. I mean to stay at
                        Superstore throughout this time; and whether you moved or I did, I'd give some thought to staying in
                        Ridge/Pitt, and remaining at Superstore.
                        <br>&emsp;Vancouver always felt like a dream, because it offered a seemingly easier route to the things
                        I
                        longed for. Girls, friends, recognition. But I know now, clearly, that these things come purely from
                        your
                        own actions; and simple ones at that. Moreso, these actions are not limited by any location; nor that
                        benefited from any. There are more people in Vancouver, as are there more buisnesses and things going
                        on.
                        But if I do little, it won't matter. And I am finding that if I do even little, that this is enough: and
                        all
                        places (including Pitt Meadows) are then suitable.
                        <br>&emsp;I can say, with great purpose, that I mean to do better, as a person, and perhaps, a man. I
                        wish
                        to recycle; learn how and why, and share this with others. I want to be more involved publicly: which
                        being
                        on Twitter or Facebook in any meeaningfull sense is. Be it for pleasure or purpose, I love video --of
                        the
                        youtube sort. And I would like to use such means/platform to speak about the things I care about
                        ---about
                        the games I love, or the world.

                        This has been my genuine interest for the recent years. But a mix of ignorance and procastination has
                        held
                        me back. I have a mountain of heart and substance, and my skills have gone through various tests; but
                        the
                        idea of starting goes beyond me. In part, because I know what it takes.
                        <br>&emsp;$$$$But also, because my deepest care for these things is not zeal or 'childish idealism'; but
                        real and genuine care. "Something I'd be pleased with, even if no one heard or saw. The very act of
                        trying
                        would be enough." But of what is enough, so do I have old thoughts and excuses regarding the need for
                        success,'and how the attempt we'd make would not yield us such'. This lowers our excitment, and makes me
                        feel isolated: as I imagine that no one cares about what were doing, or even condemns me for it.
                        <br>&emsp;"Get a real job!" is the sentiment I hear --within my angst.

                        I say all of this, because there is one clear truth: if I am well, happy and pleased, then I care not if
                        my
                        aims are promising, or that exciting. I can just do them out of our care and interest, and not feel like
                        we
                        have to prove anything; or that it has to literally change the world. I just want to be better --in an
                        active sense. But what I'd define that as, and imagine it to be in the sense of production and
                        creativity,
                        is genuinely large. As I have so many cares and delights, so much insight and knowledge, so much value
                        and
                        reverence for things. "An enormity to share."

                        $$$The honest truth, is that I believe that people are their own entities, and experience things in ways
                        that we more often than not pithily imagine. "We know so little aboout ourselves, yet we claim to
                        understand
                        people: and grossly praise or pillary them."
                        <br>&emsp;What I lack is happiness; and it is because I am not living right, full or anything truly. And
                        it
                        is not the effects upon others which I care about; but that we are acting well, behaving kindly, and not
                        so
                        juvenile or passive. "If I were otherwise, I'd have nothing to say; and my note would be a mere account
                        of
                        all the good I wish to continue. But there is in fact that part of me which is young, dumb and not
                        living. I
                        wish to rid this gross feeling it gives me: and all the arrogance and stupidity which it conjurs, 'as if
                        some defensive mechanism or assertion to deal with such !!!!!grundge'. I don't believe my lies anymore,
                        when
                        I say that I am actually well. There is so much more I could do, so much happiness to gleam. But it is
                        not
                        about where I go or what I recieve, but how I'm being."
                        <br>&emsp;Personally, I am pretty swell in these regards, flourishing even. But the world gets spat upon
                        me
                        sometimes. Fairly, but also crumbily, 'through the press and tv'. And I can't help but feel right and
                        pleased to attend to that. At the very least, my inner happiness, 'in all its fun and wholesome
                        strides',
                        would reach farther. In those bounds and all the strenght needed, is what I am talking about, and feel
                        mentally cloitered and repressed

                        So this may be obsucre, but considering what I wrote intially, I'm confident this will lead to something
                        clear.
                        <br>&emsp;I find, whether I'm writing to you, or myself even, that I always end up trying to
                        explain/justrfiy why being happy is important. Having things or going places does not define this for
                        me,
                        but how you actually spend your time; how you live.
                        <br>&emsp;The issue, is that living is hard. It is not brought on by the removal of problems; this only
                        gives free time. You have to then use it; nor are things of much worth withotu their own preperations.
                        "You
                        must learn to paint before you can do it, even if your free to do so."
                        <br>&emsp;There's two sides of my life then: my dear cares, and my broader efforts in the world. The
                        former
                        amounts to gaming, writing and the outdoors. The latter is best summized like this (as a general
                        example: I
                        wish to recycle more, learn why and how, and share with people my committment to this, and also educate
                        them
                        as to why and how they can similarly act. Describing the motive for this, to be a good citizen, to help
                        others, to be more invovled in the world, is nothing but a medley of rightousness, passion and fear.
                        There
                        is interest though; as a science teacher may find.
                        <br>&emsp;Beyond my common living and cares, my broader interests lie in this.

                        lies in the resolve to inquiry; and, in maintinag composure amidst words and suggestio, ought you know
                        enough to be so undecided, yet above said words."
                        <br>&emsp;For me, this route is upheld by nothing but our view of it, and the small measures that
                        faciliate
                        movement. A man may do as he please; and by that, progress as he would. For me, sitting on the floor is
                        the
                        most vitalizing choice he can make. But so must he properly amend. For being on the floor, by it's
                        nature,
                        brings one to breathe, and by that, remain ample and strong; and through that, brim and thoughtfull. But
                        this breathe, which procures such good, is merely apart of position (on the floor), and comes naturally.
                        But, certain decisions may render this mute; namely foods comparable to pizza and inordiante amounts of
                        sugar --espeically those, in small amounts even, of choclately comparison. These cease your ability to
                        deeply breathe; and naturally, as one does during yoga, or while on the floor. And this creates a sort
                        of
                        stricken posture; partially on the floor, as it is not so upright on it's own, but through the breathe
                        and
                        it's elevation of your gait --or natural lift. When this goes, and your on the floor --out of devotion--
                        your torso bears the load, and through harsh fortuity. This makes our orbiting efforts more brazen, in
                        that
                        they move from stricdken grounds; and these causes further wear on our frame. The result may be that you
                        do
                        less; which is poor for leisrue and producitivy; but also your system, as your congurency for food
                        lessens,
                        along with more stabilizing and resotrative motions; which bear much solidity and grace to your sleep
                        and
                        employment.

                        So I had this weird thought. Based on what I was saying earlier, I'd describe my 'angst and need for
                        validation' as coming from the fact that I write so much, and thus have so much to say; but feel if I
                        just
                        said what I mean in short, that it would seem weird, and be put down. From writing so much, what I have
                        to
                        say is quite original. And because it is so different, I am not secure (or without any rooted fear
                        below),
                        as to just say it as it is. As such, I say more than I need to, as part of me feels like I need to be
                        more
                        convincing.

                        So we are liberty to do as you please. I get swept up sometimes in the winds of the world; but so is
                        this
                        via a format. In more deep and deliberate forms, 'the impressions from such', we actually see the world
                        bigger, and feel our efforts small.
                        <br>&emsp;I cannot help but take a present measure, and let our actions build from the grounds which we
                        then
                        set. Nothing seems of worth otherwise. There is not prevailing condition or pedigree; and it seems more
                        and
                        more that no one cares. Our lives are just full of tension and services; goods and expectation. And
                        there is
                        little for me to say regarding that which is, in fact, a result of a lapse in our measure.
                        <br>&emsp;For when were in that, we just see, soft and plainly. It never feels like we need to be
                        somewhere,
                        or have something set in mind. We already moving, calm and set. But, something is sprouting, coming to
                        be by
                        our prescence in seeing it. It comes about, slightly every day.
                        <br>&emsp;For the point in life is that all things great and meaningfull are beyond your common rythm.
                        In
                        truth, things of the former sort just draw you more; but are not so different in the actions they
                        produce.
                        "It is by their worth and appeal that you do more, which is what we seek." But we still do things of the
                        sort now; but without such a draw and passion as born of such mighty gleam.
                        <br>&emsp;I constantly refure the norm, or what is esteemed as gossiple and truth; or so clever and
                        wise.
                        And I do this, because were on our own. The tenure of such is brought by our undying self-regard; and
                        our
                        lack of direction and or resovle as born from a lapse of this. We are, in employment and propiety,
                        stable
                        and flowing, moving and steady. And from here, dreams of impact and production arrise, 'but on a stream
                        of
                        merriment and strenght; a sort of flourishing path, or state within such, that is not drawn to but see,
                        and
                        meet it'. There isn't this oppertunity or condition which drags me out of our state. For, in irony, we
                        may
                        amend based on what we see, 'but it amounts to direction, or application rather,' as being within our
                        state,
                        we never cease, and merely ordain our efforts to faciliate an accompanying creation ---ontop of our more
                        known amends, to this novel one seen.
                        <br>&emsp;I admitt nothing when it comes to the values and principle I believe. These have come from
                        years
                        of hard panging effort; an enormous amount of solitude, potential contraiety in our aversion to all
                        common
                        goods, and an otherwise reconcilable disdain for those moments that we do slouch, 'and feel like were
                        misguided and wrong'. It is only our lapse from the truest self. The one which needs to goal or
                        objective,
                        because our being is enough. I need no such aim for work, nor family and delight. It is only those
                        things
                        which begin to sparkle around these, upon our little measure slipping, 'and these near things fading
                        away;
                        upon which foregin affairs and youtfull grandeur shine'. Are we not already focused and arranged? Is it
                        not
                        enough to return to these; or better put, to our meausure, as to lift above these nearest things, 'and
                        from
                        there, truly see the stars: but not from our focus being absent, and all things pithily viewed and or
                        sought
                        breaking in, 'as the clouds of our real focus whithers'.

                        I can tell were a little bothered by things; and namely because of our state, and the prescence of
                        something
                        to deal with.
                        <br>&emsp;Our finances have not been so fine compared to recent years. My admissions to forutne are one
                        thing. But in practice, we are making several hundred dollars every two weeks, have removed our debts,
                        and
                        are more or less on the upwind of income. Our total rests near 2500, with many months to likely come. I
                        see
                        us getting another scooter, for about 500, and our computer is in not dire need for repair. It has been
                        fine
                        for so long; and the sound of it is not even that bothersome. "When I think of starting new games
                        though, I
                        despair."
                        <br>&emsp;But our current scooter is an issue. The back tire is becoming a point of concern. I've orderd
                        glue and new strips; as we had to replace the old one a few days ago ---which had lasted several months.
                        This one did not last a few days. As it were, we had to really jam it in there, and it came out several
                        times. I don't feel it was a strong plug. This may entirely be due to the nature of the whole; but the
                        strip
                        itself, being the last from a year ago, is not exactly sticky, and so more easily brought nout. Plus, we
                        had
                        no glue --though I don't think this contribtued to it not staying in.
                        <br>&emsp;I will try to plug the whole, and if it seems secure, then good. We have purchased a
                        replacement
                        tire, for about 40$, and will likely have to pay the same for it to be installed. This cannot be done
                        till
                        the following Monday. "Note that the path by veras is covered in glace; odd, but do take pause, and go
                        to
                        the side."
                        <br>&emsp;If for whatever reason this tire cannot be replaced, then we will buy a new one. As far as I'm
                        concerned, our money is made as a source for utility and potential moving. Beyond our fortune and
                        support,
                        we are above the threshold in which this can occur. I do not see us leaving during the summer, and so
                        more
                        will be saved. And my PC is more or less fine, and in all fairness, ripe for a winter upgrade.
                        Battlefield
                        and or GTA are coming out, but these are on playstation. And Avowed and Red Dead are fine for the PC
                        now. As
                        has Civ been near excellent. Ark 2 perhaps will prove me wrong; but it is nowhere to be seen. "And to
                        interject, but playing BF, Diabloe and Ark with Matt has been great, and some Minecraft with Tristan
                        also. I
                        really feel we are holding ourselves back, in the farthest and simplest of ways."
                        <br>&emsp;Right now, we have 1300$ cash in our TD savings, plus 500 in the TFSA, and the middling AMC.
                        We
                        have just over 900$ in our Coast Capital ---plus a meeting to iron out passwords and cards, after work
                        on
                        tuesday. We have 50$ on our credit card. These are our funds.
                        <br>&emsp;By our need, and the means to properly allocate it by the virtue of immediacy, 'and our
                        pleasure
                        in doing so based on the rythm were in now', I am affording you the tire and repair which you've already
                        placed, plus the earphones --whihc albeit icky, is but an offering to the benevolent gods. I am not
                        condoning a new scooter purchase ---though I do see a nice on, Jaison, which, like the rest, is 32 km/h,
                        360vh, solid tires; yet it is of good make, solid platform, rear suspension, and a bit more power for
                        slopes. It is 450 with tax. But of no need now. Worse case scenario, is we walk to work on Tuesday and
                        Thursday; we have a single shift on the following tuesday, 6-230 (an oddity which is been set to not
                        repeat). We can walk the neighbourhood --which we don't do enough--- use our parents tendancy to shop,
                        and
                        our means to go to Langley Market, or Sev for bananas. We may also drive on occasion. Then, we can put
                        our
                        mat on the deck, and sit there for the morning, day and dusk. We ought do this more anyway! It's there
                        at
                        least. "And I do find, that by natural inclindation, we go on our scooter; but without this sense that
                        were
                        missing or in need: just as we please. It is also in part because we could message Matt to play a game.
                        I
                        feel relatively strong that we are not avoiding him, or in need to constantly say hello. As far as I
                        know,
                        he is at home playing games, and will be there if I ask him to. There is no reason to exepect he is
                        dead, or
                        upset with you and turning his head, if you do not play with him everyday. Were good."

                        <br>&emsp;Well, for one, you have your adaptive elements; where you plan for settlments and conquest
                        based
                        on the land and neighbours you have. If there's natural wonders, clusters of important resources, some
                        sort
                        of esteemed terrain.
                        <br>&emsp;But then you have tbe laws of nature: legacy paths. These are unmitigable; and albeit
                        responded to
                        in an adaptive sense, they are not things which you can avoid or alter; at least, you can at most ignore
                        them, but then loose their oppertunity.
                        <br>&emsp;The first thing, is that antiquity military golden ages are useless. You get 1 infantry per
                        conquered settlement. This would not be of interest to me if you took 10: as you may eventually build
                        these
                        in a few turns in your cities; nor do you start with too few units going into exploration. What is good

                        the military tree is a +2 settlement limit. You need 9 points, 2 coming for every conquered settlement.
                        I
                        tend to say, settle 4 or 5 of your own, and take 3 to 2 (respectively) of another. You may assess this
                        based
                        on who your neigbour is, where their placed, the ease of their defenses, along with the timing of your
                        available offense.
                        <br>&emsp;Science and culuter operate similarly, giving a golden age version of their +4 base yield
                        building, and +1 per adj. resource or mountain (resp.). Science is more or less easier to reach, as you
                        need
                        only have enough science to get codexes throughout the tree; while culture requires 7 wonders, and this
                        is a
                        very competative and prioritizing path. I lean more towards the culture, as I value the early boost to
                        exploration civics. But you may counterbalance this by investing into the culture attributes. "As
                        culture
                        tends to die off once theolgoy and unique civics are researched. And the only race is to the first piety
                        civic, and, somewhat, to El Escorial. While science retains its utility throughout the age, for units
                        and
                        mastery buffs." It's also worth noting, that if there are no mountains, you may still benefit from
                        amphitheaters, as 5 cities with a base of 4 is still a solid boost of 20. You will certainly have 7
                        wonders,
                        which will give a few points, and your bound to have a mountain or two which some of your theatres will
                        be
                        adj. too; and so the expected boost is at least 25. So work for this as you will; but not with hesitance
                        to
                        it's worth, but rather your means of accomplishing it. Gate of Nations is essential, and not so
                        competative.
                        Dur-Shurakin, alebit moderatley useful, come's a bit sooner and is quicker to go; but if your initial
                        settlers are out, don't fret about making it. "Considering your pressing goal is to reach 7 wonders
                        total."
                        Emile Belle is usefull, though if you get the diplo point for your first suzerain, then it's not
                        essential.
                        But not so competative. "A great second city build." Weiyang, aleit extremely competative, is
                        particularly
                        good, as it aids you in future suzerain acquisition. It requires grassland though; which may limit your
                        competitors. The lower tree ---terracota and theodoric-- are unreachable; but thsu oppertune for you to
                        move
                        ahead to the end/top of the tree. Oracle and Colosseum are the least competative I find. Nalanda is most
                        competative; but, from their monks mound becomes fought for and later colossus; while Angkor watt
                        generally
                        gets left behind. The science tree holds little worth, besides Pyramid of the Sun; but without
                        emphasizing
                        science it is tricky to get. The proper approach is, prioritize Gate of Nations, Weiyang and Angkor.
                        Build
                        Emille if you can, and rest easy on Oracle and Colosseum; they are seldom built until Theodric is done.
                        The
                        point is, if wonders is your aim, then go through your needed motions, of settling, core buildings,
                        military
                        etc. and build the wonders as they come; prioritiy one's ought have the prior neccessities established
                        for
                        them to be made; while less needed one's can be held off till your empire is solid, and then you make
                        it.
                        There is often points in the mid game that have this oppertunity.

                        I can't quite recall what I meant to say. Something along the lines of exercise; but also another.
                        <br>&emsp;For the first, we need but do what is good for the moment; but must, and surely as we've
                        enstated
                        for stretching and eating enough, do some sort of exercise. The point being that if it be free range,
                        full
                        range, mixed and or shouldered by running, through soft, concentrated or a circuit sort, that you do it.
                        Some days need this little, or have room for it if you see fit. Sometimes you may wish to squeeze
                        something
                        in; big or small. And others, you may see worth in neglect; as it is not so precocious not to exercise;
                        but
                        the future is then laid for you to wholly remain, so that when the time is better, you do exericse. "As
                        the
                        one lesson of exercise, is that it amounts to little, but pays you alot to do so; and conversely, if it
                        is
                        not done at all, then all things fail." It is like the ease in which things are dictated by gravity; yet
                        if
                        she ceases, all things go astray.

                        So I am a man, and for the most part up to par with what that means. But I concede to a bit of aversion
                        to
                        effort, or at least 'embracing struggle'. I tend to make choices which overt me from this; or at least
                        direct me as not to go such way. And for the most part this is fine; as my curiosity and delight is not
                        engendered by stress or grough.
                        <br>&emsp;Sometimes though, it clearly seems that our way is one which is upheld and 'engendered' souly
                        by
                        us. And in that, as I slip, 'I am left alone, pitiable, ashamed, and full of swallow'.
                        <br>&emsp;Alas, there is a difference between running away from right and wrong, and simply being well
                        off
                        enough to turn your head for a moment; and then enjoying yourself, or living at least, as if that moment
                        is
                        not burdened by such effort. I know, that our need for effort is clear, and so when were in harmony with
                        that, all is well.
                        <br>&emsp;So, in these lingering thoughts, I fall on the mention of exercise. It seems that, akin to one
                        pure stretch, that some mere knee raises will do. You can pair this nicely prior to leaving for the
                        fields,
                        by doing said marches; and perhaps, if richness guides you, with a few pushups as well.
                        <br>&emsp;I would like to sit here and berate the fact that you must scooter to the decent fields. But,
                        for
                        one, going back is no issue, as you can sit, stretch your legs and what not. Also, you may do a quick
                        yoga
                        session, and later on stretch your shoulders and back. "Considering the recent session, in all its
                        absent
                        roots, so were such stretches fine." Moreover, you can likely smooth into your session, even from a
                        scooter,
                        upon a prior march, as this will lighten you up. You could see if doing it directly before was ample;
                        but
                        even during your second walk, or some prior point. Even some pushups here would do. And you may jusy go
                        to
                        the field, and do the simplest things there. Pullups and squats are best when garnished. Though they may
                        be
                        done more reguarly

                        I had this thought for some time, that our need to declare a path was a remark of our shortcomings; in
                        that,
                        from them, we were still, idle, wishing; and thus we sought for an aim which would bear promise, and
                        through
                        that, remedy our inaction.
                        <br>&emsp;This seems ever more true now. I can't quite say how we've been thinking about it, but this
                        idea
                        'of a path', is one which doesn't resignate with me anymore.
                        <br>&emsp;I mean to say, in our loose words, that why we feel this is so, is from a notion which, albeit
                        spoken recently, is not so clear. It has to do, or at least falls along the lines not doing things
                        right, as
                        evidence by your need for clarity, but therein, 'as if being brought by an aim', we seek such a point
                        which
                        would draw us to act so rightly, and seemingly remedy our state. Only, I'd say the honest reflection is
                        that
                        one ought deal with the result of their action, assess the cause, and more ordinately adjust. "For we
                        end up
                        mending our feelings of the current error, rather than letting the solution pan out."
                        <br>&emsp;I see that our trouble is one of task. As we are well set and equiped to do as we deem fit;
                        but
                        are rather thrown by the remedial nature of it; particualry, as it cowers under the glare of our primary
                        duties. My resolve then is to fortify such tasks as not to be so thrown; so that we may adpat under
                        load,
                        and otherwise be more regulary stout, and propulsive.
                        <br>&emsp;The two elements of this are food and training. One is to do with whole foods, their
                        preperation,
                        and the avoidance of processed (and expensive) meals, nor any intruding indulgences: all which come when
                        our
                        stores and prep fall short, and give way to some other means to eat --as this is itslef neccessary, and
                        a
                        point of hinderance (as we become famished). Exercise is similar, in that if we have the basis for it
                        set,
                        we tend to do so in harmony with our work, off time and everyday rythm. We have found great benefit in
                        developing long from routines, but are lacking short ones. The point of the former is that, following
                        rough
                        days or bouts of hard work, you may need more guidance to train. But, on good days, or those where our
                        rythm
                        is of a frequent sort [smaller yet many bouts], we'd benefit from equally smaller sessions. In all
                        things,
                        training, in the sense of practice via guidance, ingrains us with firmer sorts of the motions we do 'off
                        the
                        cuff', and thus through our day to day rythms. We have this from our life so far, but many potential
                        sides
                        are off, and not so engrained. The long form is good, but the short form is a needed addition.

                        It pays one no deficit to have ppor thoughts. "They merely trinkle on."
                        <br>&emsp;You may say then, 'what about good ones, don't they drip similarly?'. And I'd say,
                        confidently,
                        that thoughts which are good, so much as they are not bad, are so, as to be of a form which is made by
                        an
                        act, which, in being acted, makes the result good. "In the way, that telling the truth makes a statement
                        solid: not by what the statement is, but that it was spoken truly."
                        <br>&emsp;In this way, when we form our thoughts, helm them, spurr them with fidelity and care, the ends
                        are
                        good in as much as such qualities -- in which their brought to be--- are fair.
                        <br>&emsp;It is not an unimportant point to state, that this does not strictly mean that the contents of
                        such thoughts are deemed just based (more or less) but the nature of the thinking which brought them
                        there.
                        It is merely to say, that thoughts which come about loosely and meekly flutter away, 'as a beam bolted
                        weakly tends to fall'; so do thoughts born and goverend with otherwise measures (or values) of strenght,
                        or
                        at least qualities, which akin to the poorly bolted board, 'whereby ppor is some assumed aspect to the
                        motion of the bolting', that so in the contrast of this, 'in bolting well', that well in the context of
                        thinking, bears certain qualities which, in bearing thoughts, we deem such thoughts well. "For the paint
                        on
                        the wall or portraits hung up may be crass and cruel; while the wall itself is sturdily built." In that,
                        Hitler may have had thoughts of a tremendous sort: but the ideas, or contents rather within them, were
                        petulant and crude.
                        <br>&emsp;What were trying to say then, or at least the distinction which our point requires, is that
                        thoughts and ideas are seperate, in that one is the wall, the other the ornament.
                        <br>&emsp;And so, my point, is that thoughts which are poor, 'in that they crumble' do us no harm, as it
                        is
                        not them which hold any idea which we act upon. Their effect may not be irrelevant, 'as we may have
                        ideas
                        drug down by poor foundations'; but it tends to be the objects within solid thinking that come to
                        fruition.
                        And I say this, for it is no cost to us to think in awkard ways: as so much as such thinking is such
                        way,
                        'it's contents will not come to spurr'. The benefit though, is we get in the motion of thinking, like an
                        exercise. Indeed, we do want firm thoughts and ideas within to boot: but if our time is spent thinking,
                        and
                        to no solid avail, so be it. "For the weakness of such frame holds little which we act on: and we are

                        "For
                        in all of our reflectio nand inquiry, we still don't know."
                        <br>&emsp;I do so the road ahead, and it is full of things ahead. From gods and matter, mind and stone.
                        <br>&emsp;But were still in this state where were falling, and trying to oppose this through the
                        elements of
                        flourishing.
                        <br>&emsp;At any rate, we are in need of an oultine regarding food. Corn seems a solid food when paired
                        with
                        edmamae. Each feels a bit too much when our training is low and our needs are thinner. But, ideally,
                        we'd be
                        with such need, and thus of corn. Bread is similar, in that it becomes quite nice, and something
                        delicate.
                        <br>&emsp;Smoothies remain a staple, and thus our need of milk, flax, kale, berries and bananas.
                        Cucumber
                        and peanuts has become quite good, and relatively cheap. Oranges too are so good and simple.
                        <br>&emsp;I think my lack of training, or consistency of it, makes the midday harder. As we struggled
                        once
                        in trying to fill this; and we've done so by having several smaller smoothies, and the corn and edamame
                        in
                        the late afternoon. But I still feel a bit famished. In part, because we are not in truth eating much;
                        and
                        our lack of exercise squanders what we do eat. I feel that lentils will make a welcome return; and
                        perhaps
                        kale also.

                        <br>&emsp;For glyphs, considering we can do 45 easily, once were past glyph 25, we don't get 2 ranks,
                        and
                        benefit little from higher pit tiers. My feeling is if the tier is above the glyph level, the chance is
                        high. So we just run as low as we can, and once we hit glyph 40, we bump it up tier 45.
                        <br>&emsp;Masterworking. Rank 1 costs 100 obducite, rank 2 is 700, 3 is 5000. Nightmare dungeons give
                        around
                        700 at t3. For me, spend the gold to secure the the best crit, then let the 2nd one be. We should be
                        able to
                        be 8/12 on all our gear. For skill ranks, they get +1 midway to rank 2, and again midway to rank 3. The
                        final 2 points cost the most --11 then 12--- so beyond getting everything to 8, we can still add a point
                        or
                        two to get the second plus to our skill.
                        <br>&emsp;Greater affix gear has higher base stats and affixes. This makes the MW scale much better. We
                        should farm bosses to get GA versions of all our uniques. Also, you can't go past rank 2 if it's not
                        ancestral.
                        <br>&emsp;I believe if something ins greater affix --on normal legendaries-- that the aspects have a
                        higher
                        chance of being higher. We can target farm aspects through the gambler, in hope of better aspects. "40

                        So just thought I'd share this with you, but for many years I've sat on the floor --and slept there too.
                        It's an odd thing to do, but I feel great. Only, in the recent year or so, I've started getting these
                        horrible headaches. It's not random, but occurs when I've been been exercising very little, then try and
                        get
                        back into things. My body struggles to adjust. I do alot of yoga (a vareity of it) normally, but doing
                        so
                        becomes essential in order to avoid these headaches. I did not do any yesterday, and worked out in the
                        morning, and just felt terrible last night.
                        <br>&emsp;D4 is pretty much saying 'fuck you' to me, computer wise. And honestly, blasting wares me out.
                        I'd
                        like to keep playing, but with the former being the case, I can't even look past the fact of the latter.
                        I'm
                        gonna keep playing for a few days, but probally back out. They do XP and loot goblin events half way
                        through
                        the season, so return then.
                        <br>&emsp;I would love to play Ark. As far as I know, my PC says sure to that. In a bit though. I'll
                        still
                        play D4 till then, but maybe not as much. I'll let you know. Prbally gonna start a sinlge player game.
                        Just
                        need to relax and get myself ironed out.

                        So, as a kid, I ran around. Like most. And I recall our first venture into soccer, on timbits. And
                        things
                        were par for the course. We soon entered a child's league, and played on the TREX. We were a great team,
                        and
                        via my speed and general skill, was a solid player.
                        <br>&emsp;During elementary, we were the fastest kid in our grade. We won all school races through grade
                        one
                        and five. At the district races, we came 4th twice and 8th once; then, in grade 4 and 5, we went to the
                        Alouette races, and came 10th and 6th.
                        <br>&emsp;As the years went on, we remained atheltic, but did not excell. There were people as fast, or
                        sometimes faster than me. And people began to become much stronger; as we were not a part of working
                        out.
                        During our highschool years, we would do bootcamps during P.E, and we'd succeed more or less. We felt
                        good
                        about ourselves, in the same way we did about our classes; in that we simply felt assured of our
                        prowess.
                        <br>&emsp;But as the latter part of highschool came, we felt a little insecure. Our size was rather
                        thin,
                        and our ability in soccer was rather sub-par. I did not apply myself as if I cared, but I noticed how
                        unremakrable we were. We joined fitcon, and did well enough, but to not amazing end. And despite being
                        skilled in soccer, our excellence was not harnessed; nor did we care to continue playing.
                        <br>&emsp;During our grade 12 year, we had gone through some personal trouble. And out of the ashes, we
                        committed oursleves to working out. At first we went to the gym ona whim and found ourselves acquainted
                        with
                        the equipment and moves. We felt quite confident in the esteemed 'monster powder', to gain weight; but
                        to no
                        avail. We kept on, established a generally good supplement routine; ate much better, 'in hashbrowns and
                        eggs'. And by the fall, we were benching a plate, had thicker shoulders and arms, and generally felt
                        strong
                        and upright. This practice lost it's prominence though through the winter, but regaind an amiable pace
                        through the following spring. I recall meeting someone from school during a coaching session, and how he
                        remarked our size. Someone even commented on me during our graduation party, how well I looked.
                        <br>&emsp;As I did graduate though, our routine diminished. Mostly out of care. And as we went through
                        college, we did little. Our sensibilities may have remained, but our practice less so. During the summer
                        of
                        2015, we found much resolution and joy in eating wholesome. Our exercise remained somewhat absent; but
                        we
                        did bring it to some prominence through calisenthics. The inpracticality of this, in that we'd do it at
                        home, made for much inconsistency. But, eating grains and fruit deliberatley had wonderfull effects. We
                        did
                        not cease eating junk, but did not do so as we did in our younger years. "On a whim, and often." I
                        recall
                        returning to the gym that year, in the fall, and finding much strenght and benefit. Though, albeit
                        handled
                        somewhat poorly, I lost the care for such; out of merrit and concern in the weight lifting (to be
                        exact). As
                        the new year came, we exercised moderatley, and in a mix of free-weight, weights and aerobics (including
                        recreation). Generally though, our focus was on food, and not much else. "Training happened, big or
                        small,
                        as it did or didn't."
                        <br>&emsp;Later on the year we were employed at Save-On, and we had vowed to exercise more. And there
                        was
                        this hesitation to do the pushup and pullups which we deemed proper. We felt that our size would be
                        small.
                        And there was nothing much besides this, in terms of metabolic concerns. But we did go through, and
                        found
                        much good in doing so. Our concerns were not met, and the benefit from free-weight took course. This is
                        also
                        when our yoga efforts came to prominence. "Notably, in our experience of in-house training, which has
                        much
                        benefit for quality and volume."

                        So Diablo 4 boots up, shows the company logos, then goes to a log in screen. Initially, it would go the
                        former, reboot the pc, then next time it'd go through, and 50/50 it would reboot at some main menu
                        screen,
                        or upon loading into the game. Also, the login screen has stuttered for some time, and often the game
                        will
                        freeze. There has never been reboots till recently.
                        <br>&emsp;Then, I set my power settings as such: I switched the PSI power setting to 'not limited'. What
                        seemed to happen then, is that the game would reboot on first launch, then be fine the second try. In
                        tangent with this, I also blew out dust from all my fans. The stuttering at the login screen seemed to
                        go
                        away. On one occasion it did stutter and freeze. But on all other occasions went through. Unfortunately,
                        be
                        it a windows update or something, the reboots began happening several times in a row again. I restored
                        my pc
                        to the point before Diablo came out and I had made any changes, and still, a reboot. The windows updates
                        seemed to have remained though.
                        <br>&emsp;One of the odd things I noticed, is that when the game would not reboot, the little blue
                        cursor,
                        which would spin to show loading, would scale up a little (and get bigger), and when this was so, the
                        game
                        did not reboot. Resolution seems to have been an issue for the pc as a whole. I have been playing civ 7
                        4k
                        max settings for several months now; but in the midst of this, I tried it out, and as I went to change
                        the
                        resoltion, the game rebooted. It seems fine besides this. But I installed Ark, which I've played many
                        times
                        before, and as I got to the main menu, and went to settings, reboot.
                        <br>&emsp;Oddly enough, upon the restore and this reboot from Diablo, upon the restart to the windows
                        screen
                        (where I put in my password), the pc rebooted. This has never happened --only when launching games,
                        certain
                        ones at least.

                        So I've played Diablo 4 for years now. No problems. The only issue is that when reaching the login
                        screen it
                        stutters, and sometimes freezes.
                        <br>&emsp;Since April 28th, upon launching the game, the pc resets. This will occur several times, then
                        the
                        game will go through. At the main menu, or a moment after loading into the game, reboot. Sometimes I
                        will
                        get to play, and there's no issue.

                        late all is messed up. Civ still works, but I went to the settings, tried to change the resolution,
                        reboot.
                        <br>&emsp;So I cleaned my fans, set the PSI usage to 'no limits', and the reboot would still happen, but
                        only once. It would then go through. This also removed the stuttering at the login screen. This was the
                        case
                        for several days. But for some reason, went back to rebooting after several launch attempts. "It is
                        usually
                        after the first company logo is reached, then reboot."
                        <br>&emsp;I tried restoring my PC to an earlier date --prior to these happenings--- but to no avail.
                        First
                        attempt to launch D4, reboot. And oddly, upon it reseting to the windows screen --where I put in my
                        password-- reboot. Which has never happened before.
                        <br>&emsp;I am hesitant to bring this problem to you. As my experience has been that the issue is
                        somewhat
                        inconsistent. The fee for repair is quite large for me, and I'd hate for much time to be wasted on
                        formalities, when in fact, performance wise, the PC functions great --and has been for a long time. The
                        issue is from a driver, or part of windows update, or something. Which I don't imagine is easy to find.
                        I am
                        wondering then to the nature of your service and what it entails. What if you find no issue, am I
                        charged?
                        What if you find a supposed issue, fix that, but the problem persists: do I get charged to bring it back
                        in?
                        <br>&emsp;I will admitt that my PSU has been a candidate for issues for some time, as it seems a bit
                        older,
                        and the airflow to it is poor. My GPU is a 6800xt, and last year there was an issue with some games
                        causing
                        a power failure upon lauch --not a reboot as in the present scenario, but hard system shutdown, like
                        instantly. I took it in for repairs, and the person merely set the xbox store to 'high performance', and
                        the
                        issue went away. All has been fine till now. I did the same thing for D4 and Battlenet, but to no avail.
                        I
                        am not sure what else it could be, and I only bring up that past issue, for it may be an indicator as to
                        some present problem. The issue though is different, as I have in fact played the game several times
                        without
                        issue. It is only upon the launch, and sometimes while in the menu, or while changing settings
                        (resolutions
                        notably), that a reboot occurs. And always a reboot/reset mind you, while before was hard power off.

                        So undervolting seemed to work. More tries will solidify this, but two launches, no issues. There was 1
                        in
                        fact, but the fans were off. Plus, it was only from undervolting via the automatic settings. As far as I
                        know, this set it to 1125, which was what it was at before. We set it to 1050. There was also a minimum
                        500
                        frequency, which may have helped. The fans are well, and performance is solid. I am curious though as to
                        the
                        risk of undervolting, how it effects performance, what rasiing it would do. Also, what is FSR, and is it
                        usefull for playing at 4k. Also, why can't I lower resolution to 1440p on d4?

                        I miss the days when strenght flowed through my veins. Such actions seemed like a consquence of honesty;
                        and
                        our embellishment of such was born from past trouble and pain. And so we've learned, more and more, how
                        things truly are, and what extent our honesty should reach. Thus, we are ever more strong and sturdy,
                        and
                        enriched in written word, but in the a calm and tender manner; as our adjustment to 'unburdened' honesty
                        takes shape.
                        <br>&emsp;I truly miss those days.

                        I recognize that my place in life is better than others: in both time and fortune. I know that we are
                        privalaged as to be set regarding fundemental things. But I also submitt to the fact that our own
                        actions
                        bring us into the lushness of these ways. For if we miss work, whither in health, then our good times
                        and
                        fortune will be less pleasing.
                        <br>&emsp;By that, I consent to proper itineraries. "For all things important surround them; and as they
                        are
                        vital to attend, so the itinerary for them also."
                        <br>&emsp;On our common ground, the practice of yoga is enriching. Food is also, but it's richness is
                        quite
                        suitable in being left to other proficinecies. Notably our yoga, but also our training to. I see much
                        benefit in small and frequent sessions, be it running, skips, harder motions. And equallly for yoga, be
                        it
                        for legs, standing, seated, lifts or rest.

                        I center all my thoughts, or orbit them at least, around Plutarchs notion, 'that all must abide reason;
                        and
                        it is into adulthood that we really become acquainted with such, as if nature is showing us her fullest
                        claim; while childhood holds us under nothing but our parents regard'.
                        <br>&emsp;Where I'm a bit unsure is in what nature asks of us: or what is the groove in which our
                        'rational
                        resolve' is slotted into.
                        <br>&emsp;For I see, in work for instance, that it comes and goes, but with an unceasing rythm. And thus
                        our
                        actions ought not merely appropriate to the moments of demand which come, but to the fact that such
                        deeds
                        are reoccuring. "And our habits and standard ought reflect that, stearing us towards a base congruency:
                        so
                        we are always well when such moments come."
                        <br>&emsp;But it always comes back to other people, or at least regards for the world.
                        <br>&emsp;And I believe, somewhat wholly, that this occurs because your baser amends are off, and thus
                        you
                        sit a little uneasy; or, if you find pleasure, it is of the sort which throughs you off upon your
                        duties;
                        which then directs you to 'less turbulent seas'.
                        <br>&emsp;I submitt that there are moments when I am in complete harmony with my work and family; and
                        upon
                        that, I walk easy, breathe nicely, rest plenty, and live in vital strokes. For some time my life has
                        reflected such, 'being tainted with not but the speckles of contrariety'. And indeed, I notice such
                        frictions, 'as they stand out amidst our clear gaze'.
                        <br>&emsp;"I can do it!" I find my self saying; crying almost at the certain relief.
                        <br>&emsp;It is such claim, or intent rather, which holds the key. For if your mortal, enlisted, sick or
                        employed, 'the mark of reason is in the way you oblige, the form of your response, the strenght in your
                        lane
                        --in which you go'.
                        <br>&emsp;This is what requires time and effort. The simplicity of the Gods, or nature, or civil life,
                        is
                        such that seeing so as so simple is the only baser regard. "For we may see them befuddled and complex."
                        But,
                        in that simplicity, flows the stream of of living, 'and such waters are bent towards us rowing in the
                        greatest way'.

                        The question then, as always, is what ought you do. But the prompt for this is indeed the only hard
                        part.
                        For man has never come short in his ability to amend. "Be it through Flanders or elecric fields, he
                        finds
                        the way." But that the Germans should have marched on Brussels, or that the particles beneath should
                        have
                        been found, is not so easy to say.
                        <br>&emsp;For we have many presumptions in life; and I do admitt, that in suggesting such, that we are
                        giving to much weight to otherwise 'unimpactfull' factors. As the Gods may not in fact bear much in the
                        minds of those who make amends.

                        Whe I was younger, I felt this grinding irriation at the use of logic and metaphysics. God too, as a
                        notion,
                        also fell under this.
                        <br>&emsp;What I found, was that all I needed to do, or at least what ceased this frustration, was being
                        able to see both side of things; and from there, just naturally lean, be it in consideration or belief.
                        <br>&emsp;Right now I am experiencing something similar for the world and governance. For whichever
                        reason,
                        depictions of violence and negativity about people and government burns at my soul. I feel frightened,
                        scornfull and dismayed. It is from the fact that we have too little positive mentions of the government
                        and
                        the nature of her being so orderly and structured. In those motions, if by law or beuracracy she errors
                        or
                        detains, we at least know from which grounds.
                        <br>&emsp;I won't compare this directly to philosophy, but the primary issue here is that we struggle
                        with
                        admitting anything harmfull or wrong; be it in governance or war namely. We have made great strides in
                        our
                        humanities, seeing the simplicity, honor and strenght by which officials and solidiers conduct
                        themselves.
                        "But then some clip on the news of a woman crying or man screaming consumes my mind with such imagery."
                        And
                        I resist this horror; for it's nature is so putrid, that it being so entirely is worth the abbrasion.
                        But
                        the issue, ultimately, is that I cannot admitt part of it being there, while also holding true to the
                        other
                        parts around. Again, my efforts have been in fortifying those other efforts, 'as if to squeeze any
                        horror
                        out'. Media though, be it of fiction or reality, is quite saturating, and not conducive for you to be so
                        rational. The things you see and are impressed by, almost take on a life of their own; and by the
                        abbrasive
                        nature of them, warrant your emotions to take full charge and respond. "This is why I feel so poor, as I
                        don't respond. Yet our compulsion to do so is born from such regards, as I frightfully see them."
                        <br>&emsp;As it was with the Gods, I no longer need to prove the fairness of people, nor remedy the
                        brutality of war. We can admitt the harsher sides of these things, while remaining in our prevalent good
                        side. I feel curious then, or in search of understanding, as to why things occur the way they do, and
                        how
                        any of these awful moments occur. Indeed, via heuristics and poor concepts, we find mud and grit in our
                        paces. But the earth is full of these things, amidst the grass and clouds. Our ignorance though, and
                        lack of
                        reflection as would serve our natural limits, pertrudes our ability to walk.

                        Floating near the edge is our finest regards. Yet, their dearness is too much a glimmer, 'for there lies
                        rot
                        below'.
                        <br>&emsp;This is so, I reckon, from the relation of ignorance and discomfort.
                        <br>&emsp;And, sulking below, this becomes the beacon of our aims. "As if where we wish to go is brought
                        upon by what such depths bring. This may be in aversion, honor, hope and fame."
                        <br>&emsp;But I see, as I did with the Gods, how this is so when it comes to civil living.
                        <br>&emsp;But who are we then, without such remarks. I feel airy, unfilled, and in search of
                        understanding.
                        Or I grind against that which would otherwise provide depth.
                        <br>&emsp;Perhaps the truth is in all of us, that people are hurt, that some of it is unjust. But we
                        must
                        live, for our own sakes and of others. "For we must be with our own strides to meet that of others." And
                        so,
                        remarking upon what lies beneath is an ever going process, and one which calls on nothing but our regard
                        through time. But to be moving through such point, 'flowing with the channel', requires we live.
                        <br>&emsp;But this means honesty. As too much, and I will simply speak of myself, that our idea in life,
                        our
                        refuge, comes from the relief and or yearning bound through our depths. Perhaps there is real positivty
                        down
                        there; but so our darker sides. And my point, is that as those positive ends really find peace in there
                        use,
                        rather than far wonderment, that so ought we ignore what our fears and doubts prescribe, and more
                        rightly
                        be, as a man, 'who through time and relfection, may align to said demands'. Were just running otherwise,
                        or
                        hiding, in our ability to be here and present. "For there is none to judge us but ourselves. For we
                        experience shame and peace, courage and praise."

                        We might say, simply, that in life there is pleasure, sometimes known as passion, 'of something
                        relieving in
                        that we are comforted in being on route for', and then conditions, a demand; and as such, the response
                        is
                        one which offers peace and firmness, by virtue of the neccessary result which we are afraid to occur;
                        and
                        thus, the ease within, by 'our' ahility to meet otherwise. This, to be clear, is bounded by a
                        surrounding
                        prescence, a sort of cause in which your response is the measure, as it determines the effect, 'or at
                        least
                        is what we find to be the gauge for such'. While pleasure, in being bound to something, holds with it
                        true
                        comfort in that the moment is pleasing, but our response is one of ease by virtue of what were given: as
                        if
                        the cause is whats good.

                        some chore, or something to do. It may slip my mind, but the effect is not forgotten, 'or aloof to me'.
                        <br>&emsp;From that, I would say that there is room for pleasure in life, or for things good in
                        themselves,
                        but ought we be cemented in our conditions, 'as to avoid pain and grieving'; and thereby earn a proper
                        calm
                        and peace upon congruence; a feeling of ease and security, but through our endowed abilities: by our

                        Going back, we were too torn and asunder to delight in the joys of youth. On one end, we felt consumed,
                        or
                        at least endowed, to the 'grown up' demands upon me. Not so much there trouble, but their ask. Grades,
                        work,
                        sports, chores, respect. Not to mention the future.
                        <br>&emsp;My response to these was to deal with them as well I could, or felt like; but enough to
                        satiate
                        the source of the request. "I quite enjoyed the peace which would come; along with avoiding the ardour
                        and
                        disdain if I failed."
                        <br>&emsp;I went through life this way, in effect getting by. But when it came to friends, this did not
                        fly,
                        as our relation with certain folk did not permitt me to be so intense; and in one moment I was, as we
                        were
                        familiar. "Which I can relate to a later experience, where I did not care for someone, and was rather
                        removed from converse; but then upon them leaving, I was rather open, as if I was no longer hiding."
                        Similarly, in this prior event, I was open based on our acquaitnece with said folk, but not actually
                        connected enough to speak as I did. In an equal fashion, our first relationship floundered over our
                        expectations, but shortcomings by me. Fortune also played a part, as my friend got thrown about, and
                        left.
                        And my second friend removed himself from our social circle.
                        <br>&emsp;As such, I met the peak of our youth with dispair and the weight of indolence. This caused no
                        interest in 'the future', but rather an abatement of our despondance; and, as it were, a contrasting
                        indulgence.
                        <br>&emsp;But time goes on regardless of how you orient yourself, and of the things I was avowed to
                        through
                        my youth, so did these remain. The nature of these being from my parents, meant, that upon by disease
                        and
                        reckless fruits, that so were we less effective in our duties, nor so willing to do it. So conflict
                        ensued.
                        <br>&emsp;I've always been afraid of girls, meeting strangers too. It's not that I am nervous if a
                        situation
                        brings us together; instead, theres a distaste, as if I would rather not see them. Extended family is
                        similar, in that it feels like a task to meet with relatives. Only, when I get there and werre on
                        'familial
                        terms', I feel not that I must hide, and can just be. "I dont wish to fart," per say, but I want to
                        laugh,
                        run, eat and play. And it does not always feel like I can do this around older folks, or those, who by
                        my
                        younger estimate, are of a softer, quiter, and, at a later age, genial sort. I'd say this marks my
                        truest
                        delight.

                        I must say, that the greatest difference between my younger and grown self, is the reliance, care and or
                        interest for money. We make so little, strive for little, rely on so little, and otherwise amend and or
                        attend to things that require and or thrive on such.
                        <br>&emsp;What a mouth full.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, our remarks here are so stretched. As on one hand, you have this massive account of
                        our
                        life, 'one in which, by our age, we've made the most, and best of said accounts', regarding our place in
                        life, the relation to work, duty, leisure and friends. "And all things nice and ahead."
                        <br>&emsp;But we then have our younger years, where we loved food, to smoke even, to see Colin and Seb,
                        playing games, watching movies and tv. I rememebr this getting thrown about, as going out with more
                        friends,
                        where drinking, driving, girls and drugs were the concern. There were at points lounging, 'but it was
                        all
                        chilling and hanging out'. Little of it actually felt like an activity or interest. And I just felt more
                        inclined to the adventures with Colin than with Seb.

                        I was always good as a kid. Relatively smart, for what it was worth, but very athletic. If there was
                        soccer,
                        I was nearly the best. At hockey, I played goal and had such a good time. I only ever played soccer
                        league
                        wise, but in all fashions, I could play well. "We'd play tag football, from one side of the field to the
                        next, and I could score as many points as I like. I'd stop near the end just to keep playing." In short,
                        I
                        was fast.
                        <br>&emsp;But I recall during my later years, that Lucas Henniger, and later Connor Mcfarlen, started
                        keeping up with me. And I had this feeling, where I was not struggling to match them, but I no longer
                        'sped
                        past them'. By their efforts it seemed, they caught up. And my response was not to work harder as to be
                        even
                        further, but to keep in line with them, in a genial fashion. I would joke though, as if it were my
                        mantle to
                        maintain, 'and I'll win, and you come first'. It was as if I were responding to their efforts, and
                        making
                        sure they didn't overreach. I remember our final year, thinknig Connor might have beat me. He didn't,
                        but I
                        rememeber being more or less surprised when I candidly one.
                        <br>&emsp;It is strange to think though that I felt some sort of shame, or embarrsement at the thougnt
                        of
                        losing. I'd tack it up to the fact that our success, in late childhood at least, was from our nature,
                        rather
                        than training. Those other guys nearly beat me, and had my eye when their effort began to equal mine. I
                        felt
                        so thwarted and scared, for I had no effort of my own. "I was soon to be last, in my mind, for being
                        first
                        was all I really knew. But whereas someone who trains consistently and comes second keeps on, as there
                        efforts bring to carry forth, our natural momentum would have ceased, as it was merely our strides going
                        where they could naturally, 'like a mighty steed who was strong in principle, but not habition'." And
                        so, if
                        we were to come second, running would mean nothing to me, as we would simply be doing what we did,
                        'unaccalimed by our short prestigousness', but not then bent or aimed at anything further. "As if the
                        tide,
                        or the crowds eye past me by, looking to those ahead: to a place my future had no sight of."
                        <br>&emsp;I felt this pressure from 'unexcellence' throughout my life. I would see where I was in fact
                        prestine, and by that, recognized by the peak of our success. I felt so good being so high. I didn't
                        even
                        feel great about my self, but rather at peace in being so indifferent. "For where else could I go." But
                        as I
                        aged, and things became more challenging, and relatively speaking, people got stronger, or ordained at
                        least
                        to those feats, so was our moderate point of success not so accomodating to indifference. We felt poor,
                        lame, unappealing and unknown. Our momentum within this had us bolted to such challenges; as I did not
                        wish
                        or strive for anything akin to excellence, 'but in line with how poor we felt', we responded to such
                        things
                        with the mind of not feeling so bad. Success for us was that which did not leave us feeling embarrassed.
                        If
                        we went on a long run, good was not coming in first or anything of a remarkable sort; it was whatever we
                        felt solid about. If we got a bad grade, we were embarrassed to share, and scared to show it to our
                        parents.
                        Getting Bs then felt good enough. But you see, there was no care about the things in themselves, but how
                        we
                        felt in response to succeeding as we did. "It was how we felt positioned in relation to others; be it in
                        expectation, or seeming impresseve, or at least adaquate."

                        So I have no issue with anybody.
                        <br>&emsp;However it's best to characterize this, I will simply say, with love and interest, or pure
                        decent
                        respect, I am such for a person of any ethnicity, sex or creed. I simply don't mind; and recognize any
                        of my
                        averionsor bewilderments as (my) personal perversions and stupidities.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, I hate others being treated poorly, shamefully, with contempt, or even with hatred,
                        abuse
                        or arrest.
                        <br>&emsp;But I take a moment, for instance, of someone saying that a company, or some person, is no
                        longer
                        of the sort, in support and or expression, regarding mistreatment of certain people. It is these moments
                        where I am not clear and or connected to the beligerence and effective plight of people. "A sort of
                        phonnieness flags infront of me."
                        <br>&emsp;A better way of looking at this, is when someone says something progressive or affirming, I am
                        not
                        against their point, at all. I am simply not privy or connected to the triumph: as if there was
                        something
                        wrong being abated. Be it touting, preaching, rhetoric or vitriol, I become overt. Better yet, I find
                        the
                        statement abrasive, and feel it muddled in the broader appeal to others; meaning, I don't particualry
                        averse
                        myself, but I reckon others do. I don't need good reasons or sense for other's lives to improve. By
                        sentiment even. But when the misdeeds of others are inherent to the claim, or progress at least, I see a
                        sort of defense and furledness by those who are averse.
                        <br>&emsp;My understanding, is that the world is a complex of points, each reflecting finer instances.
                        From
                        continents to countries, states to counties, to towns and neigjbours, streets and homes; family and
                        friends,
                        man and himself. I feel that bullying, rape, molestation, putrid beligerence, ordinary beligerence even,
                        lying, cheating, stealing, murder, fatal negligence, abuse, assault and formidable begurdgery, is
                        distributed within each strata to a degree which is, in all natural light, less than there is so. Nor do
                        I
                        feel, beyond fundementals, 'which are not born purely in expanse but depth also', that of a moment of
                        such
                        'grievences', that they are not intense causes of other similar moments; and thus, they are not to be
                        deemed
                        caused by such moment themselves.

                        I say this for the sake of inquiry; for I may bounce things off a defined edge.
                        <br>&emsp;That is, people care for things in their liberated state. "As was once delighted in, or
                        sought, as
                        a child." But due to civil and or customary duty, or manner, we are advised, 'and in many ways steared',
                        away from such things.
                        <br>&emsp;What I notice though, is that what people find good in this realm, or strata of life, is with
                        respect to their duties underneath. Regarding riches, power, pleasure and fame, one could almost say, in
                        a
                        statemet for instance regarding their worth, 'such an such is quite good, considering our current
                        state..
                        Such things would be so nice, considering where we are; and, with such bounds in mind, it is quite
                        comforting to know that we can achieve these further goods'.
                        <br>&emsp;In other words, we tend to make, or act at least, via conditios. We accept our role in life as
                        employees, parents, friends, individuals of health. And so the surrounding elements of pleasure,
                        contribution, craftmanship and joy, are given interest and or refuge, with the context of those
                        endowments.
                        "Who we are, as we know, in terms of the things we see as oppertune, and or thereby seek, is gauged not
                        only
                        by the quality of our interest, but also our condition in life. As if the murmur of our heart is not the
                        only factor in remarking upon some far delight, but also the naturally reserved and or implaced
                        sensation of
                        our feet beneath our local committments."
                        <br>&emsp;As a kid you have no such bounds, at least prominently. You must go to bed on time, not scream
                        or
                        shout when it's late, or while your visiting relatives. You must go to school, be more or less
                        attentive, go
                        to soccer practice on weekdays and games on weekends. There are some chores, in washing mainly. And to a
                        degree, gifts are obtained for giving.
                        <br>&emsp;But we have no judgement upon the shortcomings of our efforts, in quality. If we get good
                        grades,
                        great; but were not scorned if we get too few. We have no employments, nor shame in not doing so. Our
                        health
                        is given little regard by anyone, and you generally do as you please. "It's strange to think that is all
                        we'd be under measure for."
                        <br>&emsp;Intertestingly, the concern for school and employment is one, in a further sense, for
                        children,
                        marriage and family. If you remove these, then the need is one of yourself; as your roof and food come
                        from
                        your dependants; which is itself a subject to question. But in general, it is not unfair to suggest that
                        independance is both sought and or at least natural to pursue; or if only the later reach. And as such,
                        money is neccessary for the cost of your own living.
                        <br>&emsp;The balance I've experienced, is that simple work is sufficient for our personal living. Yet,
                        it
                        does not always create, or conduce with pleasures that make that work 'unlaborous'. But it never feels
                        compelling enough to cultivate other means of work, for the sake of being less laborous. Indeed, more
                        money
                        means more things, which can make the demands of work more bearable. But we have leaned towards goods
                        which
                        require little money.
                        <br>&emsp;The point, is that as a kid, I did indeed enjoy the eggs of easter or meals of Christmas. But
                        our
                        truest joy was in sport, running through the woods, games and things of a creative sort. I understand
                        that
                        these cost money, in enrollment, suppliess, or consumption even. "As Lego came as a gift, and was
                        generally
                        expensive." As an adult though, I've taken this direction, and applied it where my 'meager income' can
                        support. It is by fortune, time and grace that I earn things of mechanical sort: computer, shoes, bike
                        and
                        playstation. But with these, I tend to have the means to do what is limited only by time and effort. I
                        can
                        browse the internet, write in word processors, play Battlefield over and over, or walk and run as my
                        legs
                        will carry. For many years I felt fine with this, and sought patronage for food and a simple bed. This
                        has
                        its niceities, but also shortcomings. And currently, as our true adulthood is coming to bloom, I see the
                        natural benefit of living as though I were providing such needs, even if fortune were offering. "For the
                        main error of eventuality is removed, in that, of some future, be it naturally reached or sought, in
                        which
                        you did provide for yourself, does not come as something to adjust to, as your already living as such."

                        In the recent years, we've gone through several periods of focus, where reading, writing, formatting or
                        creation were prevalent. And I always felt great here, as I was doing something, and set for further
                        effort.
                        Something always lying ahead.
                        <br>&emsp;But now, we've moved, settled, are employed and with nothing but freedom ahead. Yet I know not
                        what to do. I have found some pleasure in gaming, and work has brought a great rythm to my life. But
                        were
                        not doing anything special.
                        <br>&emsp;It does seem like yoga and music have found their place, as have movies and varied YT
                        channels, in
                        relation to our coming and going from work. For some time we've meant to try dating online, or go to
                        yoga.
                        Each seems daunting at the moment. "Which only has me feeling the pressure from that which has me less
                        open."
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, there lies this personal effort, of how were seated, the prescence of work, and the
                        regiment, or regard at least, for exercsie and food. But, as this reaches a state of bloat, we look for
                        pleasure. As were too tired to go do other things, but were also set for better living. "As if the pipes
                        are
                        never well enough." But this state is one of waiting. As we've run for instance and trained, and are
                        looking
                        to do some tomorrow, and the next. We have no sense that our effort will cease; but as of late, we've
                        concentrated on it dearly, and had to do some of the heartier things upon a bare state; which has left
                        me
                        well worked, but needing to weather it out. "And let our initial strenght incorporate itself."
                        <br>&emsp;I find in these moments that idle thoughts and grievences occur. As we are not so ordained,
                        but
                        rather still. Happily, and with the ointment of pleasure, but also with some friction and out of
                        shapeness.
                        "Were not so well worked, that our pitch is but less prominent, yet forward. Our peak was high, but
                        small
                        now as the ryhtm comes to be; but only then for us to move; which is much of our learing so far, as to
                        cease
                        the need to improve."
                        <br>&emsp;There is worth mind you in letting your imageries and or irratable remarks float on by. For
                        the
                        things which spurr them are not really being dealt with. And instead of mourning their prescence,
                        address
                        the fact that your going to let the emotiosn they trigger slide on by.
                        <br>&emsp;But were left then, almost struck by our relative amount of work, in a state of rather
                        slowness.
                        And if we let the sparks of the world float by, but hold little view for ourselves, then we are left
                        with
                        nothing but the present. Such a state, if it were of better quality, 'in that it held a balance of
                        movement
                        and rest, rather than the beginnings of such momentum', would be easier to sit with; but instead, we
                        find
                        ourselves catering our intent to efforts invovling it ahead, and through such 'single sightedness', find
                        reason for pleasure; as we feel more or less set from our current effort, and oriented to whats to come.
                        But
                        the compulsion for pleasure seems only fair, in that there is a straightforward view of what's to be
                        done.
                        And perhaps thats fair. But the nature of these efforts is that they provide little moments, or at least
                        prescence, for oppertunity, recreation or friends. Were too busy with ourselves. And reaching momentum
                        with
                        such is not then a key to those things, 'as if our personal buisness is done'. For you then have to
                        attend
                        to the buisness of those other goods. Which is something that, if you did now, would bring more room and
                        levity to your personal one's. For your left otherwise with the mere comfort of doing something, but not
                        for
                        the end of it.
                        <br>&emsp;I resolve to the fact, or recognize at least, that our preferred spot ahead is one, where we
                        go to
                        yoga, perhaps travel for other things, take some nice pictures and post them online, for chats, quick
                        dating, 'online rooms', or relations. These would give a well needed, and able, adornment to our life.
                        We
                        are fine on the ground. And despite needing room and reason, by habit and the direction we make, so can
                        this
                        become unintruding or a drag to those broader goods. Ought we play with Tristan, or find some resources
                        to
                        share our sums. I think your life in general, for interests in light and vision, spectroscopy and early
                        government, would come about alongside our further attendances. As we are employed, with relativley
                        solid
                        finances, and family harmony, 'in both the present and time ahead'. But we are making narrow use of
                        this.
                        All, mind you, for the sake of ourselves. We need be honest though as to what's required, and hopefully
                        reach a point where the good we normally seek, is strong enough as to be more merry and fufilling, and
                        bear
                        room and agreement to the relatively light requirments of rewards of friendship, dating, submission and
                        love. These things seem like hurdles, as our parched state seeks more from them. But get yourself in
                        line,
                        so your up and ready enough, as to do these things in their right fashion. Merely submitt your sums, and
                        relish the regard. And equally for dating. Putting ourself out there is what, in contrast, we lack. Were
                        too
                        hard done to begin, and thus feel closed.

                        My aim here is not to permitt gratuity. Nor do I wish to indulge in 'a seemingly final resolve'. But I
                        do
                        wish to attend and address something of importance, namely, in what is needed of for health.
                        <br>&emsp;This is something that will always be present. And like our professional and or social cares,
                        or
                        projects abound, so will we continue to mend such things: bringing them into our life as time goes on.
                        <br>&emsp;But right now, looking back, our momentum is rough, and our fatigue is coming too closely. By
                        whichever cause, our resitance training, 'or range of motion under load', is much too little; and thus
                        our
                        recovery, ease and easting are effected. This has only been exasterbated by work, as we tend to do less.
                        Our
                        system is fine, but our muscles are reaching abscence. And sitting is not truly comfortable.
                        <br>&emsp;Doing more squats though is not something I wish to, or see much worth in, if it is just on a
                        whim. More structure is needed, as to produce more volume, and also congress with the path of
                        consistency;
                        as you see what your doing ahead, and let your current effort be what it is. This also brings more room
                        for
                        pleasure, levity and adjustment.
                        <br>&emsp;There are simple things we can do, which won't run contrary to our heightened efforts for
                        health.
                        We may sign up for online dating, take better pictures when we can, and simply message people with an
                        introduction. Someone replied to me, and I felt calm and great. We can be more open to this, without
                        spending an arm and a leg. Yoga is even moreso, as it's right there, 5 or 6 bucks, a tremendous garment
                        to
                        your physical life; and also something which can bring clarity, structure, and a sense of place. Their
                        on
                        monday mornings or nights, Thursday nights or Friday mornings. Simple. Another thing, which I've already
                        conducted, is the proper paces of gaming. If your playing with Matt, tell him if your gathering, and the
                        server is up. "We can talk when were doing something together." Same thing for battlefield. If your
                        playing
                        a match, let him know, and play for a while, or simply say your done. Just ask. But foremost, you need
                        not
                        be with him so frequently. He isn't going anywhere. Let your day go, play as you please, and be reticent
                        if
                        you wish, considering that you may wish to, or feel fairly compelled, to play longer together. If you
                        can't
                        manage that, than say nothing. It never hurts also, to figure out the threads of interest, be it in
                        music,
                        youtubin, movies, games or shows. At least make a list, for which your curious and or natural regard can
                        flow to; your expectation and or discovery will ensue.

                        We will surely say more on this later, but right now, I'd say the most critical concern is in bringing
                        out
                        more volume. And the clearest means to do that is measurement.
                        <br>&emsp;For volume is sought on two basis: continuity and production. For one, if we do enough, we
                        will
                        bear quality to the paces which bring sufficeincy; for the other, so will we have worked enough.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of measures, you have the matter of reps, be it in skips and the bounds we make back
                        and
                        forth; or the rotations of poses, in lifts for instance.
                        <br>&emsp;The purpose of this, to be clear, is not one of strict parameters, but rather a blend of
                        targets
                        we can reach and be grounded by. For we may just go out, but in that, produce more if we have some sense
                        of
                        quantity. "A whim may make for 2 sets, while bearing discretion may reach 3." This makes it easier to
                        attempt things also, as small efforts still feel of some quanity.
                        <br>&emsp;On one hand, you have the general tenants of reps and bouts; which we'll describe as number of
                        motions, and rounds of doing so. These may cross over with one another, in that you do some amount of
                        reps,
                        then pause, and do more; and you may count these as one group of reps, or a split. But in general, we
                        give
                        more leniance, or place, for variety in rounds.
                        <br>&emsp;On the other hand, you have the actual motions and or poses, and what you feel best fits them.
                        Instead of fitting them to some concieved measure, look for measures which fit them, as you know them
                        already and can consider what best suits them. Skipping for instance, finds a great deal of benefit in
                        marking the reps per bout; but is not so strengthened by concerns of how many bouts. The nature of the
                        motion is a simple one, and so keeping the bout that you do do, 'as you could in theory do many', means
                        that
                        giving strucutre to those that you do is the primary concern. For it is not too uncommon for simple
                        things
                        to be overlooked, as each spout of effort feels of no consqeunce. Squats compare in this regard, as do
                        lighter bouts of running. In regards to pushups and bar work, your ability to plank and or hold said bar
                        is
                        the limiting factor; and a pure motivator for strenghtening such means. But, based on your limit, you
                        may
                        benefit from emphasizing rounds, as to return to the short moments of stability. "As slipping, per say,
                        is
                        not very enduring, but a formal deficit: but as such, welcomes you return to a brief balance."
                        <br>&emsp;As it were, gloves and height are the limits of bar work. Moreover, I will speak in this
                        moment as
                        if such work is essential. Since all bars are different, you ought accomodate them, in your height and
                        grip.
                        You may bring any sort of stool. Something solid and even moderatley high makes our initial holds that
                        much
                        stronger. Regarding location, Jones is open weekends, Pitt on weekdays. There is a park down the road,
                        but
                        less it's raining, there may be people there. We also have our annex; but the largely better handle is
                        blocked. We may improve and or adjust to the futile one, but to no avail perhaps.

                        My body is reaching for a bit of sugar. But rather than agree to that, let's come back to our direction.
                        <br>&emsp;I see, clearly, that we need smaller sessions, for legs and supine, some prone, and for lifts,
                        and
                        perhaps some warrior and or lunging to boot. We've got good videso for our system, namely in the forward
                        fold to downward dog, and the hero pose to butterfly. These are great; though a simpler standing one
                        would
                        do.
                        <br>&emsp;But we do need a stretching mean, for we may be in the middle of the day, and wish to cross
                        our
                        legs, or lie on our back, or stomach. As may we benefit, in our deliberate effort, or when a stronger
                        whim
                        passes by, to do our lifts, ie. plank, chaturanga and downward dog. In their case, you could emphasize
                        more
                        breaths or the pure flow. I'd say, with reason, that our guides would be more akin to the latter, while
                        our
                        everyday bouts would become more of the former.
                        <br>&emsp;Indeed, a simple seated sequence is great for neck and shoulders (along with arms); while an
                        upright, legs in front session, is great for your legs and hips, followed by sinking onto your back. But
                        you
                        may also do more of a livening sequence for legs, in your low twists, quad stretch; basically, a focus
                        on
                        range of motions, while the former is about rinsing out (remedying the knots.)
                        <br>&emsp;So those are some videos to make, and short ones at best. I will say, for merriment, that we
                        can
                        use bird, or other channels. I prefer Adrian, but any is fine. The strucutre we need is important. Plus,
                        for
                        the sake of smoothness, we can take the videos we currently use and put them in their own file, as to
                        make
                        touching them up easier. I still find worth in our wide legged sesh, or the warrior one even. But these
                        are
                        for that time when you have nothing to do, or any sense at least. Our hero/back pose was not the hit I
                        thought it'd be, as it's really a relaxing cooldown. Our lunge and downward dog flow has been done
                        plenty,
                        because it is simply and nourishing. We need more things like that.
                        <br>&emsp;As for motion, I see merrit in our measurable aims. The sense I got, for instance, when doing
                        a
                        certain set based on distance, made it so I did more sets than I would normally. You can do the same
                        thing
                        with reps.
                        <br>&emsp;I reckon, or would lay things rather, that you either look at the measure within the set, and
                        considering that gauge, do as many sets as fits your means to such gauge. For the set your doing may be
                        of
                        reps and many, say 10; but then you may just do as many sets as fits your ability to do as much of those
                        sort of sets. Opposite of this is an emphasis on rounds, or number of sets, in that you set out to do a
                        certain amount, and let your reps be what they are. Pullups are an example of this, as you may not be
                        able
                        to emphasize reps enough, and thereby, give prevalence to the amount of sets; and just do the reps you
                        can
                        in each case. These usually occur when your balance (so to speak) is quick to fail; and so with an
                        initial
                        burst of strenght, you do what you can within that stable window, then rest.
                        <br>&emsp;Another notion is of rythm, or pace. Pauses remark your time in a set, where you do 5, or go
                        to a
                        point, take a breath, then come back. While resting is between sets, in that you collect yourself. A
                        break
                        between exercises is good too, be it in waiting or recovery.
                        <br>&emsp;In regards to our life, I feel a natural rythm, whereby our principle strenght provides a
                        balance
                        of rest and effort, is not so reliable. It is our general direction, but life, in its circumstances, and
                        our
                        choices, have brought me to a less than affiable state. It is as if our finances are low, and we are
                        counting on basic principles to acquire money.
                        <br>&emsp;The issue, is that we are not perfect. And perhaps our life is not formidable enough to
                        accomodate
                        me not being so 'imperfect', when our foundations for doing things that'd otherwise make me happy, 'and
                        less
                        keen for indulgence'. Moreover, it would seem, that the far end of those things which, upon abscence,
                        bear
                        me to be so mighty myself, actually come, in relatively simplicity, 'as things do while your in motion',
                        but
                        alos greatly, 'necceasrily for the furthest of things, but also the more likely for things of a dearly
                        far
                        sort'.
                        <br>&emsp;I don't mean to go far off in position, making it woven in a way that reflects our yearning
                        and
                        wishes; nor to admitt any excess of desire. Further, I would say, in our liberties, that we are fine, in
                        our
                        own consent and of that which, so much as our consent is at liberty to be, but just, so are we fair on
                        that
                        count to make the moderate amount of money we do, and in congruence with that, our rythmic nature
                        through
                        the according employment. Were all fine to be as we are. Our life, in dreasm and or possibility, lie
                        years
                        ahead, while our concern now is thorugh the months to come. Such a course is such as to, through it's
                        whims,
                        and upon its sturdier side, create clarity and or according motion towards those things which our
                        'unideal
                        state' is merely yearning and or with angst towards. All seems well.

                        I am writing this because I have something serious to say, 'and writing seems the only way to be
                        detailed
                        and honest'.
                        <br>&emsp;My life has been too sparse of activity. Going to work has abated that. I've also been too
                        removed
                        from people. Work, directly, has improved that, and has given me more interest and motion to meet/reach
                        out
                        to other people. In terms of my rhythm in life, I'm pleased with the amount of work I do.
                        <br>&emsp;For money, the future is unknown, but not otherwise a concern of mine. On one hand, you must
                        add
                        the 'Ryan tax', which is a sort of patronage I get from simply being me. "If someone were given a 1000$,
                        I
                        would find equal worth in 700." And so if I seem to work little, and earn as such, remember that my
                        effort
                        is worth more. "As I get more use of it." Practically then, if I leave this home a year or two out with
                        10,000$, yahoo. If it's13,000, it would not seem a difference. Nor 9,000 mind you. I am happy to reach
                        this
                        by putting away 500$ a month. I could do more, but the fair and merry means which give me what I
                        currently
                        have, feel so comfortable and right, that I can't help but be pleased with the amount. To me it's
                        reasonable, and if it is agreeable to you, I'll care otherwise for things which bring me delight --or
                        are
                        meaningful beyond money.
                        <br>&emsp;With all that in mind, I've heard you talk about your intent to diet. I wish to do something
                        similar. This is the sort of thing which takes time, is a kind of work in its own right; and so I bring
                        all
                        that stuff up about money, so that we understand how that side of things is being properly dealt with,
                        and
                        sufficiently, so that I may then focus on the business of health. I normally do so, but in a casual way.
                        I'd
                        like to be more measured, and give my self permission to treat these efforts as if they were serious and
                        long term.
                        <br>&emsp;I am going to start going to yoga (at the rec centre), and also go on dating sites --apps
                        maybe,
                        but ughh. Getting started with these is a little unnerving, and I feel slightly begrudged. But I'm
                        figuring
                        it out. I'm gaming with my friends, which is nice; though, this has its own issues, as you end up gaming
                        too
                        much ---as it's hard to play a game with someone for 20 minutes, which are the bouts I like to do.
                        Again,
                        I'm figuring this out. But I am feeling overall, that my health is withering, and my habits, albeit good
                        naturally, are not exhibited greatly, as were not measured or directed in what were doing. "We end up
                        doing
                        too much at once in response, which causes wear and tear, and nothing following." So, with respect to
                        the
                        months to come, I'd like to take my health more seriously, but without such haste. All these things,
                        from
                        friends, work (and maybe love) are nice; but my interest in them is of a complimentary sort, in that
                        they
                        surround me, in support and comfort. Me, personally, is full of holes and leaks, and so, 'as you mean to
                        do
                        with your diet', I'd like to do something similar.

                        For squats, I find good value in the side shuffle, as you get some lateral motion, while position
                        yourself
                        for better drops. The volume is not changed, though the clarity of each rep is. But no matter, I tend to
                        think of squats in terms of reps and distance. You may do 10, and rather quickly, or do some amount near
                        5,
                        with a pause between. Then do this 3 times.
                        <br>&emsp;For pushups, I am limited by our ability to plank. You can reset into downward dog, or you
                        forward
                        fold. But once you return to standing, your done your set and recovering. Wider arms make for easier
                        dropping, along with shallower lowering; you need not touch your chest to the ground. By that, I would
                        say 5
                        reps is a solid amount, and you can do 3 sets. Ideally, you'd do 3 sets, of several reps, pause, then
                        several more. I think overall though, we beenfit the most by our pure rep volume, doing as many as we
                        can in
                        one bout, assuming we can do a fair amount.
                        <br>&emsp;For chinups, things are similar. You may striclty do two super sets, with an amount of reps
                        that
                        is bounded by your first and second bout. Or you can do 4-5, and do this 2-3 times. For pushups and
                        pullups,
                        the more concentrated they are, the fewer sets.
                        <br>&emsp;Free range is measured in distance, where you go, pasue and come back. This is good as an
                        exercise
                        itself, for 3 sets. Or if your warming up, you may do one long set with several pauses, and some number
                        (say
                        5) of reps between. Or, you can do 5, pause, then 5, rest, then 5, pause, 5, recover. Rotations wise,
                        you
                        can do 3 forward, 3 back, rest, and repeat two more times. "I prefer resting for these, rather than
                        pausing."

                        I feel an air of confidence. Something I've felt before. It's the sort of thing where reason, in the
                        effect
                        she brings, is seen in full light, and you know, by your calm and delight in the result, that she was
                        right.
                        I feel were on route to such things now.
                        <br>&emsp;There is a great deal, plenty even, near and on the horizon. I won't go into it all, but as
                        for
                        our home, mom given me her blessing to do as I see well. Our dad is even less concerned. Some of our
                        remarks
                        may be unappreciated; and I do hesitate to say that we have a soul shift. But in the grand scheme of
                        things,
                        it's not about that, but our time, living.
                        <br>&emsp;For so long we've been caught under the rim of divine impediment, or causless melancholy.
                        There is
                        indeed a balance; one of which motion brings you away from the 'bi polar' edges.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel there is much to say, as if, beyond privalage and fortune, or sense even, that were
                        trying
                        to figure things out.
                        <br>&emsp;At the bottom sits our truest bounty, namely, the calm and even score of daily delight. The
                        thing
                        which our writing reflects, in all its many strides. "the sort of experience that upon extremes even, we
                        can
                        rest easy, as we fear no circumstance: nothing can take this away."
                        <br>&emsp;And so, that is the light infront of us, the purpose taking form. We ought merely go, so that
                        we
                        aren't so distant from the process, nor bolted in. Our health has risen itself as the key predicament;
                        as
                        ignoring your training and food leads to all things comnig to a still. Work is fine and plenty, and our
                        social life is at the very least warm. In terms of passion or pursuits, we have yoga, the fields and
                        scenery, plus the general delight of everyday being, in movies, shows, vids and games, along with our
                        writing, reading, study and craft. All of this blends well when our fundementals are in check. These
                        need no
                        elevation beyond common goodness; but the proportions of that are no so swell. Were still apprehensive
                        about
                        yoga; as were we a little distanced from work, 'and at the moment, feeling our sparse time with it'. Our
                        general health is good, but part of its foundations are too thin. Our training is too little, in
                        running,
                        free range and resistance. Our yoga has come out of hiding with great benefit. Though the majority of
                        it's
                        design has not kept our attention, 'and the bloom we were experiencing has sizzled off'. We are
                        remedying
                        this though, as are we filling out our diet with proper food. "Barley and Potatoes being the prologue to
                        our
                        work day."
                        <br>&emsp;Where I lack though is in purpose. Even if it is setting, and we need only further; with the
                        sense
                        as to bear it some form, while mainting the requisite provision of material, or substane ---which, for
                        almost our whole adult life, has been souly present, and little of the former 'forming'. We have, to be
                        fair, remarked upon basic things, which in it's own right, gave stature and grace to such things, 'and
                        thus
                        a place for them: namely in work and family'. As have we been more directed, or at least aware of the
                        baser
                        needs, when it comes to leisure and craft. But as regards life, there is this notion of creation,
                        teaching,
                        the public. And this, being perhaps the natural route for all things sizeable, is ill-formed due to the
                        complexion of our interests --or material in such form-- but also in the conduct of our motions, 'where
                        we
                        are, in some cases for instance, aware of our over bearing care, and how the form which such wish
                        exclaims,
                        is in fact born, and unbecoming, of haste and yearning. For which we don't ordain'.
                        <br>&emsp;I guess then, we are left to bear thought to the fruts of our process. It seems the proper
                        thing,
                        'for we are not destined nor patroned to great ends', to be doing merely so. For if we resolve ourselves
                        to
                        live well, and not be so idle nor with too much haste, then we are merely going, growing by virtue of
                        our
                        embalmed state. But so, in this, as such state takes form, so is this what we should remark upon. For
                        the
                        end is not already made, but becoming from our state. Perhaps you've already made up your mind, or
                        someone
                        for you.
                        <br>&emsp;Of that, I relate to Plato and Aristotle, with the interest of opening a school. Not a place
                        for
                        disciples or profession, but a place to learn, grow, mature. This exists in a basic sense, regarding
                        grade
                        schools and universitites. But these feel more vocational. And as much as they are about the knoweldge
                        we
                        seek for ourselves, I find this to be either lacking, or unremarkable. And so much as it isn't, so is
                        originality, as perhaps the end fruit we seek, something which embellishes the fairness of a school from
                        me.
                        <br>&emsp;The way I see it, is that a dsicpline, or profession, as regards ideas and what not, is aimed
                        at
                        proofs and advancment. But the practice of this is neccessarily formal, 'as only the truest truths are
                        to be
                        permitted'. And this is indeed fair. But, regarding the Gods for instance, despite this importance, it
                        is
                        generally accepted, or sought by some, to have a view of their own; to merely lean, suspect, doubt, or
                        believe even, but in a way which remarks their liberty to do so. While others are crunching the numbers,
                        developing the deepest of truths, ought all folk have views themseles. Ones they've formed and sculpted,
                        as
                        remarks their curisoities and concerns: the elements of their own thoughts and sight.
                        <br>&emsp;This is what the school is, a place in which inquiries and position are made. For each memebr,
                        they are gifted with the peace in having no recourse about being wrong, as nothing they say or state is
                        bound to judgement. "What one feels is not appropriately measured as so. What we have are words of
                        interest
                        and curisoity, not fact." Importantly though, is that, be it someone of strict discipline, or a common
                        person with novel contributions, that so is this mode of curisoity and doubt duly requiste: little would
                        ever be learned if we weren't somewhat so. And so forming your views under the guise of suspicion and
                        strenght, is not only useful for you, as you may converse and or respond in simple and gracefull
                        weights,
                        but you may also suggest, re-adjust upon another's critique or beligerency. And I don't claim that my
                        common
                        view of physics or philosophy is endowed with fruitfull promise; despite this being what the confidence
                        of

                        to produce inspiration for them to more greatly apply. For do scientists and governors not have family
                        and
                        friends, colleuges, neighbours and countrymen? Forget the negative effects which the friction with these
                        produce, but the missed oppertunity had they been so thoughtfull themselves." Would a wife or spouse who
                        could listen and inquire as to their partners work and discovery, not soften and restore said partners

                        This notion of personal wealth, as in the equity in your own self, as to procure a better experiene; as
                        contrasts with the procurement of comfiness, storage, security even, and more or less pomp and novelty.
                        This
                        is a nice sentiment.
                        <br>&emsp;Were asked to do something, to strive for such wealth. Or, were pointed towards some
                        meaningfull
                        end, where we spread a messae, form a community: remarking some cause.
                        <br>&emsp;But I feel the vanity of the former is not totally removed from the latter. As the former is
                        bent
                        on some elaborate end; for which wisdom does not cry if you fail. But this need to move, this sense that
                        your not, to which your wish for pronoumcent is found, is itself a sort of restless exertion. For ends
                        that
                        are not so lavished, but still outside oneself, but for the sake of others.
                        <br>&emsp;This does not seem to reflect a true course of living. If we remove drama and narratives, then
                        we
                        realize that much of which happens in life is duly so from the weighing nature of existence. "It was no
                        tyranny that made food a challenge to reach." Even if there are poor characters, our ignornace generally
                        accomdates to much room for simplfiying such an impression into a characture. It is more true that
                        effects
                        in life are from the ordinary buisness of living. And all the change that has occured, happens inch by
                        inch,
                        almost imperceptible. Even upon great insight, the novelty is mixed in with the massive norm. And so it
                        is
                        quite hard to say how a difference is made. "Our criticisms of those who we deem the cause of certain
                        effects, feels more like the fruits of intellectualism, broad concepts, and an ignorance of the complete
                        domain of the past."
                        <br>&emsp;I don't mean to say that there isn't something wrong, or that there aren't people producing
                        this.
                        Nor do I deny the prescence of evil, 'or actions which are of such'. But I don't beleive our admittence
                        of
                        this rests on a knife point; and as such, I don't see our amends, or regards rather, as being totally
                        towards a world in need of saving, and our according amend, or one which is simply stuck in the ordinary
                        sway of things. There is room for change. And perhaps even moreso due to the advent of communication.
                        But
                        the fundementals are all that shift. And it is a rather juvenile oversight to think that the motions of
                        the
                        public, who perhaps tilt such fundmenetals, is in itself a direct and crucial cause. It may be the
                        means, or
                        at least way of faciliation; but to the thing which produces impact. And everyone talking about this or
                        that, is more often than not chit and chatter, 'added to the immense bin of talk'. As such, there is
                        much
                        motion, but not with any real fortitude or resolve. "The advent of modernity is in it's freedom and
                        ability
                        to make change. But the virtue required, or quality exhibtied through maturity, is some sort of form, a
                        basis for your direction." In the common tongue, where arguments are given less favor for broader sense
                        and
                        appeal, we are left with the choice of a person, to mould themselves more particularly and definite, or
                        to
                        be more general, in inquiry for instance, but less cemented --albeit tender and strong.

                        When I look at our interests, to share things, spread messages, make an impact, I see that the real
                        impetus
                        is of cultivating our interest. For instance, graphics excite me, yet I can speak of them little. And I
                        dream of being able to remark about how well things look (or not); and this is usually through the form
                        of
                        analyis or common discussion. But the reasonable thing to believe, is that this conception is really in
                        service of you being able to see something better your self. "As opposed to caring whther or not someone
                        else sees it." And, the most important aspect, is taht of the potenial in life, for change and fame,
                        impact
                        and or advancemnt, that it is done so for the progess you actually make; which is in a state which you
                        are
                        sharing or furthering (while unseen): it is not though, marked upon, by whether other people are aware
                        and
                        or care that you know. "It is not about us being seen."
                        <br>&emsp;Out of interest, there may be reason to share you insights about games, as in many things. But
                        it
                        is not at all essential that we do. "Most of the results here are about people making decisiosn about
                        purchaisng; which they are already at liberty to do." It is in environmental and or civil concerns which
                        anyone with a broad interest is bound to. And ultiamtley I think we are wrong to ignore this; but merely
                        heed it as it deems us to be, which is being a part of things, moving on.
                        <br>&emsp;The thing in life to do, is truly be able, 'in that you are not in motion by drunken decree,
                        or
                        yearning haste, but a dear and steady hand'. And as this requires something, beyond that which yields
                        something pecuniary. In many ways, the difference we've made in our life is the object of our
                        foundations,
                        the purpose of our aims. If we were more aligned to this, then the mean would seem simple, and we would
                        not
                        feel thrown about and or idle.

                        There is a bit of peace in me. I reflect on the fact, that our whole life all I sought was that childish
                        delight, the freedom to be, the abscence of chores and duty. A great deal fell within this, in school
                        even.
                        But we've never been one to work or do things of the sort; without the feeling that something fun and
                        pleasurable was coming afterword.
                        <br>&emsp;There is much to say here, but I will move on with the notion of reason, and how she garnishes
                        me
                        with a sort of trust in things; for she details what were to oblige, and how to abide; and the strenght
                        in
                        this makes for a great deal of constancy. Work and family have evened themselvs out in this way, as
                        have,
                        until recently, far off and novel things, such as friends, pals and romance to some extent. Even the
                        idea of
                        sending emails and correspondance: the moral is that you may simply try.

                        So, in tandum with our rowing process, we be pleased to speak as were right to for each and every day.
                        <br>&emsp;The first remark is of exercise. We have done a brief workout following our shift on Thursday,
                        then another heftier one a few days following (and 3 days ago, on sunday I believe). I am only now
                        feeling
                        my body relieve itself. Yoga keeps our form statured, and so depsite our work not bearning us 'formative
                        resitance', it still adds an overall materail to our strucutre and system: for which yoga refurbishes
                        and or
                        moulds. Still, we need to do pushups and squats, and some pulling to. Though, my feeling is we'd be so
                        much
                        better to run more often, do some concentrated work from time to time ---and hopefully to a fairer
                        degree,
                        upon our being consistent--- and then, as our ability grows, incorporate more strenght into our
                        aerobics. Of
                        that, our need for yoga is two fold: accesibility and the sessions. I'm finding great respite in editing
                        the
                        videos as they are, and leaving compositions for strict interest; such as lift training. Otherwise,
                        letting
                        things be releives alot of stress, and points me to a plethora of mateiral, for which I polish and
                        shine.
                        The '30 days' series is a great resource of rthis, and there is no limit as far as I can tell. "There is
                        benefit from the director, whose put these things together. And you can remove some superfluous parts,
                        or
                        lengthen ceratin things. But the flow remains, and your creatvity is in making what is good better,
                        rather
                        than deconstructing it all, for a select few perfections." It seems best then, that we'd make a website.
                        It
                        seems that you get a free domain from github, and host it as we do with PlutarchHumeGreen. We can then
                        show
                        pictures, and arrange them; even if there are many. This will pair greatly with our editive interest.
                        Perfection was fine, but liited, in that you needed further adjsutments; and things which were not in
                        fact
                        great were abanodoend. While tailoring what's there reatins the strenght present. Which, by our limit of
                        effort, and overal care for the lot, makes for more abudnacnea and variety; which gives each session
                        room to
                        breathe. Your favorites become known and acquainted, but withotu relying on them to be so; and so other
                        things can, for interest, circumstance or novelty, be tried.

                        A few quick things. Work seems full of oppertunity, in that we can pick up shifts, get rid of shifts;
                        and
                        thus, switch to anytime. I consent to the fact, that on our course in life, we will have to adjust to
                        the
                        nature of a long shift. I reckon that it is two shifts in one ---and thus as such for time. You simply
                        work,
                        eat properly, and take your two breaks and lunch as to accomdate the double nature.
                        <br>&emsp;At any rate, we've picked up a shift now, have a good in with Teresa, and are generally on the
                        up
                        when it comes to work sentiment, effort and income. As such, I've decided to buy our scooter. I am not
                        spending the 100 to repair the VMAX. It has been several weeks since the repair; though I do suspect its
                        worth caution. In any case, we have new strips, new valves --which has removed all the leaking-- and we
                        may
                        buy more glue if need be. And so a solid tire scooter it is. It's got 750w power, which is fine for
                        coming
                        up the far end of harris --and there's literally no hills. Max speed is 22mph, which is suitable, as we
                        seldom reached full 24 on the Vmax, nor ought we have. And the battery is better contained --or
                        comparable
                        at that. The battery is a 360, like the first scooter we had, comapred to our current 600. I reckon we
                        only
                        use 2/3 of that one, and are too hesitant to recharge. For common things, the 360 is more than suitable.
                        Its
                        long haul is shorter; and considering the solid tire permitts this, theres a bit of a shame. But there
                        is
                        still a great distance. One which is never exhausted locally, and seldom more than what we can more than
                        reasonably achieve. And we may not be able to use it's stability in the furthest sense, but a good
                        amount no
                        less. We can surely go from one side of Burnaby to the other, or around Poco, or langley --using buses
                        to
                        get there, and around even. If we want to do that, or go into the farm lands, or into ridge, or out at
                        night
                        peacefully, we'll use this Jaison. Otherwise, around and to work, the VMAX lies.
                        <br>&emsp;On a quick note, I find much grace in our focus, and thus seek little to be 'I was gonna say'
                        guy.
                        I do find it hard to relate and or connect with people. We have a friendly and cordial relationship with
                        Andy, and broader one with Alex, and respectfull one with Teresa, and similr sorts for Josh, Chenoya and
                        Reza. But Bella and I communicate little. I don't know what to say. I hear she coaches baseball, but
                        were
                        not together for it to come up. I felt a bit more spoken with her today, but nothing past courtesy
                        chatting.
                        I feel when she's there I can partake in the conversation, as she is much more open to Andy and Alex
                        (for
                        instance). Saying her name, hi as we walk by is a basic. Asking questions, when your alone. But don't
                        force
                        it. If your picking, and stop together, just bring up something about the shift, or what your doing.
                        Don't
                        resort to gossip or things made for the sake of conversation. Just bring up something about hers or your
                        day; and speak about how good or bad the weather is. Ask her about baseball, when its over.

                        I'll focus on two things: the need to eat early, and the effect of overly forming our principle.
                        <br>&emsp;For the latter, I mean that, if our nature, or principle, is not bearing us vibrance or
                        strenght,
                        we may tailor our actions to iron this out. What tends to happen is that we overly push ourselves,
                        namely in
                        strenght. As a result, it is as if our normal form is drooping in certain spots, so we try and tighten
                        those
                        areas; but in the process tighten other areas which needed nothing. Something which comes to mind is our
                        ability to push and pull, and how our general rigor in our back and shoulders permitts us to do so fully
                        and
                        true. If that is lacking, it is readily apparent that using said pushing and pulling to instate stature
                        is a
                        rugged afair. "The end being one where our stability is more like crookedness, and thus we can push and
                        pull
                        even less: or risk even further crookedness."
                        <br>&emsp;As for the former, regarding food, it is not an issue to me that we'd eat more later on, but
                        rather eat sooner in the day. Simply, if we are working early, then there is no reason to wait till the
                        evening. If were starting work late, then we ought have some early form of lunch --be it apples,
                        cucumbers,
                        trailmix etc. And if we don't work at all, with the normal use of ruffage to smoothie --which we may
                        include
                        trailmix as well-- onto starch and grain. To note, if we mean to have a moment of higher calorie, this
                        does
                        not mean that were trying to find another food which we'll eat on a regular basis. We may judge our
                        circumstance, in terms of things occured and to come, the matter of wholeness and sweetness. I am
                        thinking
                        that crackers, peanut butter and nutella would make a relatively whole form of such calorie. Bread
                        remains a
                        good thing, but is better suited for higher metabolic periods. At any rate, soft breads fit well in such
                        times, while full ones make do in lesser ones. You may enjoy both in the best of moments, but in our
                        current
                        scenario, stick to english muffins --which go great with PB n J-- Silver Hills, or Pita --which you can
                        cut
                        up, preheat(properly), then lightly fry. Further --and this is a loose thought-- making it easier to
                        consume
                        grain seems paramount, as it is nourishing and filling. Be it with margarine, tomato sauce or butter
                        chicken, soup even, ought we make an effort to include this.

                        I have some reflections regarding health; with the aim of stearing our baser principles.
                        <br>&emsp;For one, we've been inconsistent. Through circumstance sure, and a bit of self-doubt. But more
                        or
                        less, we've been uneven. As far back as I can remember actually. And in fact, ever since we've started
                        doing
                        body weight movements, our regularity has been off. For the aim of such motions has been to strengthen
                        our
                        shoulders and give us rigor and ease. But our physical appearence loses it's brevity, and so we 'move'
                        impertenitly. Since we've sat on the floor this slope has only continued to look down. I can point out a
                        bevy of periods, or stretches at least, where things were well, and our body was solid and swell. So
                        much
                        time though has been spent not working out or doing yoga. Looking back at Vancouver, we did do some
                        running
                        and training, but it was not for long, nor with much grace. I did not feel this cruddiness that I'm
                        experiencing now. But that may be because our overall training was much higher. For regularity is about
                        the
                        pitch of your constance. For we may over the course of several months remain inhabited to exercise, but
                        do
                        so with ill-regularity; in that we do a couple here, then wait a week, 'out of mistakes and or neglect'
                        then
                        do it again. While in the recent years, many weeks may go by where we do nothing, and too many months
                        where
                        this sort of thing is common.
                        <br>&emsp;Right now, my fairest observation is that, of all things range of motion, that my body
                        relsihes
                        having done them. But not so much of what doing them produces, 'as if a sear upon hitting a hot pan';
                        but
                        rather, in memory, as if some felt effect, that they are done for this to still be experienced. There is
                        this point where the form of things whithers away. It comes quick and is hard to revert. But it takes
                        time
                        for this moment to come about; when it does, I shoudl clarify, is when it comes to be so quickly.
                        <br>&emsp;Our ways have always been like this, but I can speak to the proportions of things much better.
                        Namely, your training is usually of bouts amidst your free range or running; or sets and or rounds of
                        strict
                        motions. Doing this latter with no foundation for the former, creates the rigid experience that were
                        feeling
                        to often. For upon that heartier sequence, we don't have any susbquent lighter and or dynamic
                        experience;
                        and so the effects of the resitance training sink deeper into me, but unevenly. From the fact that we
                        sit on
                        the floor, our being as such gets twisted and thwarted, to the effect that we are bearing ourselves to
                        be
                        upright and comfortable. Yoga fortifies you against this, and, through the course of the day, 'while the
                        more permanent effects haven't set in, that so does it even out the dripping effect of gripping. "In
                        other
                        words, we grip less, and are thwarted less from as much as we do." But the downward pull, or drip, is
                        from
                        our approach of training, and how commiserate it is to prior and or coming sessions, along with work,
                        and
                        our balance of eating. Which, of the latter, is to say, that exercising on a parched stomach can create
                        it's
                        own rigid position, as your body tends to be less ample and light during heartier mtoions. And, by those
                        other imbalances, doing such motions in such a way is what brings a sort of heaviness upon us --which
                        our
                        relation to the floor and yoga bears. But, having eaten little, we may be a earn some heaviness, as does
                        doing work or playing games to excess following training. "Though this actually intrudes upon the
                        incorporation of the heaviness already produced, rather that contirbuting more." Work, in being
                        excessively
                        dynamic, with a flavor of rigor and also intersperes akwardness, is weakened the most by too little
                        nourishment.

                        So, briefly, the idea that your liver stores glycogen, seems like the key to our success; and also
                        reason
                        for our demise. Metabolically, you use some balance of sugar, fat and oxygen. I reckon, by being
                        catabolic,
                        unworked, that you use these inappropriately; moreover, you don't intake them as much; for the sugar can
                        be
                        put into muscles, or liver ---which, in being of excess, may rmeark that dry mouth, where the sugar has
                        no
                        place to go.
                        <br>&emsp;Another thing, is that arugments, perhaps neccesarrily, work from some principle. A theory is
                        a
                        broader statement, as it takes certain facts and or principles for granted. Of note, is that you may
                        speak
                        to something less than entirety, and bear facts and or principles with respect to that. For, I may not
                        be
                        able to speak to entirety, but still take for granted a principle which is more sound and local to a
                        'upper
                        matter'. "This is how, despite lacking knowledge of cause and effect, that we can still speak about
                        ovens as
                        if their proported effect of cooking is true; perhaps on a given belief from experience, or, induction,
                        as
                        such epxeirence have given merrit through what you've observed repeatedly. But, the point, is not that
                        were
                        contending the nature of the oven; as this rests on their being cause and effect at all. But, as we may
                        take
                        for granted certain principles or truths to exclaim cause and effect, so are we taking the nature of the
                        oven (to cook) to be true, and from that given fact, making claims and or statements about what were
                        going
                        to do (with cooking)."
                        <br>&emsp;Thirdly, I see too much potential in setting up our PWA. Our website is one thing, but setting
                        up
                        a scripted PDF has too much value, as you can change font, color, size etc. but also have little boxes
                        for
                        designation. You could pin something as being about family and the past, or violence, religion,
                        philosophy,
                        judgement and or thinking. Everything may be put somewhere. You may also favorite and or star things, as
                        to
                        be deemed essnetial, worth a re-read, and even edit. Practically, you can have a little button above
                        each
                        piece, and let that toggle a little bar, full of boxes which you check. All we need to do content wise,
                        is
                        put everything within tags, put the toggle bar, and bobs your uncle. I did find, from VS purely, that we
                        beenfited by putting 'notes' --which are things about work and or eating, which are not worth reading--
                        in
                        their own file. And indeed, keeping these hear in our PWA list, may ruin some of the flow; which tends
                        to
                        happen, or has at least, when going over a piece onto the next. Though, the primary cause of this is in
                        the
                        act of scrolling, and needing to be caught by something, rather than imparting your interest, which all
                        things apply. Directing the 'notes' to their place, and then reading them or not, 'as everything being
                        ordered gives a semblence of, 'why not'',' may make things work smoothly, without the need of a prior
                        pass
                        --to put such notes in their own list.

                        So a quick remark of our leisuruley finance. Scooter is coming, and old one is good for a patch. This
                        has
                        used much of our spending money; as there is much joy and utility in being able to ride, and on these
                        solid
                        tires.
                        <br>&emsp;Our computer is generally off. It seemed to have been fixed by undervolting; but launching
                        Aliens
                        reset it. Only once mind you; and I do recall this happening with Starfield. We'll try launching it more
                        times --we've got the new driver. The maple ridge guy said he'd service it for free (to diagnose);
                        though, I
                        can't imagine there is any usesfull information besides needing an upgrade. We may look into setting
                        games/clients for gpu usage. We may also understadnd undervolting and min. frequevcny, and whether these
                        change per games.
                        <br>&emsp;I will be a little sad if Red Dead can't be played. But alas, Ark is on PS5 and all mighty for
                        it.
                        BF1 remains a humbling classic, as is 4 and 5 a common good. There appears less online we can play with
                        Matt, but alas, Ark and BF are there. Diablo is kind of an indulgence; and wasn't an issue with
                        undervolting. Borderlands 4 comes early Septemebr, and Battleifeld a few weeks after that, on PS5. Our
                        pc
                        functions fine besides that. Similar to our scooter, if we find the interest, we'll put a 100$ in cede
                        the
                        issue; but otherwise, make use of it as we good and fit. Andor season 1 is prime, as is Rogue One.
                        Conferences are coming next week, along with Ragnorak --which i cannot wait to play on official servers.
                        We
                        have tons of games on PS5, namely Jurassic Evolution, Aliens, Jedi Survivor on ps extra, doom, and
                        honestly,
                        a bunch of other cool games, Ghost of Tushima director cut, more Fallout 76 (which wasn't too good
                        online,
                        but great for me, exploring,), need for speed hot pursuit (which, again, is like one of those things
                        which
                        is cool to download because you own it, and play a bit), and mafia similar to that, dead space,
                        collisto,
                        little nightmares (which is suppose to be easy and fun), Tombraider (which we've been meaning to play)

                        I tried to gain administrative access to windows apps. I switched the __ to my name, as adminsitrator
                        ---my
                        name was listed by several things, one being adminsitrator-- then I applied this to all __sub fields. I
                        still coun;dnt access windows apps, but when I did this, I was prompted upon launching an xbox pc game
                        and
                        red dead 2 (pc) that firewall needed access. These sort of prompts come up for msot games, but this
                        seemed a
                        little different. Normally, prior to the game booting up, the prompt comes up, but these prompts came at
                        the
                        games main menu. When I was in red dead, the screen turned green. I control alt dleted to task maanger,
                        and
                        on the windows deskptop, the screen was flashing. I went back to red dead, all was fine, then I alt

                        I'm a bit overwhelmed with the prospect of problem solving; what I am never tired for, is in embalming
                        myself with the guide of reason.
                        <br>&emsp;I may be discontent about our pc, 'acting up again'. Nor am I terribly proud, or at least
                        assured,
                        in our purchase of another scooter; and speaking about it is often unbecoming our reasoning for doing
                        so.
                        <br>&emsp;But of this dissuasion, we need not fret. Yes the problem remains, but, beyond the fact that
                        you
                        can bear it, so can you more readily adopt an appreciation for all else that you have. "Only children
                        pout
                        and cry when one of their toys break, forgetting that they have so much other."
                        <br>&emsp;All things console are free and pure. Even if the 5 broke, we have a ps4 --and this would be
                        relataively cheap to replace. Ark is played better on console, for it is easy to boot up; and it being
                        ascended --which has natural struggles on pc-- makes for the best experience. Red Dead may or may not
                        work,
                        so be it. I will let it sit there as a marvel to come. A bit far away, but a remaster may come for
                        console.
                        And despite lacking mods, you could still play console; and give emphasis to the story. Or take your
                        hunting
                        seriously. Theres some time and place to do that. There is more or less a laundry list of games. Bf 1
                        remains true, 2042 is novel and fun, and 5 and 4 compare. Soon, Borderlands and Bf6 will be out. And
                        Matt
                        finds an easy interest in games, so were going to play Borderlands 1 --which will be fun and
                        delightfull,
                        and perhaps worth another investment into 2. As it were, Civ is no longer an interest: were full on it.
                        And
                        diablo is a bit of an indulgence, and not something which I care too much about. Forget about the event:
                        Ragnorak is coming. And the next season many weeks away.
                        <br>&emsp;I would find much delight to eat well and enough tomorrow; to do a morning stretch, breifly
                        standing and the table to down dog. Working on the reamining videos would marble our day. If we have
                        time,
                        I'd like to workshop the PWA. And there is much to easily read from our current charter. Mammals is
                        almost
                        done: and I am so glad to have gotten even a bit more out of this fantastic soundtrack. "Heists, Whale
                        Nursery and Master of Heat being great additions." I am looking to move onto Planet Earth 3, and with
                        mammals, look for some slow downs, or speed ups. The key is continuity, as connecting different paces is
                        off. Master of Heat for instance simply sounds good at all lower levels; while there are short bits
                        which
                        bear more value in being extended. "Similar to Mammals title." I'd say were in the red zone with our
                        scooter; but we may take it easily down Ford or Harris, and to Pitt. Come straight at the bumps, and go
                        slow
                        over the two divets near Hammond ---which I would take, for PMSS is quite gruddy.

                        I don't want this to be false advertisign, as this scooter does indeed go 40km/24mph, has 600wh battery,

                        IPX6 and only 46lbs. But it is old. It's god 3500km on it, has had a new rear tire on the back. Its got
                        a
                        scratch or two, but not much else worth noting. I am selling because I mean to get a smaller scooter
                        with
                        solid tires. This one has tubeless; which is fine in it's own right, but I have wanted to avoid any
                        puncture
                        concern.

                        I've been thinking for a while about this idea of formation, or moulding substance. By that, I wonder
                        what
                        it means for us, to mould ourselves through writing, even if our current state is one of weariness and
                        rigidity. "Tis some rough clay."
                        <br>&emsp;At any rate, I see clearly that the lifts video is hard to come by. I have no problem
                        blending,
                        nor doing a bit of prep, in terms of how to start and begin. Its nature is to form our lifts, and so,
                        how it
                        begins and ends is not an issue. I'll bring in another point, that I sought to do some editing today,
                        and
                        despite doing so, I am not compelled to do a ton. From that, I see the value in things just being what
                        they
                        are, and being complete as they can be; without over doing ourselves. Lifts can come tomorrow or
                        Wedensday
                        --which is itself a great day, considering its relation to now-- but until then, and even when that more
                        concentrated moment happens, just let the video be, suitable in its form, and subject to later editing,
                        or
                        reconstruction: but from a known sort.
                        <br>&emsp;Tomorrow, or the day next, were going to do a mighty pushup session. Were modifying the pose
                        as to
                        do more; namely in lowering to our knees. Volume is the anwser, especially in or lower degree. For the
                        session, my sense is that four doubles is possible. Drop onto your knees, push, come up and rest, then
                        drop
                        again, then recover, drop, pause and drop again: this is your superset ---which is to say, two doubles.
                        From
                        here, recovery and recuperate, then repeat. The point is to keep your form, do lots of repitions, but
                        not
                        grind through your elbows or shoulders. TableDog is a great monring video, as are easyHero and
                        proneSupine
                        nice additions throughout the day. FullBack and SupineStaff are more tertiary, and likely in the midday
                        when
                        you need to rest; while cowCobble is pretty solid for firm and upright recovery; while HeroFeet is
                        pretty
                        good for restoring yourself (as you mend your feet). As of now, besides our lifts and flows, we'd gain
                        much
                        from a leg session; namely of runners lung, quad stretch, and some other hip and or staff work. We'd
                        benefit
                        much from arms and neck stretches; particularly in order to recover from work or training. And albeit
                        great
                        for the monring, a pure standing and or folding sequence would compliment tableDog. I'm thinking an arm
                        swooshing flow, up and down several times, ending with a longer hold and rise --- the end of tabledog
                        has
                        that lovely arm cross and stretch, which is great for all endings.

                        So, I can't speak to all things, but, I have seen that there is a clear point in the day where the sun
                        is
                        relatively high, but a bit dipped, yet still prior to evening. There is a warm glow to things, yet full
                        on
                        shine. This, more or less, is the afternoon; and the later you can wait, the richer it gets.
                        <br>&emsp;I am aware though that this sort of thing only comes in the middle portion of the year; as
                        during
                        the shorter months, the sun goes quickly from midday to evening. In terms of time, one can go out at
                        5pm,
                        and still come back, rest and have dinner, then go back out for a 9pm sunset. At least, the evening glow
                        is
                        around that; and too, the dark blue around 10. I think that we can take our scooter on the road, and
                        mitigate any night riding concerns. We do this generally around pitt, so why not down harris and old
                        dewdney. Grab your lights, and be aware of cars behind. There ought not be many, and its a quick moment
                        to
                        old dewdney and another to the farm road. Then its full on brilliance. It isn't much less to go down
                        ford
                        and mctavish. It lacks the western view, but is quite open above, and more than fine for the east.

                        I don't take pleasure in having to stear our direction. We had sent our mom and dad a letter, exclaiming
                        the
                        need for health. This remains true; but what we had in mind there, has shifted. I feel the beenfit from
                        working out concentradely; and I also see how it is permissable through yoga. But I don't feel great.
                        Nor do
                        I think this entirely from our shortcomings of yoga. Were too absent of aerobics and free range. Yes,
                        our
                        stability would serve us, as would more restoration. But to the end that, upon our workout, we would be
                        more
                        able to do nothing, 'as it bade us do'.
                        <br>&emsp;What needs to happen is that we need to prioritize that primary motion of the day; be it
                        warrior,
                        deep stretch, free range and or a mix of aerobics, or full range. Of the latter, it is clear that you
                        benefit from volume; and this can be achieved by altering your position. Knee pushups are a clear
                        example.
                        Side squats are great, as you adjust your footing each time. Pulling though remains a mystery; for it is
                        generally tougher, and hard to adjust. It is paramount then, that you use proper gloves (if needed) and
                        have
                        the proper footing to begin your motion. Otherwise, let your restoration and stability bring you through
                        the
                        days, and free range and aerobics give life to this. Do your pushups and squats in tandum with that, and
                        in
                        a way that is proper for them. We ought do some lifts at any rate; and our judgement of proper pushing
                        may
                        bound from that.

                        Here are the facts as I know them.
                        <br>&emsp;Having someone put a single tubeless tire on is 50$, 100$ for solid. The cost of each tire is
                        around 50$.
                        <br>&emsp;From VMAX, the guarteneed proper tire is that price, but is literally 70$ to ship. And that is
                        american, so its more like 130 x 1.3 = 180. Which is ridiculous. I've emailed them, and they may or may
                        not
                        give me a discount for the tire (a coupon, as they've offered before). But near 100$ cad to ship it is
                        absurd, and makes this not much of an option.
                        <br>&emsp;Also, putting a solid tire on my scooter has always unnerved me. Mostly because the fit of it
                        may
                        be off. They have some with the right dimensions --from Amazaon, they have no solids from VMAX. But the
                        thickness of it worries me. And its 150$, and still leaves the front tire unsolid. The value of solids
                        is
                        you can go out at night without concern; and the same down more precarious roads, or to other cities. If
                        I
                        still have a non solid up front, then having one in the back doesn't mean much. I might as well have non
                        solid for both, and ride with respect to that.
                        <br>&emsp;This leaves me then with the possibility that the rim is damaged, which makes any tire
                        unusable.
                        Or, we do as you say and put a tube in there. This brings a huge issue with it though, in that, if it
                        gets
                        popped, you have to get someone to take it off and put it back on so you can patch it up. If the bead
                        was
                        properly seated, I would just rely on plugs. Maybe the tube is protected from smaller punctures, and is
                        thus
                        not an issue.
                        <br>&emsp;Also, about rounded tires, the one's from vmax are the same as the one I bought: flat. The
                        tire I
                        had looked as flat as mine does now (when it did not have air). I see on Amazon that there are such
                        tires
                        which look rounded; I just don't see how my old one was such, and thus, I don't think the tire was an
                        issue.
                        I don't see how it being roudned or not determines if it fits on the rim properly. Even if it does, this
                        new
                        one didn't seem to fit improperly but for that one spot. And the issue there may be chocked up to damage
                        on
                        the rim.
                        <br>&emsp;In terms of new scooters, I see that the 400$ is more than I even need. I can get one for 300
                        that
                        goes slightly less fast, has a smaller battery, but is similar otherwise. There's value in that battery
                        though. At any rate, having solid tires has good value, period. I am totally on board for selling
                        scooter,
                        but the tire must be fixed. If the rim is damaged, then theres nothing to be done. If the tire was the
                        issue, maybe it can be adjusted; or I'll have to look into a proper tire.

                        I ordered a e scooter recently. Its performance has been relatively sub par. I've only ridden it once,
                        but
                        it did not go as fast as advertised. I was looking through the user manual though, and it mentioned that
                        to
                        be eligble for a return, there could be no more than 10 miles on the odometer. For one, you can't see
                        the
                        odmoeter. But, my question to you, is such a qualification applicable if I am returning it to amazon.
                        The
                        product is not sold through amazon mind you; though I have been reassuered (in prior conversations) that
                        Amazon will reinburse me for any return costs (issued by the seller). Which, to be clear, is on Amazon,
                        but
                        sold/shipped from another seller. I am just unclear whether that fact about ridig it to a limited extent
                        applies in said sellers return process (in relation to Amazon). As it may only apply if you bought the
                        product through their own website.
                        <br>&emsp;Here is a link to the product:

                        So the hero session served me well, but has been set aside into the realm of full back and supine. The
                        reason being, that the staff pose and leg raise remove it as a sort of 'quick sesh'.
                        <br>&emsp;On that note, I would seperate our sessions into those which you do on a whim, likely for the
                        interest of unwinding and or breathing. Easy Hero or Cobbler come to mind; things which you could do as
                        many
                        times during the day; and with not stakes but for the result of doing them. Others are of a more
                        deliberate
                        sort. These are you supines and or deep stretches; things you may in all fairness elect to do, but more
                        than
                        liely end up being things for when you have nothign but thus wish for somethign large; or there more
                        particularly made, and done so with a certain end in mind, such as lifts or neck stretch.
                        <br>&emsp;By the advent of our system, we need not worry about classifying things. Certain ones do get
                        put
                        into that less than often side, but we recall where they are, all while they sit there accessible and
                        clear
                        if and when we want them.
                        <br>&emsp;Most things need a trimming or edit. Hero for instance, would be fine if it weren't for leg
                        raise.
                        Prone and supine are fairly swell, but the object of the pairing is not fully realized; the prone should
                        be
                        slightly simpler, and the supine should more easily become so. TableDog is a prime example here, as I
                        don't
                        think it beenfits from two rounds of downward dog. Its better to shorten the intial table top, maybe
                        join in
                        some motion, then go to dowanrd dog and prone --let it be that though. You may add a proper rise, or
                        just
                        leave this for what it is, as a sort of easy shoulder/lift session, and build a proper standing routine.
                        HeroFeet is similar, in that it is structurally swell, but could be trimmed down. FullBack needs a
                        section
                        removed, as is supineStaff untended. These ought have crucial matters tended to; but for all their
                        worth,
                        they sit nicely as a basis for us, when we have nothing but little to do.
                        <br>&emsp;I will note the essential edits of mere flow and sun salutation. Getting to them would be
                        preferred in the latter, and lengthening the time in lunges for the former. Also, in each, give time for
                        proper pauses during folds and rises; and give a generous hold near the end.
                        <br>&emsp;Besides that, the two easiest sessions are mountain and squating. For the latter, I think it
                        would
                        be so beneficial to hold three deep squats. We can use any channel; perhaps some indian. We may do it
                        often
                        and simply. For moutnain, I want a more active rise, beginning with several arm raises, then into fold,
                        with
                        a deep hold, then up again firmly, with arm stretches and things of the sort. I realize there is not
                        alot of
                        actual folding, but I prefer the motion on both ends than the actual drop or rise.
                        <br>&emsp;Lifts might be our most wortwhile and custom job. How we begin may be simple, as we have
                        nothing
                        but bold intentions. Though a version of this that is akin to flow, in that you may want to breezily do
                        this, compared to a more lengthy and deliberate session. The aim is not so much to hold things, as this
                        can
                        be difficult, buy rather to go through the chaturanga movement several times. I dare say, that a full
                        session would include a pause and rest, and into another round, ended with cobbler. Lifts are amongst
                        our
                        weakest points, and effect our ability to work and train. So having an easy and serious session is
                        paramount

                        People worry about you, and perhaps for good reason. But, of the things relevant to me, or important
                        rather
                        within such judgement, so is this often poorly respected.
                        <br>&emsp;All I'll say, is of my problems, it comes down to the merriment of good pace, contrasted with
                        the
                        opposite begruderies and glimmness, as comes from a poor pace.
                        <br>&emsp;As regards my choices in life, so that our pace, be it full or flat, has some end, or
                        direction in
                        mind, so is this ultiamtley my own. And it is not poor to mention that the nature of our pace effects
                        this;
                        as being idle tends not to produce future thought.
                        <br>&emsp;At any rate, my scooter is in perril. But, in effect, we are on route to fixing it and making
                        it
                        amiable. The primary concern is in fact our Jaison scooter, as the return is not endeliably acceptable.
                        I do
                        mean to keep the large matt, but the blue one must be returned prior to the fifht --which is coming up.
                        Our
                        credit card situation is more or less an issue, but only because we are more accountable for what we
                        buy. If
                        dad pays for the scooter, then we'll accept the amazon mistake. Otherwise, we'll ask for comupins.

                        Nor, in
                        doing so, are they benefiting much; as living like kids do is not much of avenue for great living.
                        Moreover,
                        your actually hurting yourself; for it is not reasonable, in what you plainly desire, to be without
                        social
                        interaction. Worth noting is the fact that most people are not given such provisions and thus employ
                        themselves, with desires and cares rooted by that. And as such, many of the folk who you would convene
                        with,
                        will be uncomparable to you, in that you are not employed.
                        <br>&emsp;But when we come down to it, it is never ok to live as a child, even if your needs are met. My
                        experience doing so has been one where, in claiming so, that it was such because of our behaviour and
                        choices. For we were not thwarted in being provided for if we behaved well, and lived un-vain. Further
                        though, we perosnally came to see that, with all being provided, that we still lacked friends and
                        occupation. Employing ourselves then, when there was no pecuniary need, still provided something we felt
                        was
                        absent. The question then, is how much ought one do if they are given privalage. For in fairness, all
                        motives for this concern come from some view of the future and how, as in all actions, what the effect
                        will
                        be when the future becomes now. Out of desire and need, and perhaps discipline as to exhort this --by
                        those
                        who'd otherwise provide-- you are more or less going to be on your own, providing for youself. And so,
                        in
                        being given things now, you are not well fit for such life since the actions imbued to it are barren
                        now.
                        There is a sentiment of 'feeling the burden', as if the work you did had stakes; along with the sense of
                        apprectiation of things, when such work is required. But I believe this senitment false, and lives
                        beyond
                        the our main point. Which is, in what you can expect, and how those who provide also look out for the
                        fact
                        that such deeds will be yours, that it is only fair that such privalge be given rightly, if such future
                        is
                        not tarnished in the process. "We ought be as we would without privalge, so what is given is not at the
                        cost
                        of inability upon it lacking."
                        <br>&emsp;The point then, is that we have moved to Pitt Meadows and are employed at Superstore. Our
                        leisure
                        is constrained to our bedroom walls and our relations with people is merely college like. But our angst
                        about speaking is gone. "I've noticed more of an issue with my eyes; from poor cardio potentially." I
                        care
                        not to move, in the way that I did before, with exotic envy and or fear, 'of living here, being normal,
                        ceasing our quest for posterity and fame'. Despite our health being a little poor in the aerobics, our
                        yoga
                        has never been better, as has our general movement been fine. Were just a bit to head down in our own
                        efforts, 'letting the more filled out position come later'.

                        On a practical note, I am trying to make a pdf website, or editing browser, so that I may input my
                        writings,
                        and cateogrize them as special or of a certain kind --philo, life, reflections, joy, world-- and also
                        give
                        them a name. It would be so great if we could use notepad to wrap each piece in proper text, then have
                        an
                        input box which would make that piece's id labelled as I input. Perhaps it will just save the title, and
                        we'll have to input it manually; which is as simple as 'finding' said spot, and pasting the title there
                        into
                        the div. It might be worth noting, that all of these notes are best put at the end of a piece, seeing as
                        you
                        are going to judge following reading. But, at the top, have a label which shows the title inputed at the
                        bottom.
                        <br>&emsp;It seems the prime course of action is one where a simple modal comes up, and of all the
                        options
                        selected, it does so for the piece in question. I've no solution though to the top bottom question, as
                        there
                        is no way for the modal to know what piece your own, by the mere fact of where you've scrolled to --as
                        that
                        is what the viwer is, a long list of divided text.

                        So, problem wise, our scooter is the main issue. Only practically though; as having to wait costs me
                        nothing; excpet appreciation of what we really need. But our Jaison is a little concerning, as the
                        return is
                        naturally not so smooth. No matter, we have the means to claim, and the cost of return is assuredly
                        covered.
                        <br>&emsp;Our computer is a little finacky. Undervolting seemed to help, and for the most part, playing
                        Civ
                        has not been an issue. Red Dead was, but I am unclear if this was from trying to unlock windows. I
                        reverted
                        this, though similar behavior happened with Aliens and Red Dead. It may be a serious issue, or maybe it
                        was
                        from something else. Witcher may be a problem also, but I see the benefit from playing Ark and Jedi,
                        merely
                        booting them up, that the slight drop in quality is but a minor concern. In many ways, the PS5 version
                        looks
                        good enough --and it is ultiamtley the world which i seek. Similarly, in the case for Red Dead, we could
                        priortize the story; and otherwise roleplay with hunting by treking around the fur traders. We may also
                        minimzie any exhorbident rewards, as to warrant finer efforts.
                        <br>&emsp;Our credit card is techincally charging us 50$ a year. PS remains an indedted fund, similar to
                        Mobile. It is about 5$ to get extra, and Jedi has been more than fine. I wish to find more fun in
                        Descent,
                        but were still learning what to do. Evolution is similar, though the setting is not so gripping.
                        <br>&emsp;Andor remains, as does Clone Wars. Seinfeld perhaps lingers, while Life With Derek is a
                        splendid
                        surprsie, along with Boogie.

                        The two main sessions were missing is standing and legs. For one, I am thinking of the outside vid,
                        where
                        she opens her arms up high several times, then folds ---we can just add that excellent rise and arm
                        stretch.
                        Leg wise, we ought do staff twist and supine stretches. There are many of the former, and the latter
                        needs
                        only formatting. We can also find a resting version of this, where we substitue the staff for prone,
                        then
                        spend more deliberate time on our back. In fact, our current prone supine --which we edited-- needs to
                        upload.
                        <br>&emsp;Were missing a neck stretch. Which is one of those things, where skipping it, makes your
                        coming
                        bounds less ideal; and hard to amend, 'as you've already settled into your mould'. This can be the red
                        pant
                        vid, with hands out followed by rotations. You can also do simple arm raise to twist then fold --while
                        seated-- and do your neck following.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel that our aerobics is lacking. Having a soccerball would be nicest, as it is engaging
                        without being querrky. Jump rope is a bit like that. Skipping is fine, but can be a little loofy.
                        Running in
                        spot is a fair accompaniment; but running feels the best. Give yourself time though to do this, and let
                        your
                        recovery occur from workouts. Doing your stretches alleviates your uneven motion. Without our scooter,
                        we
                        have no other option, but free range at home. Our soccer ball is flat, and jump rope is a bit to
                        awkward.
                        <br>&emsp;Quickly, we might extend our lunges and add a later hold for our mereFlow ---along with giving
                        a
                        fair pause after each fold. This is something easy and done often, which is a benefit while were not
                        doing
                        any full range. Similar to our neck work, in that it better strenghtens the mould to come, so would a
                        more
                        concentrated lift session contribute similar strenght. But for now, legs, neck/seated, standing, updated
                        flow, mereSupine, and uploading our proneSupine, would suffice.

                        I have spent much time remarking upon the Humian notion of mind. I see how there is much in regards to
                        thoughts which we may apply. For our idea of a thought, or sense at least, contains properties which are
                        farily deemed of a real sort. For what gives the material of our thought its form or substance? Is there
                        color, shape or some other quality. Such properties hold within them a physical basis; at least, when
                        were
                        describing things in real life. So why should such elements not be equally remarked upon in our mind.
                        Why we
                        are thinking of colors, and more than likely other propertiees to, is one thing; but it seems true and
                        fair
                        to explain the imagery of such color as one would to it in reality. "Would my concept of mixing blue and
                        yellow not create green?"
                        <br>&emsp;I find that liberty has a retched mother; one who nags him if he is not honest or fair.
                        Simply, we
                        are remissed upon our freedoms to realize that others are not so well off. But the matter of fact is,
                        that
                        when we are in fact solid and true, that we don't get warped into such concepts, and rather let the
                        mystery
                        of other peoples experience be what they may. Consquently, our own calm and tender flow of experience,
                        moulds what we'd imagine the basis for other folks experiences are. "Not that they would receive certain
                        impressions, or be affected rather this or that way; but that, of whatever came in, from ectasy to
                        gratuity,
                        so would it be imparted onto to the vessicle we know: our own mind and fortuity fairs the backdrop by
                        which
                        others will experience things." It is a shame that we often see others at their lowest; or worse, we see
                        something which is in fact novel, or a slight garnish to their otherwise selves, but we then percieve
                        them
                        as that fully: which is a pithy view on our part. It is true that people suffer, be it in poverty or
                        pestulence. But they are people after all; and even if young or foolish, so is there humanity in them.
                        "Not
                        the least of these accolades is the dissimenation of pain, as produced under the victims moral cause.
                        E.g,
                        soldiers who are shot, stabbed, obliterated in the torso or limb, even those executed in strict fashion;
                        so
                        are these men endlessly accounted for as being stout, calm, and despite any enduring pain, fine. 'Not a
                        sound or a whimper', the surgeon said, as she remarked upon the treatment center; literal pieces of
                        shrapnel
                        being pulled out of folks side, and the room was silent. Such are the halls of humanity."
                        <br>&emsp;There is a shiny side of this though. For on route to liberty, there may be an untimely
                        demise, or
                        guarenteed one at that. And this is perhpas the soul thorn in our positive side: for such matters are
                        hard
                        to conceive properly, and thus rightly consiliate. But, aside from such things, 'in the evening of our
                        remorse,' we can exhibit the genuine virtue which removes us personally from such despair. For it is one
                        thing to sympathize amidst other peoples squeels; and another for your own. But such risk, or
                        precariousness
                        in which you may be spurn to such, is one that virtue fortifies one against. As Seneca says, 'those who
                        thrown up their hands, often get them cut off; while the will of man is never immutable from offering
                        his
                        throat: in which his subjection is to times mere demand'. Marbling that concept with the simplest of
                        ease,
                        makes one's entry unremitting, and thus an indeulable option for one who'd choose it --and not, by its
                        defintiion, with any comparable remorse.
                        <br>&emsp;The slowness of life, the rot of imagery which our pithy impressions and judgements produce,
                        balance our sensibilities out when properly considered. And as such, although I may not entirely know
                        their
                        pain and suffering, so am I unprivy to any laudible conception of villany or evil. And as such, people
                        are
                        at worse subject to the trauma of (ordinary) combative operations; and at best, to some extent grazed,
                        or at
                        least unobliterated. "For which many account for in their bouts of bravery, e.g, 'I did not even realize
                        that I'd been hit', or, 'not till some time had gone by did it begin feeling awful'." Most of us would
                        seemingly imagine that it was upon entry that the atrocity happened. But it is more often than not what
                        lingers --rather than what so cerimoiously occured (ie. the hit). It is not worth overlooking the
                        enormous
                        kindness, comradery and more or less geniality between all folk: combatatns or not. To those shattered
                        thighs or perferated bowls, know that there is no God to aid you, but the hands of man: for which there
                        are
                        many on all sides. Moreover, the civil operations surrounding such matters are not filled with anything
                        but
                        gentleman. Their ideas may be archaic and or inflated, but they are men, operating on the day to day
                        correspondances in which their position reflects. "I ought say more, but, more or less, as the
                        beligerents
                        are merely operative by their own national decree, yet are not then of evil and villany, so are those,
                        in
                        perpetration and defense, any more evil or ludicrous: such sentiments pithily reflect the true and
                        continual
                        actions of each and every man. " And we ought blame nature for leading us to modernity from primitive
                        times;
                        where culture and relations could so 'un-modernly' procure.
                        <br>&emsp;I understand war and bigotry then through some antrhopolgical sense. I consiliate myself by
                        rounding off any pitiful and or slack edges. I also impermiate myself from any abscence of mans
                        fidelity:
                        being strictly devout to their actual nature and happening. "I ought clearly knwo and see there true
                        strenght during pain, and their geniality in dealing it." Such sides are but foriegn strides: in history
                        and
                        destination. While I sit here, endeared to death, pleased to meet it, and as such indifferent in
                        distress,
                        nor so gripped and or bethrothed to whatever one may take: I let them take all the things but what I
                        care
                        for; nor do I flinch when I am asked to be a part of their employment. "Time never offered me anything
                        but a
                        delayed corporal blade. As Socrates, 'release me now'."

                        So I don't forget, there is a clear solution for our website. Simply, we need a lower left button which
                        triggers a modal. This modal will speak for whichever piece is loaded; or in the case of our pdf
                        (editing),
                        so will there be a checkbox that, when clicked, marks said div for the modal. This may be applied to
                        present
                        pieces also.
                        <br>&emsp;The modal will have a grand star, as to attribute generaly great pieces, and mild stars, as to
                        attribute great pieces within a section. Such sections will be Philo, as remarks our linens and doubt,
                        the
                        World, as remarks civil exploration and begrudgrment, minor sections such as violence or Civ, Life,
                        which
                        remarks eating and work, and Joy, which holds our sentiment of principle and living. What's more, you
                        can
                        assign a piece to multiple sections. You may have a treatment of joy, but in less reflective manner, but
                        of
                        principle, and this may hold both categories of Philo and Joy. The point being, that instead having a
                        section for 'joy and philo', you simply assign pieces the cateogires that fit them. Then, you may recall
                        pieces that fit those arrangment of categories. It should be though, that, in this pieces case, that
                        because
                        it is in philo and Joy, that it not also be in Philo by itself. Only when you select philo and joy will
                        you
                        see it. Perhaps this may be an option --where you can have all pieces attached to a type, or only those
                        of
                        such type but no other.
                        <br>&emsp;Of note, if your looking for all pieces on Civ, assume you can find them in your files. Copy
                        and
                        paste there Ids --which their titles are already associated with, or would be in the index file. Then
                        put a
                        sign next to this in Notepad, and put each of them in the proper div strucutre --using find and repalce.

                        So I woke up today, and all was generally well. I got to work, taped my screen, and worked rather well
                        through the first two runs. I had some trailmix, then after a short run, went on a break. I failed to
                        eat
                        more after this, and during my next run, I was quite hungry. I ate, and this solved the issue.
                        <br>&emsp;I had ran yesterday, and all was well. But I noticed that my neck was rather straight; and I
                        could
                        feel this during my shift.
                        <br>&emsp;Our sleep was more or less fine, having walked and done some proneSupine. "Our breathing was
                        swell." But I do feel that more sleep is needed. Foremost, is our time during off days, where it is
                        better
                        advised that you go to bed around 11, and strive to wake up around 7. This may naturally change as your
                        shifts happen earlier. But for now, going to bed 7 hours prior, or turning everything off, is fair.
                        Also,
                        make sure everything is done, in terms of prep, so you don't have to come and go and see lights.

                        This idea, of being reaosnable, comes from this inherent sense that were conditioned; and similar to
                        one,
                        who knows there bank account, and however desirable a purcahse would be, they feel rot, 'and perhaps
                        shame',
                        and spending money they did not freely have.
                        <br>&emsp;THis is why virtue is exclaimed as good in itself; for surrounding all of us is some extent of
                        a
                        condition; and thus, as if a flame that never ceased its heat, so are our actions which mend that, 'and
                        for
                        our better', pleasing. "As if we knew the harvest was coming, and were pleased to be on route for good
                        picking."
                        <br>&emsp;In that, I see the relationship with work, and given the basic reason for us being there, so
                        is
                        our conciliation to its labor akin to virtue; in that our actions, as experienced and foreseen, are calm
                        and
                        plenty.
                        <br>&emsp;But on this path, there is a portion of complacency. For I do not see perfection outside our
                        door;
                        but merely a constant progress to that harmony. We know that certain yoga positions would be alright;
                        and
                        that if these were hear, our time gaming would naturally be put aside and returned to in proper amounts.
                        "Of
                        these chains, it is a nice feeling to see that they will feel lighter, and us stronger. These little
                        meddleys of experience which I deam rich, only seem more bright and near, and often."

                        It is reasonable that if we were to sustain ourselves, that we'd pay est. 700, and the remaining on
                        food. We
                        tend to budget, 'by times evening', some 300 for that. I see no reason then why we shouldn't account for
                        things in our current situation equally.
                        <br>&emsp;The purpose of this runs on the fact that we eat a variety of foods. Their prescence need not
                        be
                        constant, but regular. As one thing ceases, the medley of others take its place. "And the regularity
                        allows
                        for enough overlap, as to make every moment sufficeint."
                        <br>&emsp;Milk for instance, is given favor via a single glass. This makes a Silk carton worth a week,
                        and
                        thus 15-20$ a month. This does not count Soy for smoothies; which does not use so much, and can be
                        scaled at
                        that. Smoothies are relatively high on price, and so for our current pruposes, we can presume the use of
                        Soy, and our own drinking milk. 1 per week will do
                        <br>&emsp;Next is dried fruit, which, for our purposes, amounts to less-sugar cranberries. We use these
                        in
                        our trailmix and during the day. "Similar to protein, when we seek energy, but are prior to smoothies;
                        or
                        dinner." These cost 3$ normally, but can be gotten in extreme bulk for 2.50. The bags are not large, and
                        accounting for our trailmix is not unimportant. But, considering that you have a handfull or two a day,
                        and
                        a bag offers many of such, so is two per week a good estimate. At worst, this is 24$ a month, or 20 if
                        you
                        get on sale. Given the likely less than more amounts used, we can estaime on the lower end. "As you may
                        only
                        have 3 after two weeks, lowering the mean."
                        <br>&emsp;Third is protein. Tihs is a tricky one, as our exericse brings us to certain need. But,
                        generally,
                        the kinds of protein are limited, or at least few in kind, and so the choice is not so varied by
                        circusmtance. Simply, you have soy, which is bought in frozen bags; 3$ on sale, or around 2 at certain
                        stores. Tofu is a fair choice, 700g for 3$, or 450 for 2. Tuna is 1.25$ per can, meaning about 75 cents
                        per
                        serving. Sardines are equal, though better kinds are closer to 2$. These are quite delicious, though
                        they
                        only count as 1 serving. Tuna is about 120g while Sardines are a third less, all for about 50 more in
                        price. "Tis a privalged delight." Tuna is quite harsh though and not easy to enjoy. The use of oil, salt
                        and pepper makes this habitable; the use of margarine, or more precise blends of said spices may make it
                        more pleasing.
                        At any rate, protein has its place in the afternoon, following worn days or past workouts. Likewise,
                        following workouts,
                        you may find points following your smoothie/fruit where you want some extra protein, 'added to your
                        grain perhaps'. I
                        must admitt that although sardines are rather oily and fine, Tuna is rather rough and not all to
                        'refreshing'. The
                        acidity, or at least bend of the protein from these is greater than that of Soy; and despite any
                        misgivings or concern,
                        the consquences are not so entirely noticble. I tend to notice that my need for protein, if it be beyond
                        mere interest,
                        that such moments warrant the more acidic protein; in fact I seek that. The lack of ill that comes, and
                        the kind of want
                        which points me towards it, eases me in both percieved effects and principle.

                        though, or those you start late, you may add another period, making 7.5, plus the given half.
                        <br>&emsp;For 6am shifts, considering your up at 530, you more or less need to turn things off at 11.
                        This
                        is fine, but you could add another chunk but turning things off at 10. This is actually fine, and not
                        much
                        of a worry. "Delay your eating and gaming though." For a 5 and 4 shift, being up at 430 and 330
                        respectively, you need to turn off at 10 and 9 respectively. This latter is rather tough, but you can
                        give
                        yourself a little less room. Though, if all else is well, it is no hard to ask to have dinner between 6
                        and
                        8, then turn things off at 9, and go for a walk. 930-330 is doable.
                        <br>&emsp;Now, on off days, we give ourselves a proper 8 hour block, for a 7.5 hour shift. I am not
                        against
                        giving more periods, but you ought not stay up as late. Generally, if your down for 8, it seems so
                        fairly
                        ideal that you'd turn off around 11 --as you would on a 6:00 shift. This makes for consistency. The idea
                        that 6 hours is fine on a worknight makes these shifts very unimposing, as 11 is no harsh time to turn
                        in.
                        And honestly, it is not much an issue for off nights also. Truly, you may have more leninance with
                        gaming
                        and food, as you can 'color outwside the lines'. But having some sort of threshold for off nights makes
                        all
                        things better. For, given the extra sleep, your still up at 7, which makes going to bed at 9 even no
                        hassle.
                        At any rate, you could a) have a normal 6 hour at 11, or stay up longer, which is not ideal.

                        So we've spent all this time, as it were, being reasonable. To which end? Well I can detail the most
                        lovely
                        of times, in both flavor and constance. Yet I always find myself, like a gardner, merely rewarded with
                        the
                        chance to plant again; never really finding my place. At least, beyond my means to plant.
                        <br>&emsp;My time has never been so devoted, in the dedicative sense. But our amends to reason, or
                        living
                        deliberately, has no determined end. The point may be of our state of being, in quality that is. And as
                        regards money and sources of pleasure, so is this mere preference; as some may prefer higher highs and
                        thereby lower lows; while some prefer a more even yet steady pace.
                        <br>&emsp;In some sense, this direction is not so obviously false; or at least poignant as the clear,
                        and
                        perhaps only purpose in mind. There is a but however, and I have in all my years not been able to
                        satisfy.
                        <br>&emsp;My theory is that in our self regard, we tend to see things accordingly. "From steady grounds
                        that
                        is." And like one who sees this and is impressed to some end, 'be it attraction or repulsion', so do we
                        see
                        things from our own steadyness. And one of the objects in sight is that of the world, the rungs of
                        history,
                        the spits and spats of culture; exotic ends even or luxurious garments, 'tickling our indulgent like'.
                        As
                        such, my thought has always been that our idea of the future, 'or purpose rather', is one that is always
                        being acted on; as, unevenly or not, and far ahead or nearby, we are acting somehow or other. In the
                        basic
                        sense even, we have personal amends that wilter through the day, or seasonal things, as may remark a
                        developing friction in our family. And the point, is that be it near or far, personal or of all
                        humanity,
                        that we are drawn, directed and with action. What I mean by reason, or living as such, is that we give
                        some
                        sort of structure to this 'impressionability', or at least fashioning to our array of intakes and
                        judgement.
                        "For we may be wrong, or holding past judgements that are not either true or rightly applied in a given
                        case. And instead of questioning the world every time we take a step, we'd rather spend time thinking
                        about
                        in more appropriate times, whereupon the need of it, we have a formed anwser."
                        <br>&emsp;This is indeed our progressive model. For we have no real end in sight, merely what were
                        attending
                        to now. The sentiment which we are likely referring to, 'in our doubtlfull quibling', is in the extent
                        to
                        which we attend certain things. "As some focus on how they'll act during the current harvest, while some
                        plan for longer winters ahead." And in that sense, I have no shortcomings of strucutre, which is to say
                        reason, regarding the world as it pertains to objective farther than the present. For I don't strongly
                        believe there is a willfull, or at least benevalent govenor, or one who acts but with indifference. I
                        don't
                        find much motive nor cause for salvation; nor, in remarking upon a mere requisite, am I against, or even
                        without comfort, in an otherwise elected alternative. I don't feel the timely press of goverence, in
                        autocracy even. Nor do I feel that our everyday labor and bits are naturally poor, nor so outstanding
                        when
                        we consider our abilities, and rational need. "Where a little for me and all is enough."
                        <br>&emsp;When I think then of why we live from reason, it is those garnished robes and desire born from
                        its
                        conquest; the marvel and granduer which it ingratiates me with; the sweet and savory freshness which it
                        gives to the world and such around. Nor, in our fairest admittence, that of the just, or at least
                        antrhopilical meaningfull duty nature's placed upon us, do I see, or observe even in others, much
                        begrudgnig
                        ardor or plight. "And indeed, happiness being the cease of rot and worry, so in life and all her
                        demands,
                        our unburdened afair with such makes for an accordingly sizeable ease: for not nature's tighest hand
                        squeezes me."
                        <br>&emsp;This is the difference perhaps, of our remarks regarding life being but a mere allotment of
                        prefence. "And wisdom being but a tempering of those inexhasutible delights." I think things other. For,
                        when we are sitting here, considering things as such, 'of such allotment', we are acting as though there
                        is
                        no task upon us, nothing which we are bound to feel pain from. Wisdom indeed tempers us, but also
                        reminds us
                        of the common efforts required. These things being true make it so our care in life is not merely to
                        balance
                        out our pleasurable account, but more neccesarily rest and see from our unburneded grounds. That is, in
                        dealing with our deeds happily, so are we settled and inured, 'rather than openly free, and merely
                        plotting
                        an unmitigated cruise'. This is liberty. Her good is found in the calm currents of her otherwise rapids,
                        and
                        the tender warmth of her settled gaze and craft. Truly, she produces action which is not but rest amidst
                        demand. It is simply so, that of her broader paces, that they are set and made by that settlement.
                        "Where
                        the treats came from the scent and flavor which our liberated being ordained; or at least fashioned us
                        to be
                        drawn to in the sprouts of our liberty."
                        <br>&emsp;---Liberty sprouts from the soil of harmony. As life bears us down, naturally rooting us into
                        the
                        ground. While liberty is a result, of our actions being commiserate with such dynamics, as to overcome
                        the
                        pull, and without mere remedy or removal, but opposing force. Nature has given us plenty, and I am
                        gratefull
                        for the strenght she's given us. In fact, of good and evil, all and gained, I am truly at peace with the
                        one
                        who's fashioned the world: for whatever pull she's put upon us, so she gave us the lever to lift. "It's
                        as
                        if she knew that for us to be, life would have to be accordingly; but only fairly, were we given the
                        means
                        to be."

                        Our aim in life is wellness, well-being and well-living. The source for this, or, more or less, means,
                        is of
                        pleasure, be it of the happy or sensual kind.
                        <br>&emsp;Because many things can produce such, along with other effects, we say that something is good,
                        in
                        tha the pleasure it creates brings wellness. The end of being well-off or gluttonous, tends to have
                        goods,
                        or at least means, that are not so akin to the goods of well-being, and may in fact run contrary.
                        <br>&emsp;We don't say that things which don't bring out well-being are bad, in that they are not fully,
                        or
                        at least as good as those which do. But we do make note of our ends, and how whatever is bringing out
                        something besides wellness and well-being, is not effecting us in the best way. This is why being
                        well-off
                        is looked at as something beyond us, and not so rich and dear. Its aim is one of novelty and expensive
                        delight; but nothing which is lasting or meaningfull.
                        <br>&emsp;Of means then, you have those which provide a variety of pleasures. But we distinguish these
                        into
                        those of sense, be it of flavor and sight, or of happiness, in the sense of grace and security. Health
                        for
                        instance, is something we may experience during play; but it is generally something were aware of via
                        understanding; and similar to all sorts of security, we may simple be pleased that we are so well, 'as
                        the
                        future feels bright'. But, despite enjoying the taste of certain things, you may not be happy and
                        thereby
                        pleased with them, due to the contradicting effect upon your health, and otherwise stable pleasure. "The
                        moment of good feels outweighed by its susbquent erosion."
                        <br>&emsp;When I acquire granite countertops, we tend to like the look of them. But, it seems the
                        pleasure
                        comes from the excitment of having them, 'as if some ecstatic delight in it's prescence': in other
                        words, a
                        concentrated dose of happiness, 'for how great do I feel with this being hear'. Yet, this feeling tends
                        to
                        whither away, and over a relatively short period of time, the care you have for their prescence is
                        absent.
                        No longer does it make you that happy, nor was it ever that tasty of a sight. Indeed, such a thing was a
                        novelty, and is now a floating accessory. Yet, our effort for such thing was much more than this end
                        would
                        suggest, in worth. As such, if it brought us pleasure consisently, of sight and or ease, then we'd say
                        that
                        it was producing an adornment to our living. But since its pleasure more or less ceases, and soon
                        --considering the mountainous effort-- then so are we fair to say, that as a good, granite is not so for
                        well-being.
                        <br>&emsp;The notion of being well-off may then be but a remnant of confusion; as being somewhat murky
                        on
                        the truth of our aims, so did we hold a spot for alternatives. Yet it seems unneccasary. There is simply
                        that which creates good living, in that, as a good, its effects bear qualities to our life which we
                        truly
                        deem swell. "Any notion of bad seems more of a confusion of what is good; for things are merely so or
                        not,
                        but not something if the latter is so."
                        <br>&emsp;Ultimately, what we care for are effects with certain qualities. In the case of granite, it
                        produced a short experience of real good, but then died off. In the case of Kingship, it does hold
                        riches;
                        but you must move mountains, 'and perhaps overt your humanity' to acquire; and we thus say it is not
                        that
                        accessible or near. The matter of flavor is perhaps the trickiest to explain, but, we can rest on the
                        fact
                        that moments of pleasure, however sweet and fine, are not so encompassing to your day. Indeed, past
                        pleasure
                        brings with it a sort of ease, but along the lines of comfort. While appreciation is more of a drifting
                        pleasure as it feels supported and or warmed by things around. This takes a natrually calm yet active
                        notice. "I delight in the prescence of the moon, as it makes even my darkest moments find. But I must
                        see
                        it."
                        <br>&emsp;Our inquiry though, into the tastes of our pleasure, needs some sort of binding. As it is in
                        fact
                        hard to say why chocolate and wine is not as good as veggies and water. Indeed, the balance of satiating
                        pleasures with those of the happy sort, makes this easier. But so do we end up in a sort of concession,
                        'as
                        if we must merely be wise in avoiding that which, if constantly and without contrariety, wuold be the
                        best'.
                        In part this is true, for fried chicken does bring with it a sort of delight that carrots never will.
                        But
                        again, consider our aim in living well. This accounts for all of our life, its demands, our finer
                        interests
                        and all their lasting appeal. In a way, there are brambles and thicket around; and for the sake of
                        argument,
                        fairly. And so, as one born of the water, it pays much peace and comfort knowing their able, 'and
                        actaully
                        being so during the time of need'. But so, and perhaps this is the fruit of this portion, that of the
                        warmer
                        goods we seek, 'beyond the abasement of duty and effort, but joy and comfort', that so do these have a
                        mould, a figure if you will, and as such, we can judge the quality of this statues on how well they
                        stand
                        together, the quality in each, 'as a dense muffine, albeit sugary and sweet, may not hold as much favor
                        as a
                        mountain of fruit'; too, we may consider whether the required materials take away from our sheares and
                        pesticide, or, upon consumption, make is insolent and unable to such deeds. "Remarking upon the other
                        statues, so can we consider them equally, in that building and (more or less) consuming one statue,
                        drains
                        and or mitigates the prodcution and or use of another." For the good of work, or money rather, so doth
                        the
                        contrariety of a hangover lay --as it quells our capacity.

                        When I had my thing for Simron, I recall making a deliberate choice to not pursue, but let things carry
                        out.
                        This was so that things did not blow up in my face and become awkward; and, in tandum with that, I felt
                        that
                        the thing which we were otherwise acting on, was not so solid or true. There was merely a tenure of
                        care;
                        and be it from her I do not know. But, in being human, she could more or less become as inclined towards
                        me.
                        But my resolve was to the fact that this took time. And our trust was in the fact that if she went
                        somewhere
                        else, or us, that we'd be fine. "It was better to do right and fail, then more than likely attempt
                        something
                        and not succeed." We could more or less accomplish something; but our reservation came from the fact
                        that
                        besides any potential enamure between us, so didn't we care.
                        <br>&emsp;I feel the same way about Amon, and now Mikala. There is this human desire, this longing for
                        the
                        heart. And I saw hers and now another. What I'd say, is that considering we still let things be, 'and
                        live
                        happily commonly, and otherwise deeply on some far end', that we proceed in ways that allow any natural
                        repor to establish something at a greater pace. If were together, quibling, but with that sense of
                        enamure,
                        bring more to the conversation; so it is a less passing fancy and delight, but one that is deeper and
                        more
                        connected. The passive part is about the day, one's shift, whether their tired or not. But to bring
                        more, it
                        comes down to where one is from and what they like to do. Their home, family, school, interests,
                        hobbies,
                        delight. This is the esscence of a date; but you can simply be communal when the time is fair.
                        <br>&emsp;I must note this senitment, whereby in listening to music, we feel detached from those we care
                        for. The thing is, that in those moments, where song brings our stride right, we are not, more or less,
                        able
                        to dance with another, and otherwise care and or like them as much as our heart sings. We only wish for
                        them
                        to like us more, so that our candor is well-recieved.
                        <br>&emsp;What I notice though, is that much of our interest comes down to sex. Or at least, that
                        fashioning
                        of our heart, and the extension of that into our loins. This is the sort of relational warmth and treat,
                        which all other things of duty and interest are but adjoining. The truth of the matter, is that as we
                        age,
                        and those real matters hold precadence, that the mere interest of our heart becomes less so; and those
                        other
                        things must also be present. There is room to associate on more emotional levels, but the workplace is
                        not
                        so. And again, to bring more connection and feeling, we ought be able to associate on more substantial
                        things. This is what weaves us together in the world, rather than our floating yearning.
                        <br>&emsp;I mentioned statues, or figures rather, as remarkd the form of a joy and or delight. And when
                        I
                        listen to music, read Plutarch, or avoid even dramas and twitter, I feel ingratiated into life and the
                        world
                        in a certain way, 'as if my move and groove is to an according beat'. I only see though, how others are
                        with
                        other motions; which draws me to fret over not being near them, as to bear their attention towards me.
                        "As
                        there is less natural fitting for us to intertwine." And thus, I overly hope that they see me, being
                        special
                        in some sense, 'so that they forget their material interest, and become drawn to us in a merely
                        heartfull
                        manner'. The irony being, that I dont lack my interest; and so much as they live by theres, then there
                        is no
                        real comparability between us. And thus I merely hope that I can continue being me, while being
                        emotional
                        with them. "Yet this will never happen; becaue they are more than heart."

                        So, we direct ourselves on the basis of work; and to some extent chores. But, of what I really need to
                        set
                        aside as something which is moulded around another, is gaming. For we need to eat, stretch, walk, more
                        or
                        less prepare. And games and what not ought surround this; not the other way around.
                        <br>&emsp;I see some value in corn and tomatoe sauce, along with lighter beans. This can add protein and
                        eatability. The beans may be too rought; but with the sauce and corn, we can make our grain more tasty
                        and
                        thus worth an extra bowl. In fact, the biggest thing is in extending our time for grain, or eating more
                        during the day. I've landed on the morning veg then fruit, afternoon dried fruit, nuts, milk and
                        protein. In
                        a moment like this, where were off from work, have to work in the monring, and thus turn things off at
                        10,
                        and like finish eatin closer to 9, so am I looking for a good amount of a food, a MereFlow sesh, maybe a
                        game or two of breakthrough, a little time on video making; Im gonna walk now, around dinner, and maybe
                        a
                        stroll around 8. Indeed, between 8 and 9 is a great food period. We've made the deliberate call that
                        gaming
                        before bed is poor. At least the cost of it ought not be underestimated. Our time for sleep is clear,
                        but,
                        gaming is similar to heavy food, in that it ought finish prior to that, leaving our last moments for
                        roughage and tv.
                        <br>&emsp;The insight I have regarding food is similar to exercise, that, although the kind of thing is
                        important, it is more about the general practice of exercise and eating; and thus, doing these often,
                        through this or that manner, is whats important. We should be eating food through the day, from kale and
                        tomatoes, to an orange, milk and cranberries, to smoothies, peanuts and cucumber, to bowls of grain,
                        bread
                        and potato. Popcorn, crackers and spingrolls may come; but better for days like this coming Friday,
                        where
                        we've had our day off, and have two to come. Perfect. Exercise is equal, as is yoga, in that whats
                        nearly
                        required, if not best, is to do things through the day, and small as is fitting for such. We ought do
                        standing rise, strolls, breif aerobics and or running, with pushups and juggling to boot; leg stretch,
                        brief
                        lifts, seated stretches for neck and legs, on your back, rinsing of feet and hands.

                        Theres nothing like friendship, as you get one another. Love on the other hand, seems to come, perhaps
                        by
                        mere difference in sex, but, as such, by the motive of a comparable beat in one's heart; the remedy of
                        which
                        amounts to romance, relations, such love.
                        <br>&emsp;This is indeed one of the dearest feelings. Of all things in the world, the tributes, or at
                        least
                        figures reminiscent of Aphrodite, are many's favorite.
                        <br>&emsp;They are one though, at least of the bunch. And as such, our whole life is not so keen to be
                        entirely focused for the sake of that. Fair belief suggests that all may find love for eachother, and
                        that
                        it is more about facilitating such means. Culture has come about this way as to make things more
                        accessible.
                        While in modern times, there is not real custom; that is, the only rule is how others communicate, and
                        what
                        they want is all that matters. Such communication though is a blessed curse. For those who do not know
                        themselves, and are not otherwise unquestioning of who they are, then so is this open time but reminder
                        of
                        such: that of what we could want, we don't actually know.

                        There are these fallacies, akin to heuristics, whereby you compare your life to anothers, and attribute
                        something novel or different (from yours) as some mighty esteem, of which all are aware of and flaunting
                        over; while you sit, alone, unseen, pathetic. This is never true; and in fact, only comes by your
                        insolidity
                        of your own goods ands wears.
                        <br>&emsp;Of that, it seems that Mikaela, or Simron, even Bella, are an abscence to my heart, something
                        which would seem so nice. I have felt this for some time, that these feelings would suffice, if all else
                        was
                        well, and we were pleased with only this. This sentiment of flourishing and joy, reason, grace and
                        delight,
                        so would something other be fine. "Akin to one esteemed by tavel, and with a friend at that"
                        <br>&emsp;It is important though not to let your life get brought away, where you gaze at things, with
                        desire and or envy, of all but what you have. The good is here, often I feel it. But there is actually
                        alot
                        which, in a finer mind, you'd see. Our boss is quite nice, as are most our collegue rather fair. I get
                        along
                        with Joey, Andy, Tristan, Shanoa, Alex, Kim, Tera, Teresa, Brielle, Andre, Carli, Carry, Will, Mikala.
                        There
                        is so much. And I don't have a great deal of friends, nor any friendship or relation. But my life
                        doesn't
                        swelch for that. Were in fact fine, and making a grand ado with the circumstance. Normally, I'd feel
                        threathened or bethrothed to far off things, planning our commute. I recognize that what our life is
                        truly
                        outside those dreams and ventures is one thing. But indeed, I don't feel it is in much more than further
                        tasting what we have. This past evening, seeing Baker deep in the blue, what a sight. And this notion of
                        sights and security, what great sense and rigor this has instilled in me. And our remedy of rancour and
                        garulity, not even the news is a bother. And that Red Cross, how it brings me to a calm exclaim.
                        Perhaps, in
                        truth, I don't know much. And more that certaintly am I missing a friend. But the resolve might be best
                        in
                        doing what you know to be missed; yoga, online dating, 'as we for a moment experience', conversing with
                        people in more meaningfull ways.
                        <br>&emsp;I find, as all things old and honest, that this warm motions around me are suitable amidst our

                        fine in these regards. I just cant wait for Ark, playing Bf5 is so fine, even AOE4 is fun, along with
                        Derek.

                        I want an html website, scripts using jquerry.
                        <br>&emsp;Simply, I want to paste in a long piece of text which is segmented into pieces --ill wrap
                        these in
                        appropriate divs on notepad++. Then, in such divs, I want a small button that opens an overlay/modal,
                        which
                        several options. These will allow me to input a title, and categories. The categories are Philo, World,
                        Reflection, joy. In the top of the webpage, these categories shoudd be placed, and when I click them,
                        they
                        bring up the text associated with such categories. Also, at the top of each piece and its div, when I
                        input
                        a name via the modal, it should display that in small italic font (in said place at the top of the div).
                        Of
                        the categories and titles, these should be saved upon reload. I want the font of the main body of text
                        to be
                        centaur. Also, above the row of cateogires --near the top of the page-- there should be several square
                        buttons that change the background color --and keep it after reload. Also, I will be reading through
                        this
                        body of text, and so if i could return to the part I was at when I closed, or after reopening, that
                        would be
                        great

                        <br>&emsp;Enrrgy wise, theres cranberries, no sardines, a little bit of tofu, but some edamame.
                        <br>&emsp;Smoothie wise, theres full soy, blueberries, alot of frozen kale, flax, several bananas

                        <br>&emsp;Grain wise, theres a big bowl of barley, lentils and kidney beans. We need quinoa, lentils.
                        Theres
                        corn --which we might grab more of, since its on sale-- and we've got a few days worth of tomato sauce.
                        <br>&emsp;Starch wise, theres a moutain of springrolls, good amount of potatoes, popcorn, but no bread.

                        Sincerely, if some girl, of any sort, 'and perhaps one who I know', came to me, and with a gratuitious
                        or
                        sweet end in mind, spoke to me, 'and sought, or at least bode for actions as such', I'd amend in a
                        heartbead. I just wouldn't say know. And, surely, in my dreams, 'and otherwise, upon friction, doth lie
                        sparks of trouble', I see us asking for something similar, and recieving commisery.
                        <br>&emsp;But, I wonder if romance, or at least physical interaction, were not allowed, what would I
                        seek.
                        To talk and play? Well, what? What do you even know of such things, in which you'd relate. It seems you
                        be
                        bored.
                        <br>&emsp;Then, there is this notion of fantasy, or at least rot expectation; as perhaps sprung by your
                        own
                        youthfull whims and confidence, or confided and provoked by others around, who exlcaim to you, 'to just
                        hit
                        it, or, of all these things of the sort, its easy'; to which I then feel envy and or shame, 'as if I am
                        truly missing out'.
                        <br>&emsp;But I see clearly that we are dealing with people.
                        <br>&emsp;I look at Mikala, she smiles, asks me how I'm doing. This seems different than the average
                        person.
                        Normally, you get a hey, and not much else. But I am fooling myself, or letting my self be subject to
                        feelings quicker then they actually reflect, to think she says this, and in such manner, because she
                        likes
                        you, has feelings, thinks of you, 'has you in sight, and on her mind'. The truth of the matter is that I
                        want more, to not be alone, to see someone and be seen. But this does not make it so others speaking to
                        you,
                        as our general repor elicits, means that they are feeling something more. Were too keen to believe
                        otherwise, because we want it to be so. Perhaps it means so much for her to do as she does, that my
                        deeper
                        wants and 'dreams' are sprung, causing exageration. For we don't actually want her, relate to her, know
                        her
                        even. Its just like Holly, and Simron even, where we want her to be part of our life, but not the other
                        way
                        around. There is not truth that says she hasn't her own life and way. Don't despair as if vanity is her
                        aim,
                        or motivation; for which you will pathetic be devoid from. But, the ideal, or truth, is that were
                        brought
                        together as people: romance and love being a part of that. "There ought be substance beneath; otherwise
                        were
                        children at liberty to care only for such, and have not interests or needs beneath, 'for which our love
                        must
                        form around'."
