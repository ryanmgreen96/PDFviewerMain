                So a man is whoever exhibits the characteristics deemed worthy. And such worth, from the core of it, is
                born
                from our relations with nature; in that she pressures us, and thus asks us to be a certain way. “Surely
                the
                character which we remark as good, is one which yields success.”
                <br>&emsp;The question though, is in terms of the progress of virtue, and how the ‘pleas’ of nature
                become
                further known; or there are new ones. For it is easy to ascribe one’s property within a function as the
                mark
                of virtue; the classic example being the purpose of a saw, in its actions at least, and how being sharp
                was
                a measure of that. But in that case, what if we were cutting different material, and different qualities
                of
                the saw were sought —in durability for example. The framework of virtue stays, but the statement of
                fact, or
                inspiration for the measure —the draw for virtue- changes, and thus which virtues are in demand.
                <br>&emsp;I say this, because like all animals, Man’s earliest ventures were one of heat, water and
                food.
                Transitioning from there to the needs of governance is a tricky task, as the process of technology and
                the
                means of using it is not easy to say. For we need at this point some marker of discovery, or principle
                which
                explains man’s acquisition of further functions. Better yet, an understanding of the world in terms of
                her
                opportunities, along with pressures placed by her which we did not know. That a volcano was a threat is
                perhaps something for an animal who is cultured and prone to tales; while God and salvation is a mere
                extension of that.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed our own inquiry needs more exactness in order for its general use to be proper. But we
                might say, from this point, that man has a function via the request of nature; which we might say is
                motivated by man’s needs, of which nature advertises a remedy. “The very fact that water may be in an
                unknown area, portrays the difficulty nature imposes -in the sense of lands and distance. But so does
                someones ability to navigate, and in tangent with that acquire direction (via smell in this case),
                reflect
                an possession of virtue: literally, by virtue of their ability to succeed. “A challenge sets, and those
                with
                virtue are relevantly effective.”
                <br>&emsp;Perhaps we could give some duration to what’s being said, and consider the difference between
                animals and men, in that one has not quite ever succeeded, while the other reached some point of
                success:
                and from there, furthered.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed it is a matter of mechanics and definitions to properly state the developments of such
                success —as evident, via archeology for instance, and in principle, as in the general progress through
                various forms of tech and culture. Right now, our general principle is one of virtue and nature, and
                Man’s
                evident success as the one asked by the latter to exhibit the former —i.e, effective traits. But as
                mentioned, the actual steps this partake, needs more exact principles as to generally speak of man in
                more
                detail. Broadly speaking, he initially succeeded and went from there. But of what initially point and
                why,
                and through each subsequent point, doth the depth of inquiry lay.
                <br>&emsp;I will not speak of such things specifically. But I will orient this baser depiction. That is,
                considering man’s early successes, as homo even, the common property of such success is that it was
                pre-ancient. I admit this is a blank term; but I say it if only to preface what I will now explain.
                Pre-ancient means that advancements are not cultural, but techonocligal. This itself may not fully
                demonstrate what pre-society is, but so can we contrast the two with the assessment of our place amidst
                nature, and whether we are simply maintaining the necessities that we already have (in method and
                extraction), or if we are simply improving at getting by. For animals never succeed, as they at best
                survive
                in order to procreate, then die. Their always in struggle though. At least, they never have any means
                but to
                try, and hopefully succeed. And man may indeed have been like that. But so much as he was, was he an
                animal;
                while his developments which gave him more ‘concreteness’ amidst those troubles of nature, makes him
                less
                so.
                <br>&emsp;At this point however, comes the need to describe the transition between technology and
                culture.
                For one is made through excess, while the other is at best sufficient. If you imagine wild animals,
                their
                quest for food is always perpetual, in that they only have what they achieved that day, and have no
                definite
                means of succeeding again. Technology is man’s advent in order to revert that, whereby they acquire more
                than a mere instance of resources; or they have reliable means to get it again. By that, man became
                steady,
                or increasingly at least. And from that, inch by inch, society lay.
                <br>&emsp;The point I wish to make, is that as man acquired the first inkling of excess, so did the
                notion
                of ‘management’ come to be, as to better acquire such success (in quality of the means, and reliability
                of
                execution). But so did the question of ‘other’, be it near or far, come to be. If you could imagine,
                such
                excess, proprtioanlty, affords a slight amount of attention to be spent elsewhere. “Or not on the
                success at
                hand.” And in this state, lies kingship, belief and discovery.

                So nature is a certain way, as are we. We ought not define either of those yet, entirely at least. Let
                us
                start with our observations, and at that experience; for the pain and pleasure I feel right now is quite
                indicative of what I should attend; at least, if I am injured, then what sense do I even have to wonder
                if
                something else should hold my amends.
                <br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that we have basic needs, namely food, shelter and water. And nature,
                making
                such needs, has been kind to incorporate her own being within our design, in that she has given us the
                tools
                to situate ourselves amidst her promising ways. In that, the means to success lies in our dance with
                nature,
                the virtue of which lies in how we take such steps. Doing so well, will yield us what we seek.
                <br>&emsp;But as we become ingrained to such motions, so does the trouble of warmth and satiety pass.
                Our
                care for it lasts; but our struggle in achieving so wains. As this happens, we open ourselves to other
                troubles nature presents; or we apply ourselves to our current means, and make them more lucrative and
                accessible.
                <br>&emsp;If you could imagine though a group of stranded people who have barely enough to survive, that
                despite their current state, that no stability lay. In that, there are but moments of satiety, but no
                sense
                of future security. It is the transition from this state within early man to one where his concreteness
                in
                the world is established, and he is no longer fleeing from tigers, nor clambering for scraps of food. In
                that lies management, as the perpetuation of such success is in need of more than a useful tool, but one
                to
                wield it; both in skill and employment. Admittedly, this age is not fully known to me, and so the extent
                to
                which this ‘managerial’ process took place is not entirely clear. But there is a distinction between
                ‘cultural’ troubles later discovered and the management of that.
                <br>&emsp;In a way, people who gathered food were amongst those who could build shelter, find water,
                fight
                assailants and so forth. And as such, so long as kinship was present, so would the form of it surround
                such
                employments. As it were, as these were all duties and tasks, the matter of there being such things
                became an
                issue itself. For a group did not merely have to employ their members for the gain of resources, but had
                to
                orient themselves so that employment itself could be had. Because as further duties came to fruition, so
                did
                they get covered by the same organization of employment.
                <br>&emsp;In that way, pre-ancient marks a time where there was no excess to inspire or warrant
                management.
                “For a tiger is not employed to the hunt, but rather driven, day to day. While a fisherman has a
                routine,
                and a reliable one at that —at least he looks for such a spot.” Ancient times are those whereby we
                surpass
                the basic quest from nature, and organize ourself to achieve so concretely. That, and as that
                solidifies, so
                do we add more employments. And modernity is when we’ve situated ourselves within natures final task,
                and no
                longer exist in her response. For the first metallurgist was a result of the first farmer. And indeed,
                the
                cares of the farmer, or trouble which his employment solved, gave those to-be craftsmen the openness to
                discover and see such opportunity.
                <br>&emsp;What we’d better say is that man has come out of his animal ways, into a state of modernizing.
                Whereby he settled rudimentary layers, added broader ones, and let the latter settled into something
                solid,
                and further went by this routine.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, our state is best reflected in the custom of knowledge, and how what was once
                thought
                to be true relaxes, and accepts new truths. In whole, the tale of modernity, or that origin of kinship,
                is
                best summized by the earliest inquirers into indefinite things, and the abstract authority such things
                took,
                and the reign they held. I can’t say the source of the Greeks inquiry; though we can say that they
                acquired
                their ability to write from the Middle East. But uniquely, they were of a world which was, on the whole,
                well written. Their particular use of writing though, came from geography, in that their ‘managerial’
                form
                derived from the land gave novel means to differentiate and explore. By that, as the earliest inquirers
                saw
                only that which they could with their eyes, so did those in the classical age use the spoils and method
                of
                writing. Only, prior truths held much sway, and inquirer into such matters —entirely at least- were not
                fostered. As the farmer permits those in the excess of such advent (in terms of hands needed), so did
                the
                stable kinship of the Greek states give a freer edge to their inquiry. “Those in the world at that time
                had
                no lesser means, rather the liberty to use it. The Greeks were merely fortunate enough to have enough
                civil
                freedom to explore (as man had done before) in contemporary ways.”
                <br>&emsp;And indeed, the uniqueness of the Greeks is perhaps a mark of civil inquiry —using writing and
                past things written. While the roots of the world had been laid in the inquirers of old —the results of
                which only grew with time (as they could), and not with genuine reform- the conservative, if not
                convicted
                basis which such beliefs produced, gave no way for inquiries born of a newer age. Again, the Greek
                states
                gave enough freedom for such inquirers to be made. And while the rest of the world, initially inspired
                or
                not, kept down the traditional course, the pure inquiry of the Greeks still lay. And despite the more
                contemporary view of tradition (in the religions of high antiquity) so did the view born from modernity
                inspire those who later uncovered such riches.
                <br>&emsp;At first the Caliphate found the greek texts, spurring an arabic renaissance near the tip of
                the
                millennia. Then, via the charm of that, and the connection (via the crusades) of the east and west, so
                did
                those Greek inspired goods re-enter the meditteranean. I must admit some ignorance, but as we all known,
                the
                mid way of the millennia saw a dispersion of many folk away from tradition, and into different forms of
                theology. And my ignorance lies in the connection between the greek inspired scholatiscim (as conducted
                by
                those of tradition), and those who saw such work as a motive to something other than such tradition
                —however
                revitalized by the greek methods.

                Virtue is a mark made by demands, in that, of the function which is laid out, so lays virtue by ones
                able
                hand. But so do such workers likely have more than one need —as remarks the demands. “Where is thy food?
                Over there perhaps? It would seem so, but guarded by natural fortuity —in distance, skill, Required
                time,
                insight.” That wall to what we seek, as shown by the friction between whats sought and satiety, is the
                speaker of demands; who says, ‘all those who speak right and well, will pass.”
                <br>&emsp;But man is thus asked to say many things. He collaborates though with others of the species,
                as
                some may speak this language, that dialectic, those words. “By which the discourse between nature is had
                at
                multiple points.” For not even the smoothest of talkers could survive if their charm was only in the
                words
                of food. “For Posiedon must also be greeted, and the God of shelter at that — Hepheastus we’ll say.”
                <br>&emsp;I admit this is not sound entirely, but a fair principle could be, that man, in his sociality,
                is
                motivated and successful as so, by the collective virtue instated, and at that the plurality in points
                of
                success. “A true complexity of natural discourse.”
                <br>&emsp;That being said, the conduct of man has never been so successful on the basis that there were
                others around him who held virtues he did not. This in itself is true, but is not the point where one
                thrives. Rather, the virtues of such collective, and at that the propriety in such variable employment,
                marks the true point of success. For in that, all needs are in question; and thus, the collective virtue
                is
                deemed remarkably so, if it is effective in such unity. If one part fails, then the whole does not
                succeed.
                And by that, so do the members without such means, personally fail. That is the dynamic of virtue in a
                team.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed it is one thing to measure the accounts of such virtue; as one with a skill for
                navigation
                may simply be unhad. But it is another, that within the presence of a fully collective means, that so is
                the
                management of such collective a virtue in itself.
                <br>&emsp;For the process of community is not so easy to say. As we must look at the early remnants of
                man,
                and primates at that, to see why the ability for communion is possible. But in terms of our principle,
                we
                could say that as one man achieves success in navigation, and another in the foraging of food, that
                reciprocally they share: as the spoils of one meets the needs of the other: and together, each of their
                needs are filled —via sharing. But if we could imagine that such harmony is based on an understanding of
                the
                other, in that one sees their ability to do one thing, like the other; and by each particular success,
                the
                bounty is shared. But as this shared employment ensues, so is there a remark about the needs of the
                communion. For the individual functions are acted as extensions from a common point —to which the shares
                are
                returned to. “I’ll go west for wood, and you east for stone: meet back here and we’ll share the flame.”
                But
                upon that, as each is settled amidst the shared goods, the question of sustaining such employment is
                wondered. At least, an inquiry as to the merits of proper management of such collective comes up. As one
                would level out a path to a reliable means of resources, so would a community establish within
                themselves
                the grounds and character to improve such collective. For there may be problems we could afford to
                solve,
                via the efficiency. That, or we may improve the means to the ends we’ve already employed ourselves
                towards.
                Better yet —though this may simply be how it happens, as opposed to being supposed— that our attention
                may
                catch onto things we had no prior awareness of. For people tend to get sick; but our collective is aimed
                primarily at gathering shelter and fuel. But so does the solidity of that afford some attention to
                remedying
                our illnesses. “Even past that, lies one who, upon sitting up from some ail treatment (to catch their
                own
                breath), saw a star twinkling in the sky. And what may that be?”

                We can separate the insights of man by those which are basic, and those in excess. Man, or Homo, is an
                animal who beat his natural troubles, and became thus suitably fed, quenched and warm. As this occurred
                though, his attention was drawn to other things; be it elements somewhat local, or figures afar. For a
                deer
                runs from a volcano, as would early homo -like all monkeys do. But at some point, after running away, he
                did
                not just go upon his day, following the fear he faced, but questioned such danger. “As if he remembered
                that
                he was afraid, and by what.” The attribution of this to something other worldly is hard to say. But
                indeed
                this is the exchange between naturally compulsive responses, and those which man had to deliberately
                ascertain. “There was no longer a loud noise and a bang, but someone hiding with a gun behind the
                brush.”

                So I tend to make claims along the lines of virtue, rather than ideals. One sees the world
                theoretically,
                and orients it so that, if upon good action, preferred results would shine. While the other, simply
                adheres
                to the world as is. Moreso, the conditions which we adhere to are not altogether altered, in action or
                wish.
                <br>&emsp;At that, the difference comes down to who we are as people, in that, of the good, it is
                through us
                in and how we are. While the goods of ideals, seem altogether arbitrary, albeit with strong intent.
                <br>&emsp;It is hard to say though, for the goods of ideals are found in the realm of philosophy and
                civics.
                Meaning, that the ultimate notion of the soul is used as a principle, and ordained to us; with the
                gumption
                that we are set and known within such basis. “To which, our ideal good, is marked by our ideal portion
                of
                such basis.” But such an end is not about our heart and bones, rather the motions of our objective being
                upon the soul. “Which is to say, that transcendent or not, that our natural being is set (or sourced)
                upon
                something truer; of which theology and pure morality conjecture about.”
                <br>&emsp;That is one thing though, for the character of metaphysics and all its adjacent is not in any
                way
                simple to say. Virtue however, is much easier to expound.
                <br>&emsp;For starters, the idea of virtue is, in its form, applicable to the real and ideal world. A
                saw
                for instance, has an objective form by which it is virtuous, or sharp; but it also has an ideal form, by
                which its principle purpose is exhibited; and virtue may be of such. Or in other words, the proper trait
                it
                exhibits may be with respect to its real or ideal form.
                <br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean to speak of real virtue. Or the property which best responds to the
                conditions we’ve experienced. “The nature around us, and what she’s shown and asked us to adhere to;
                rather
                than what we think, if we adhered to, would produced something ideal.”
                <br>&emsp;For the problem lies in the ends, and the gaze beyond who one simply is. For in that, I notice
                that a lack of food breeds insatiety, as will a lack of water leave me parched; and too little warmth
                similarly, or an excess of wetness.
                <br>&emsp;I say all this, for I mean to see the world as something we respond to, rather than surpass,
                and
                then oblige some further plea. There may be perils waiting for us, ‘sent by one who cared little that we
                had
                otherwise reached success’; whereby our damnation was due to ignorance and content — as if in terms of
                the
                world, we’d won. Equally, this sensibility may afford promise, in that, if we went past such ignorance,
                then
                we may reach further and or greener pastures.
                <br>&emsp;This is the true line whereby the critiques of the past meddle with the current scope of
                philosophy, and the increasing satiety and content of modernity. For in that reign, crumbles the
                principles
                of such ‘foreign’ fears and promise. For they seem either uncredible -and at that contrary- or are not
                so
                abundantly decent in their reward; as man, in his nature, cares little more than for a fed stomach,
                quenched
                mouth, warmth of a home and that of a friend, and a marbling of security and creative access. “It is a
                fair
                critique of those who suggest otherwise, that their motives are born from a lack of the former
                mentioned.”
                For there is indeed, historically, a damning statement by those who profess some greener pasture. “As if
                the
                current grove was riddled with rubble and despair.” Indeed this is true, for man’s belly is not always
                full;
                nor does any meal promise the next. “But the promise of satiety is what he truly seeks; rather than the
                possibility of goods which come outside such condition.”
                <br>&emsp;A great deal of conflict has come by man starving himself down the path to the goods beyond:
                and
                those hungry later on, parlayed for the satiety of that. “At least, in fact, man has not beholdened
                himself
                entirely to the lands beyond the world, and at that his earthly need."
                <br>&emsp;But so lies the motive for humanity, that her brethren may be with fuel and stead. And as one
                alone does what they can with the tools they have, and a pair of others does so equally but for the gain
                of
                both, so is the collective of all people an extension of such efficacy, and the shared customs (as shown
                by
                the worth) for such community, so that it may be as ably run, holds but an association of personal
                agreements, ‘by the reciprocity that each member sees, in their offer and reward’. Virtue as I say, in
                this
                practice, is merely the demonstration of such intent by the people in such association.
                <br>&emsp;This may be itself full of principles and ideal, but the basis is one of man, and at that it's
                possible mean of responding to nature. Generally, the conduct of the community may itself be extold. But
                the
                reality is, that such a community is merely a group of individuals exhibiting collective virtue.
                <br>&emsp;At that, I mean only to start with words and custom as becomes me and my fellow man. This text
                is
                an illustration of that after all; and lives in the world of both my expression (e.g in letters or
                speech)
                and subjection (e.g gravity and need to breath).
                <br>&emsp;The past is not unimportant, but simply serves as a datum of experience. The vectors and
                eligibility of propositions are in full use here, whereby those who offered so a time ago, are measured
                by
                the methods used to determine today.
                <br>&emsp;Of an end though, which is seemingly forever conceded to, and at that in our efforts to
                define.
                <br>&emsp;In that, the core virtue is one of real knowledge, in that someone is aware of and ordained to
                the
                character needed for the truest end. It may be one beyond the bounds of earth, and at that, the extent
                may
                be one that offers additional promise, or threat. But so, whoever knows, will be in possession of a
                proper
                guide. For with such knowledge, they hold the ends to which they must calibrate themselves towards.
                “Whereby
                real virtue is bound.”

                People are trying to learn about the world. Doing so requires that they investigate. During so, they
                experience the world as they are able to, ‘in that one’s normal vision only sees a certain spectrum of
                light’. But as much as their faculties can compute, so will their impressions apply.
                <br>&emsp;In this though, lies the kinds of knowledge one receives, namely those which are natural or
                supernatural. Of the former, these remark the repeated, or at least seemingly sequential occurrences of
                the
                world, and the inscription (by the viewer) of such sequence. The statement of such ebbs and flows amount
                to
                laws, in that by whichever basis, so are such motions produced. “And laws describe such motions.”
                <br>&emsp;If the matter is not natural, but of a supernatural sort, all this means is that what one
                experiences is not an occurrence of nature’s sequence, but an instance instead. In that, lies the heart
                of
                miracles, visions and reactions from a supposed other world. An augur for instance, sees a birds flight
                and
                interprets that as meaning something for the natural world. “As if the tectonic plates below caused a
                motion
                of the bird, and gave the impression that other objects would be subject to a certain motion within
                their
                own relation to the plates.”
                <br>&emsp;Distinct from that is a messiah, which is not merely an instance or act which corresponds with
                the
                baser motions beneath, but is an exhibition of such basis in object form. The bird that an auger sees is
                not
                itself an insight, but rather what such motions suggest of the basis below. A messiah on the other hand
                is
                akin to such basis taking on the form of a bird, and flying in a elaborate way: by which something clear
                and
                deliberate is given in terms of insight, rather than a conjectural supposition of what the flight of an
                ordinary bird means.
                <br>&emsp;It is true though that such a prime being is not necessarily natured, for they may be a normal
                object (with communicative potential) which is intimately linked with the basis; or they be the basis
                itself, merely formed in a way that allows for communication.
                <br>&emsp;In either case, the conduct of such being is one of alteration and insight. For they may
                literally
                turn water into wine, or share what God has told them. And it is not unreasonable to suspect that
                someone
                listening to the words of the latter does so because they’ve seen (or heard of) acts of the former.
                <br>&emsp;In this though, lies the critical divide between science and divine based philosophy. For
                both,
                per the core of philosophy, seek a truth (and by that permit the presence) of something deeper than the
                surface level appearance of the world. “As if there were more than what we commonly saw.” But in terms
                of
                what they are trying to explain, or find the basis for rather (of such appearance), so does such subject
                come about through natural or supernatural means. For one who sees a miracle, or hears the words of a
                spirit, will seek the explanation of that. While someone who observes the moon’s motion’s, and ascribes
                such
                steps as reminiscent of dynamical laws, will seek the basis of that. As Newton said, ‘by whom and to
                whichever end I do not know, but of what is governed it is these motions; and such motions are
                understood by
                these descriptions.” Saying, in other words, that via such descriptions, we understand the objects which
                are
                under (or on) some basis. Philosophy is the admittance of such basis, and not then a denial of the real
                world, nor an acceptance of rhythmic laws. To be fair, the things which the laws express, or illustrate,
                has
                no definite limit in terms of what can be known; nor is it unfair to suspect that as our understanding
                (and
                descriptions) reach greater depths, that the basis for such things will become known. Or, better said,
                that
                what we mean when philosophizing, that beneath even the understood surface, lies a basis to that; but so
                may
                the basis of that be itself definite, rather than metaphysical.
                <br>&emsp;Metaphysics, or a transcendant basis, may be possible, or it may simply be real — or not meta,
                but
                definite, and not transcdenat, but entire within the reality which there’d be transcendence of.
                <br>&emsp;In that way perhaps, it might be better to ascribe the confidence in the latter as a faith in
                reason, in that if we are to be complete in that way, then we will have understood and explained all
                things
                within reality —with no transcendent need.
                <br>&emsp;Bringing this back, it is all too common for ‘supposed’ instances of things not seemingly
                real, to
                serve as either indicators or proof of something transcendent. Beyond the source of speech and thinking,
                the
                alteration of water into wine is not something which, in a pure reality, is consistent with the rest of
                things. Thermodynamics for one, does not permit it.

                I don’t care for the news, despite its good intent, for the criticisms and ideals which it presents seem
                too
                bare to match the enormity of the world. Locally, I see some merit; but it is not uncommon for ‘local’
                to
                equate to several million people, and at that many large towns. “Not even a neighbourhood is the metric
                for
                constituent pieces, but towns themselves -but are they so small?”
                <br>&emsp;And the question then comes to virtue, in that we, as people within a community, have some
                sort of
                obligation to each other. That, and as the scale of such community broadens, so do our duties extend.
                For if
                we are truly people of the world, and at that one with all on earth, then so do we have virtues of the
                sort.
                <br>&emsp;The problem though is one of excess. For the purpose of society, whole and small, is to
                produce
                what each individual can offer at an excessive degree. “We all put something in, and more than what we
                could
                do alone come’s out.” And indeed this is how society has functioned for a millennia. That, and the
                notion of
                collective virtue has been around almost as long: for the virtues which co-operation supports, need
                virtues
                which organize such support. Both in terms of ample and opportune employment (of each member), and the
                distribution of each members contribution. Moreover, the act of determination and execution of such
                organization becomes a role in itself; which has virtues of its own.
                <br>&emsp;It is worth noting too, that the virtues of each member is in part within their unified nature
                within a collective; so that those who are hunters would hunt with the collective in mind, while those
                who
                governed would do so with their purpose (as governors) in mind.
                <br>&emsp;In that, we say that collective virtue is defined within the general realm of communal
                structure,
                and each members subjection to it. “So that they may not fret about the excess which they’d otherwise
                have,
                being sent evenly to others around. Each member ought have eachother in mind.”

                What we are going to assume, is that man is an animal, and at that something with needs; which is to say
                a
                relation with nature, who both supplies and demands (in efficacy); moreso, has she gracefully made us
                with
                those tasks in mind, and at that formed us to be in need of the results of such task. This is what we
                are.
                <br>&emsp;We also must assume that we are social animals, in that of such tasks, we both recognize the
                worth
                in cooperation and have the means to do so. In this lies a property of virtue, namely the resourceful
                aspect
                of it, in that if one is in need of food, then the virtue required is not only in character but
                ingenuity,
                in that the route to such ends can be seen, but executed on to. For example, if one’s ingenuity can see
                that
                a shell is liable to be smashed (and offer the food inside), then the trait which provides such
                recognition
                is in need of a paired trait of dextrousness, and at that craftiness, in order to conjure and harness
                the
                thing which smashes. All in all, our recognition of cooperation is one which requires the ability to see
                others as viable benefit, and then act in ways that facilitate such unity. “Mans basic social virtue is
                in
                seeing others as allies, and treating them with as is appropriate for reciprocity.” And beyond the
                smaller
                locale, a broadening of such union may neccessitate collective virtues, as to permit organization of the
                many, and at that the concession of each to the whole. “This extent of man’s basic social virtue is
                perhaps
                one of reproach and sense, in that two hands being better than one may be so in the furthest sense, but
                thus
                require the facilitation of such community. To which man’s baser virtue is paired with a sense of
                reason, as
                to consent to the will of such virtue.”
                <br>&emsp;At that, it is fair to say that man must be reasonable so much as he is virtuous, for what the
                latter suggests (in proportion to its scope) bears weight upon the formers presence, as to guide what
                may
                otherwise be contrary to the promise of such virtue. “Wait my friend and see, and your conceit to such
                community will bear fruits greater than your own impulses and effort.”

                As it were, this sense of collective virtue is not itself a marker for an age. Man may be social and
                collective, but in a merely minor, if not local degree.
                <br>&emsp;What separates primitive man from those ancient is in the unity of such locales; so that a
                tribe
                has to deal with other tribes, and at that convene. Surely the transition from primitive to ancient ways
                saw
                times where such ‘convening’ was unfruitful. But eventually communities bigger than tribes ensued,
                becoming
                states, and empires of those.
                <br>&emsp;It might be fair to think in terms of civility, and by that recognize villages as the earliest
                civil communes. Their comparison to a tribe is not clear, but the presence of infastrastucre is surely a
                dsitnguihshing factor.
                <br>&emsp;What we mean then, is that villages, or civil communes, interact with those of the same sort,
                and
                at that, broaden the collective into something akin to a state, or kingdom. These, to be clear, are what
                empires are composed of, in that the realms of Africa, Spain, Italy, France and Central Europe
                constituted
                the empire of Rome. While each province was a mesh of smaller (village like) constituents.
                <br>&emsp;At this point, I am not clear on the ideals of a collective beyond that of a village. And
                historically, it seems that such attempts were more on the selfish end. And I must admit that the
                peculiar
                facts of that are not known to me. “Perhaps I wish not to grieve over such ‘conquests’, and at that
                graze
                over this state of empires and states.”
                <br>&emsp;Beyond the impetus, it is somewhat fair to presume that such union of smaller collectives was
                done
                through conflict. Indeed, I can see the value in the world as it is; at least it seems unlikely that a
                plethora of villages would each build their own factories and transmit systems. Thus there seems merit
                in
                higher collectives by virtue of the greater amount of resources that the administrators can expel. I
                also
                think that the impetus for ancient collectives was mystical, in that those of higher rank in the smaller
                communes were seen as exhibitors (and at that earthen judges) of the Gods; and that by the convicted
                quest
                to have all foreigners (alike the natives) submit to such King, so the impetus lay.

                As it were, lands that united themselves into kingdoms and empires, grew more reach then those which
                remained ‘pastural and village like’. This can explain the ability for Europe to colonize the Americas,
                despite there being people present. If such folks had extended the scope of their community, then so
                their
                stamp be in place. But a countries power far supersedes those of individual clans.
                <br>&emsp;In an equal manner, the legacy of knowledge pours from those who acquired the most of it. And
                those who could, did so according to their means, in both skill and liberty. For the freest thinkers of
                primitive times had nothing but their wandering gaze —and broad definitions. While those with precise
                language and the method of writing could ask and ponder in more elaborate ways. “For more had already
                been
                via written hands.” But so do such means require the freedom to use them. And past the advent of culture
                -and its mystical side- so were blanked questions discouraged —fatally in some instances.
                <br>&emsp;Along these lines, the Greeks were part of a time which had come from the prior age of
                Mesopotamia
                -and her findings. From this, beyond any derived context, they strictly found the means for writing.
                Paired
                with that was the structure of their states, which were quite stable due to their limits via geography.
                From
                that, nestled a relatively high amount of freedom to pursue both inquiry and craft. Per the former, the
                Pre-Socratics, Sophists and Hellenes lay.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the lands around Greece progressed as all others had civilly, namely in the lining
                of
                states into empires. In the case of Greece, the Northern realm of Macedon incorporated those in the
                southern
                peninsula. And those by the Romans forthwith.
                <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to the civil state of the Arabs, but via the uncovered Greek texts they were
                inspired to in the ways they inquired, or that they should inquire at all. Regardless, a middle eastern
                age
                of inquiry ensued. And to those later associated with them did the spoils (of prior Greek thought)
                continue.
                <br>&emsp;The point, is that the world operates a certain way. And generally, most of it behaves in the
                same
                manner. Only, the reason for any present motive is likely born from some past initiative —i.e. the
                primitive
                notion of a leaders divine right, and at that endowment to all property and folk (be it foreign or
                native).
                But, the natural expression of people outside antiquate ways, makes for developments which stick around,
                ‘even when such folk are smothered by the surrounding states and their tradition’.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, this is the mark of the Greeks, in that they were simply those of higher ancients who
                purely thought.
                <br>&emsp;But the question is of our civility, and the manner in which it broadens, and for which ideal
                end.
                For I want to say that the current state of the world is simply one born of all the pieces settling
                together, and at that by an age which was prompted up (initially) by such decree to expand, and at that
                vie
                for lands and right. “All those native, born and led by such decree, saw all things beyond them as
                property
                of theirs. At least to be.” Indeed, as remarked by those broadly conquesting, that those who lived in
                their
                sought for lands were but barbarians, and sometimes savages. For the latter marks a sort of perceived
                conduct of a people; while the former term is but a disintciton between those native and not. “They are
                barbaric who are not of us.” Which is indeed a relative term, and at that possible within any character
                —as
                all can see who they are, and who is not.

                The notion of locality, and at that nativity, within early tribes, is to me an anthropological mark of
                people. Just as we assume, or at least mention our ability to socialize, so ought we include the notion
                of
                fear, and of what. Whatever then spurs conflict is one thing, or for what ends rather, but that there
                were
                ‘others’ is not surupisring. “Collective virtue has never been a matter of people, but our own folk.”
                <br>&emsp;The reality though is that collectives are governed beyond their basic ends. And by that it is
                important to note how certain issues become addressed through the collective. In that lies the mystical
                findings of man, and the incorporation of such truths into the functions which the tribe provides.
                <br>&emsp;For it has been said that community allows for efficiency, and at that spexiliaztion; either
                in
                the ways that current things or done, or for new things which get noticed in this state of excess. By my
                accounts this is where spirits and folklore were born. The details regarding it, as in the case of the
                motive and effects of food and conquest, are not known. But it seems fair (as in those others) to fit in
                generally.
                <br>&emsp;If I knew more, I might be able to mingle conquest and piety together. It seems that the heart
                of
                the latter came about prior to any extensive acts of the former. I cannot say entirely though that said
                latter caused such former acts. Those seem to be based on a discrimination of whats native and foreign.
                The
                motivation could be to destroy such things beyond the locale, or to assimilate them. At least their
                views
                may be self involved, in that they thought they had rights to all —partocualry of those in leadership
                roles.
                Divinity surely had an influence then.
                <br>&emsp;Overall, it is not hard to see that as the bounds of earth were settled, and for whichever
                reason
                conflated —first into villages, then kingdoms, empires. And such states brought with them that tradition
                of
                piety. Which by my accounts is the source of all things bigotry. For it is one thing for ‘all things
                foreign, or not native’, to be deemed a threat; as not even deer are accepting of much more than their
                local
                herd. It is another though, for the motions of such discrimination to have antagnositc motives curried
                by
                religion. Thats not to say there isn’t conflict born from natural ends. But of the direction born by
                religion, I’d say the source of elitism and genocide spring from there.
                <br>&emsp;Again, the discirmante conduct of man is more or less natural. Only, the twisting of such
                impressions can make the destructive interests moreso, or at least create a classist attitude regarding
                those assimilated.
                <br>&emsp;Better said, the separation between folk is one thing; but religion, and or piety born of a
                certain locale, only makes those within that locale more unique, and at that inherently different than
                those
                around. And whether such difference spurs elitism or genocide, so is the native sense one of further
                distinction (regarding all thats foreign).

                As it were, the advent of man modernizing begins 3.3 mya with the fist discovery of lithic technology.
                <br>&emsp;As it is known, the neolithic is the point of the Stone Age where agriculture emerged. But
                besides
                that, the resounding feature of each period of the Stone Age is of the lithic techniques used for
                toolmaking.
                <br>&emsp;Within the lower paleolithic, the initial lithic mode was lukemian, while the predominant form
                was
                Odean. At 1.7Mya this transitions to Achean.
                <br>&emsp;The mid paleolithic marks the beginning of art, social structures, burials and things alike.
                Theres also a mention of trade. Within this period Homo Sapien spread out from Africa.
                <br>&emsp;The Upper paleolithic begins 50Tya, and begins broader social activities and art —petroglyphs
                (carvings).
                <br>&emsp;Mesolithic — 20tya to 7tya
                <br>&emsp;Neoolithic marks agriculture and advance tools for harvesting plants. Large scale structures.
                Began, notably at least, in the Fertile Crescent — Euphrates and Tigris river.

                Ideally, we’d know how things come together, and thus have some guide for the time ahead the present.
                <br>&emsp;But this seems unnecessary, and at that not to be so. For we have said, generally, that
                considering our need to breath, eat and sleep, that so hath nature given us the means to such ends; but
                in
                that, required of us to be a certain way, principally (as in disciplined) and with skill.
                <br>&emsp;The question, is if a group of individuals exhibits collective virtue, what does that mean for
                the
                individual themselves? Perhaps the modern source of this conundrum, whereby the form of such collective
                is
                off, brings up questions of bravery and protest.
                <br>&emsp;But in that, I see but a moment ahead, and at that one’s vitriol in the imbalance of that
                moment
                to be. In terms of the future, so does momentum and trajectory lay. And by that, the vitriol of the
                moment
                is exchange for calmer virtues; one’s which exhibit themselves with respect to the whole of our days,
                rather
                than the evident moment.
                <br>&emsp;Its important to note, that by the annals of consistency of anisotropy, that the form of
                things at
                hand bears more assumptions than the natural need (and our according natural presence) to eat and sleep,
                but
                also sense, worry, fear, and by that see beyond what is definite and clear, in those things of an
                abstract
                or mysterious sort. As man’s expression had the time and developed means to paint bulls on the wall, so
                was
                he able to express his notice of the sky, the moon, devastation, and common disturbances such as illness
                or
                death.
                <br>&emsp;It is important, and at that interesting, to explore the basis of these assumptions —in our
                needs
                and impressionability. But I’d say, for the moment, that we can merely express that collective virtue is
                one, that in all senses of frailty, ought one fix such, or address it at least.
                <br>&emsp;For one permits themselves being equitable within the collective, and by that, subject to the
                custom of such collective -be it in the vibes of each member, or those which are determined, and at that
                managed.
                <br>&emsp;Besides any recent examples, it is our point to note that one’s place in the collective is not
                entirely made by their reasonable exceptence of its ways, but in that a more civil reward from their
                participation; and at that, a liberty to do as they leisurely, craftily and or curiously please.
                Mistaken
                truths cause friction here; but our ideal remains.
                <br>&emsp;This is where I struggle. For the American dream is that each member has the rights and
                freedom to
                pursue what they please. And by that, each family which comes, be it with nothing or a historic all, can
                act
                liberally, and at that via their own interest. What is proper though, is that such interest be in line
                with
                the ways of the collective. Despite holding the right to suffrage and thought, so mustn’t they committ
                theft
                or assault, and at that coerce someone to doing something out of custom.
                <br>&emsp;My ignorance though prevents me from stating the ‘inhumane’ policies instigated or disgenuine
                activity. Are corporations a vice to the collective, and at that preachers and belligerents. Saying who
                these are, and in by which whole educate, is not easy to say. Though much public information is.
                Expressed
                around such disputants.
                <br>&emsp;I can only say, that if someone is wrong, or inappropriately behaved —for none, outside the
                military, have any permission to commit violent acts- that their place in being so within the complex of
                the
                industrial age is one that wholly derived from baser principles. And necessarily, the various parts of
                that
                complex ought be considered when we judge those involved in such level. For in the collective virtue,
                their
                may arrive the presence (and by that submission) to a charter, whereby certain rules and custom are
                agree’d
                upon for the functioning (and at that benefit) of the collective. In that though, there may be
                additional
                posts, such as the facilitators of such laws, and the judgement of those in contrast. Here lies the
                birth of
                courts, and at that administrators of the collective policy. By this decree, the need of which is born
                from
                the agree’d upon structure of the collective, so is the employment of such role in need of one’s
                compribale
                in such task. Thus came legislators, litigants and judges.
                <br>&emsp;My point, is that if we are to judge a litigant and the the quality of their litigating
                conduct,
                ought we know the form and virtue inbided which such person is evaluate against. “What is a good lawyer,
                and
                a proper one at that? And ought we have our own sense of why there is propiety at all, and at that
                contextual aims (for which virtues are valued traits).”
                <br>&emsp;At any rate, this is just a method of propiety, in that we hold our criticisms and contrition
                at
                bay, less we have a solid basis to judge on. What the real question is, or the main one, is the duty of
                those in the collective to partake in such roles of litigation or legislative creation —and so forth to
                military operations, civil engineering and so forth. For it is one thing to say that a litigant is bad;
                while it is another to say that, all things considered, that my place as a non litigant is not to do
                with
                the business of litigation. At that point, it is perhaps right that such realms of the collective ought
                have
                their own committees and checks, as to suitably manage such affairs. For my place as a shoemaker does
                not
                imbibe me with the proper sense of a litigants abilities or conduct. But this evaluation need not be
                self
                managed, or at least internally managed (by other litigants), but by a focused group of those educated
                in
                the proper ways of such litigants; and like a enforce and or official of the law, who holds reign over
                those
                breaking it, so do such monitoring committees serve as a suitable enforce over the field of litigants.

                My thoughts always come back to virtue, in that we are all subject to something, and at that, virtuous
                by
                our effective oblige. What this is in contrast to is hard to say; but perhaps a fair note is that the
                things
                were subject to, truly, are not able to be changed, merely responded to. The difference is seemingly one
                of
                history, and how people see the obligations placed upon us as done so though the wills of other people;
                and
                at that seem liable for change.
                <br>&emsp;This is not base enough, by my counts. For indeed, laws, states, economies and office have
                come
                about; and beyond their own arrangement, so has primitive thought influenced the succeeding generations
                involvements (in such arrangement). But the source of this all is upon those base necessities; which
                even
                upon the fairest of states, still rests upon the unyielding demands of nature, and at that our virtuous
                oblige.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, false pretence has born a lineage of native divinity, and at that a contrast was
                those
                of other nativities. This has been incorporated into the sense and structure of modern states; at least
                the
                former quality was part of the classical irons, while the latter was ingrained to those medieval. Even
                though industrial states have rid the premises of such tradition, so do the liberated folks have no
                lineage
                of their own. Despite the lands being at liberty for them, so are they incapable, by their previously
                held
                position. “Thus the critique’s of modernity lay; not in their motive and course, but the history of
                those
                partaking in the lanes: and some being steady footed compared to others.”
                <br>&emsp;This is an odd sentiment. For the specifics really don’t matter. Instead, the notion of virtue
                is
                binary in its address, in that we either head for the ideal, and let the validity of that even things
                out;
                or we locally, or via the moment address, and at that resolve ourselves to the status of the collective,
                rather than its end.
                <br>&emsp;For the inequality of folk is more or less born from classist mindsets. That, and the idea of
                locality, and the ceasing domain beyond such borders -by which those outside are not of right. Conquest
                arrives here, as does slavery.
                <br>&emsp;But let’s consider for a moment a native family, who is not subject (or has been) to retched
                inequities, but simply held lineage in the heart of a powerful land. If they are workers in an economy,
                then
                what ought they receive in terms of sympathy?
                <br>&emsp;Perhaps its better to remark the reasons which distributed custom and roles within the baser
                societies, and at that, made way for states which proliferated the inequity we see today.
                <br>&emsp;For my belief is that, beyond something true, that the inequity towards those of contrary
                sexes,
                orientations, faiths or ethnicity, is purely born from a compounded culture of ignorance, mistaken
                pretence,
                and by all that, an evident lack of inquiry —for none without the clasp of common consent, thinks purely
                and
                sees people as anything but equal.
                <br>&emsp;And thankfully, the validity of the ancient ways gave way to the want of something more
                reputable
                and modern; by which pure attempts were made (with modern means) to assess the world and what it means.
                Whereby, the notion of religion remains, but beyond ancient views; along with liberty becoming present;
                and
                developing truly by the friction of precedence, and at that the world’s status as would permit
                (admittedly
                young liberal) views that bore complete equity.
                <br>&emsp;We have reached this purity though. At least, we as in those common and or reminiscent of the
                West. Here, and by all alike, the affairs and being of sexes, orients, faiths and ethnic identities hold
                worthwhile truth; and by that, are accounted for equally within the basis by which collective virtue
                lay.
                “For there are none who we’d call man, who do not measure to the status of members, and at that
                contributors
                to citizenry and rule.”
                <br>&emsp;It is only our nearly modern case, whereby the finishings of this war (of new and ancient) is
                but
                a battlefield of wounded and deprived. For indeed the battle for humanity is won. At least our demise is
                all
                together. And beyond the cares for our lasting time as one’s whole and of unity, so is such union full
                of
                stragglers, and at that those bolted behind. For some can not even partake in the liberties now given.
                “For
                many paths require one to be so tall, liquid, able.” And the result of those liberties being unpresent
                prior, means that some people have nothing -and thus have no means to begin.
                <br>&emsp;I am not sure if this is just part of the collective, that it would account for and service
                what
                it can those who were let down by its prior inefficiency. Veterans seem to be treated this way. At that
                point though, besides the efficiency of our fortunes and excess, what is the course for those with
                nothing?
                What resources and or opportunities are available for people in that state? “In this newly open world,
                where
                is the potential for those whose first step is to begin?”

                What is the purpose of all our efforts? Is it not the liberty of all, to see and do as they please?
                <br>&emsp;Perhaps, it is truly bring our nature in line with that the world, for harmony. There the gift
                of
                virtue lies, in liberty namely, and at that peace.
                <br>&emsp;But the ebbs of our nature is such that the attempt to harmonize brings fear; as our
                motivations
                based on mystery bear upon us further confusion, and at that reserve. By some mechanic the truth comes
                out,
                and our hesitance seeps.
                <br>&emsp;I just wonder if we always knew that there were no Gods, and that the mechanics which bore us
                need
                for breathe also bore the air and currents, that the efficacy in meeting such needs would be a complete
                and
                utter success. For I believe the tales tell us that meeting the demands of our animal needs bore insight
                to
                further problems: namely death and the pleasing of God. But so much of the reoncilliation with that has
                created depravity, ‘as everyone push each other aside in order to reach the top’.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the aim is always reconciliation, but of our nature with the world. In that lies
                an
                evident prosperity.
                <br>&emsp;The oddity of man is in his attempts to solve ‘ancient problems’ -as compared to those
                primitive
                and innate, that much of the struggle to modernity arrived.
                <br>&emsp;In a broad sense, the peril of the stone age was in those unable to harmonize with nature
                -whereby
                they’d starve and whither. While the modern peril is one where people fight each other, ‘like two babies
                yanking at the same toy’. The motive is the same, but the ancient sentiments bring false pretence to
                ‘others’, and their right to be, or at least be equal.
                <br>&emsp;I do admit some ignorance in the function, or at least mechanism by which fear is produced.
                But I
                submit the notion of a nightmare, and how impressionability, unfamiliarity, and an otherwise lack of
                similar
                (if not associated) definition, can lead to such conception. “If only in a dream.” But so, in life, can
                we
                be misled, or mistaken at least, and by that deem something to be problematic; or at least feel a
                problem is
                present. “For it is not a far stretch to describe earlier points of man, where he not only say the
                volcano
                as a threat, but an instigator of it.”
                <br>&emsp;If were thinking ideally, or at least in terms of virtue, then we can presume the notion of
                communal harmony, or group relations, and how the mistaken actions were done in such relations, or at
                least
                internally following combination.
                <br>&emsp;In that way, it is hard not to say that if your part of a community, and some of its members
                are
                suffering from previous struggle, that your part of the collective is in helping them. At least, as you
                act
                with the collective in mind in positivity, so ought you act with it in mind if there are parts of it
                which
                have succumb to negativity. “Normally, we win, and share the spoils; and collective virtue is submitting
                yourself as to be equal to others. But if we loose, then we at best hold eacother up in our loss, and
                persevere through the trouble. And if some of us are fine, then perhaps our role is to help those who
                are
                not."

                Our liberty is a weird thing, for we never truly have it. Even if we thought, ‘well, how lucky are we,
                to
                have this job, these means, and the life that goes with it’, so would other hurdles come our way; for
                our
                finances don’t impact our vulnerability to sickness, injury, loss, nor death. And at that, the actual
                quality of our lives, in terms of the means of it all being agreeable and light, and the good in it
                being
                accessible, broadening and scrumptious, does not come via cash.
                <br>&emsp;What I ultimately seek is stability. For my contributions are one thing, and indeed the core
                of
                our life is screaming for such purpose. But this really comes because of an inability to be ourselves;
                which
                I can only say comes about due to the choices we’ve made.
                <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, we’ve become generous and wise. And in doing so, we’ve invited
                indifference
                or critique; and at that, error in our way leave us vulnerable to such friction. But the primary course
                we’ve taken is one that has oriented itself based on those experiences; whereby what was good was that
                which
                came from our propriety, while the bad was either in the erros of such ways or the conflict which such
                state
                of ours brought. Just as we are averse to television and chicken, so are we withdrawn from the conduct
                of
                others. Who I care not if they are not great; nor do I mind their indifference. But when my actions
                become
                an imposition towards them, or they simply refute and or deny the choice I’ve made and their worth, then
                I
                feel like our environment is hostile. “Like a gay man walking around, acting straight, but feeling
                resentful
                that their expression is necessarily dull —by fear at least.”
                <br>&emsp;But via this course, despite its wonder and glee, so have we departed from the common rungs of
                life. We have no real relationships, nor are we involve with anything beside our interests; that, and we
                have no profession or civil means. And beyond the wish to validate myself, and at that settle into the
                ‘indifference’ which I experience from others —as to remove such negativity, and take part with them
                (from
                our confidence)—
                <br>&emsp;What I have is a path which knows its place, and holds little regret or pretence as to the
                confines ahead. I see however, that our choice is in front of us; and indeed, as one dreams of a
                profession,
                or a home, or travel, so do I see an end of stability; for in that, we can rest, knowing that such peace
                we’ll have. And, like all paths, it becomes easier in the present knowing that your on one; for current
                choices have a propriety which is not purely based, but built into some course forward. “Giving a permit
                to
                liberty and rest, for we see where else were obliged.”
                <br>&emsp;As it were, reaching that peaceful part of the path is simple as being where I can be myself.
                And
                indeed, this is not a point of absence, merely appropriation. For my parent’s are no longer suitable
                roommates; as their lack of overlap with any basic property is one that makes the kind of actions we
                take
                around them, dry. So I mean not to live at home. And I will admit that when I think of where too then,
                that
                the idea of a place with many other things is exciting.
                <br>&emsp;But it really is a scenario of stability which I seek. The garments of opportunity and fun are
                nice, but appeal little to me in our greatest gait. I really just want a place that is hospitable, and
                at
                that lush. For any place will do; and living with your mom and dad will always permit the least room,
                ‘for
                their nature per the family is one of unbridled intimacy; as they treat you not like a person, but a
                son, a
                family member; yet they also act with free admittance, as if nothing is expected of them’. And indeed
                this
                is often fine, for I don’t mind being agreeable and pertinent. But so in our imperfect ways, and even
                the
                expression of the propriety into our thriving state, is one that hardly finds productive reception; or
                plain
                acceptance.
                <br>&emsp;In that sense, I mean not to live with our family. It is just to hard to be myself. And the
                benefits of doing so are not sufficent anymore considering they afford. Nothing which we could otherwise
                do
                is worth being averse towards. And seeing as the gain of being at home (and free) was that so we could
                concentrate on me, so is the constancy of that wishing for a place to actually be, ‘for the development
                is
                cemented’. That, and the freedom which afforded this is no longer a surplus over the required efforts to
                support ourself. Those efforts are in some ways rewarding, and beneficial at that; but so is their
                demand
                not so drearing anymore, considering our strength form such constancy. And I felt this before, but
                whatever
                toil there was, held worth by the nature of the being which such efforts supported.
                <br>&emsp;In that sense, I will keep to our path of personal propriety; for even beyond the nurturing of
                it,
                so are the goods around it able to sunk into. Preference then, in terms of locale and flow of itinerary,
                is
                part of this process, in that of our every day, so ought the goods and duty around mesh with our
                propitious
                efforts and craft. “I seek a place that would, in full, house and or enrich our common pace of being.”
                <br>&emsp;Further, the breadth of our expression is in par with the desires one seeks. In that, of the
                good
                there may be abundance,but so in our time there may be romance, friendship, expertise and broader
                virtue.
                These things are inky though, as their promise may be a draw to your idle passions. But so, prior to the
                extent of such ambition -in business, power, fame, credulity- lies those former elements, of which your
                ordinary place in society can procure. For desire, with a the smell of that which otherwise draws our
                passion, so do these occupations rise. And indeed, I may not feel or care for such passions and
                occupations.
                But increasingly at least, beyond the zeal of our propriety, is a sort of excess in character that
                allows
                for communal participation; whereby the moderate act of making friends, attending meet ups or group
                chats,
                even putting yourself out there for romance, become fair and tenuale.

                I find myself souly frustrated with my parents because of their lack of interest in what I want. They'd
                jump
                in front of a car to save me, and are quite generous at that, but they rarely ask me waht things I want,
                or
                what I am apprehnesive about.
                <br>&emsp;Much of my later adolescnece has come about through me trying to clarify such notions. Which,
                to
                be clear, was never about affirming it to my parents, but rather solidifying it to myself. It is true
                that I
                have spoken with them from time to time, and over the years, our general interests have reached a point
                that
                they understand. But for the most part, our lack of rich cooperativness with them, or core
                understanding,
                only made me eager to cement whatever such things were. If we had been asked more about such things,
                then we
                might have been fine to sit with the common understanding. Seeing as there wasn't any, I sought to
                explore
                and define what things were.
                <br>&emsp;The point being, that I did so out of fear, but also anger, in that the basis for suggestions
                I'd
                receive felt off --deep inside at least. And so I sought to clarify, as not to smittenly revoke, but
                rather
                clarify the strong grounds my inclings were felt to be.
                <br>&emsp;Where I stand now is on a world stage, completey fine in our views of myself, family and
                community. But so the rest of humanity lay. And indeed, our parents lack of regard for me when it comes
                to
                my interest or care for such things, curries me into defining that for myself. As the central theme of
                this,
                as that so long as your part of a family, so will older memebrs have influence over you; and as much as
                you
                don't appear in harmony, so will you feel apprhensive. And as it happens, our escepade into personal
                defintiion, only led me to live freely in such a way. But given our choices, so are we at home with our
                parents; and from that, there broader views are crossing mine. And because they feel so off from those
                of
                mine which spring from our own deep propiety, I have then worked to define such broader views: if only
                to
                rest and or converse in a truly sincere way.
                <br>&emsp;On one hand you have the everlasting struggle to agree, and the fair course of inquiry is not
                one
                that many exhibit. If I wish to live peacefully though, or at least with decency amidst our proper place
                within the world, then so ought I know what that means. In that lies our fidelity to the enormity of the
                world, and our reproach to the all extensive contents in it. Remarking on such material is where I hold
                my
                tongue, and at best think, or learn; while the address and adherence to the broader structural fact, is
                where my propiety lies. Indeed, if I had a moral truth, then the specifics of such structure could be
                sought, or driven towards at least. But so much as I am in this formative state, so do I at least rest
                on
                the fact that of such enormity (in strucutre), the world is.
                <br>&emsp;This is all in part due to our struggle in being alone. For by whicever roots, we have
                prioritized
                knowing ourself, and at that the world which we are angled against; and of such demonstration of who we
                are.
                Which, to be clear, has never been fought over. But in our formative ways, whereby we are in a state of
                further finding who we are, that is where disharmony is found. For most people I deal with, have no
                sense of
                further finding themselves. And as such, it is as if their waiting for me to finally reach who I am, and
                thus be. "For action is all they care about."
                <br>&emsp;Ultimately, I am stuck between the solitude of my choices, and the novel ways of expressing my
                propiety. Such ways have only come in retrospect, and our common moments are ones of self interest and
                practice. In this state though, the future is perhaps all to clear yet far, and as we wait to go where
                we
                are fair to be, we see the everpresent process of being ourself as one of disharmony. For in such state,
                we
                are not entirely sure who we are; and indeed, this constant questioning is from our choices, in that
                whoever
                we are, we cannot entirely express that at home. "And deeper down the inquiry lays."

                Understanding is a strange thing, as I only seek it when we are without forward motion. Naturally, our
                being
                goes, at least with nature's flow. But when were stiff, or stuffy from the ebbs of our current day, so
                do I
                seek some sort of bond with the world.
                <br>&emsp;What I find, is that without some sort of grip on things, I whither, or hanker for such a
                grasp,
                and at that feel restless: as if I am seeking, or tightly holding on. While I am, in being that is, so
                is
                the world there, for my action is amdist something, like friction or air drafts that lift a kite.
                Generally
                speaking I feel this while I am truly alive, and such an expereince exhibits to me the proper course to
                be.
                "As if I were a bird who had never flew, but then caught a gust of wind and took full flight: by which I
                knew who I was, what I was right to be doing, and at that, what nature was in my righthouess in terms of
                me:
                and, per the basis of nature whiich produced my own specific sort, so did the heart of nature lay. As if
                a
                layer soul rooted in by a tree, and the trunk which held our particular branch."
                <br>&emsp;But understanding, is something which strikes me in our less than soaring state. For in such
                case,
                my senses are at one with the medium, and by that, my urge to know is absent, for I already am --and
                seek
                thus not. But then even, when I hit a riley gust, and am carried without needing to flap, or simply find
                a
                perch to rest, I reflect, settle, and at that, see the milder portions of life amidst me, having been
                already amongst the broader currents which broad my fullest self to be.
                <br>&emsp;This is like life in a way, that without the deeper prescence of living, so can little build
                off
                of that, and sprout. "There can be no moss without a tree."
                <br>&emsp;And what I've noticed incessantly over the years, is that life is not something which is best
                defined by some core statement of nature or me, but a sort of character which permitts itself to be as
                it is
                whole-hearteldy; whereby the primary modes of its being reach full stride, thereby giving a sort of life
                to
                the body as a whole. By that, it is able to exist, 'as if therre were some neccessary amount of
                momentum,
                for it would otherwise stop and cease'.
                <br>&emsp;Through that, though I can not entirely say, lies what can only be described as more novel and
                or
                muted motions within nature, and at that an association with the sides of nature which pair with such
                milder
                ways. This is akin to a bull, in that it moves in a way that reflects its horns, and the modes of
                defense
                and or fighting; or a lion and its nature to hunt, or Man and his nature to craft and inquire. But ought
                death be part of this, or sleep, rest, satiety? These are like a sword in its sheathe, in that totally,
                the
                sword is the same, yet considered to be via its core function to swing and strike; whereupon its
                exhibition
                of its proper self, bears it a sort of existence which is constant, if not propelled and or in motion by
                being itself: and all beings need rest. At least, if there was nothing which drew the need of a sword to
                strike, then it would likely be left on the shelf, for it had no need to be; but in use, it has its
                sheathe,
                where it exists complimentary to its primary purpose.
                <br>&emsp;I cannot say though. For I believe that our fears guide our tradition, and by that, less we
                commensurate antiquated ways, then we are left without an understanding of our own. This is so, for life
                is
                not always demanding, in a way which we cannot help but address.
                <br>&emsp;Our choices have come from fortune, in that our own propiety could be focused on. We needed no
                room to do this, but saw value where fortune permitted.
                <br>&emsp;Again and again it comes back to our own thinking. In that, without the truth of the world, or
                some inquriy into that, we are left with the irksome despair of not being ourself. For without such
                motion,
                we are subject to others misfortune, raw mentality, cheap contentment, and rude monerging and
                discipline. By
                our counts, we saw and harmonized ourself with the hues of nature which seemed both bright and
                resounding,
                'and cared little for what seemed but reflections'. In this though lies the harshest way; for there is
                both
                too little which we can afford to ignore or benefit from.
                <br>&emsp;Perhaps then I will say. Whatever life is, there is nothing which explains it that a miracle
                or
                moral reasoning serves. As we understand the prescence of disease and orbits around the sun, so does our
                search for deeper truth hold promise. But from what I can tell, the investigation into this is still
                present, and at that any artfull expression or iqnuriy about it. In fact it is all too contemporary for
                the
                former aspect to be overlooked. "And for those in search to be unaware of their beleif that the final
                anwser
                is right around the corner."
                <br>&emsp;We are so confident though, as if the topics of interest we hold so dear, are seen by me
                without
                tradition in mind. I take for granted that we will die, and by that seek some sort of grasp on the
                matter.
                But in all truth, where my heart lies is in the preciousness of our experience, the felicity of it, and
                the
                grand serenity whhich tailors the entire way. This is indeed hard to describe, 'as a deep and shallow
                breath
                are not something so clear or common to compare'. Yet, the birth of wisdom sits in the cradle of
                persoonal
                knowledge, and the propitous sense that durnkedness, poor punctuality and senseless shame and sedition
                all
                lead to uneven and course life. While honesty, virtue and the dearest care exhibit the purest of
                strenghts
                and sobriety; the latter being the spring for one's relation with the world. "I just can't illustrate
                the
                way that I breathe deeply when the birds are singing, compared to one's obvious pleasure in mac n
                cheese."

                The core of me may be someone who is lazy, concieted and ashamed.
                <br>&emsp;The root of this may be born of something which does not damn me in being such a way; but
                still
                the effect lies.
                <br>&emsp;The struggle in being yourself is an odd thing. For we are all more or less raised, and at
                that
                asked to be something; and as much as we aren't we are ushered, and of the route we take, the affront to
                others expectation returns us with shame.
                <br>&emsp;And indeed, there is a sort of comfort we experienced throughout our youth, of which we held
                no
                other care for in terms of broader/future concerns. When such points were brought infront of us, the
                importance of them had me feeling a little small and unsure --considering our lack of grip on them.
                <br>&emsp;But with content I flew, drifting through the days, 'letting the future's prompts arrive'.
                <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, our choices along the way made me less able and interested towards such
                prompts. And our mild grasp on them drew discontent from others.
                <br>&emsp;I can only describe our personal propiety as being born from such dissaray; as we ultimately
                steared away from the heart of such conflict, or rather the position which others were fighting with me
                about. Their acceptence was not whole, but so did our lack of commensuration draw their swords not.
                <br>&emsp;Where do I begin then, along this path of being me. There is much in the way of self doubt and
                gratuity, but so our finer sense parlays. In that, we are rewarded for our actions and the pastural
                continuiation of them. We are also reminded by our debts and dings, and the redeeming commission to
                learn.
                <br>&emsp;People's words sting, especially when we are in a state of doubt and flux. The very fact that
                we
                are uncemented, at our age, is something which emitts an ambience of disent from others. And the care of
                mine is to understand the progress of becoming ourself, but through constant ebbs of failing and
                learning,
                and by that refining what it means to be me, that so are there moments were, upon those slips, and on
                route
                to a new ideal, we are not.
                <br>&emsp;In those moments our stair is perhaps a bit too glaring, as if the norms of our high self are
                held
                by a tight brace, rather than pure assembly. And generally, our oddities come to light then, as we are
                awkward in our austerity, and at that all to nimble in avoiding conflict. "Which, in our stiff and
                changing
                state, is all more apparent: as interactions with immaleable things is more senstive then those which
                easily
                move." It is one thing to share that you are trying this or reaching for that; and another to say that
                you
                are trying such things at all, or being in such a way that of such things, your distance from them
                appropraites an unfinished state. Generally I speak of this as a attitude which makes for change, and
                committs.
                <br>&emsp;Theres just this apprhension by your being yourself. And being around others who you feel
                subject
                to share such things, but feel averse, makes me feel like hiding. Those who are unassuming, as in most
                strangers, and not your family, makes such a state unimposed. But the issue really, is not so much that
                you
                need privacy, but an admittence of who you are. For being is hard when you are not allowing your
                strides.
                And it is not too uncommon to find yourself hindered by past miscommunication.
                <br>&emsp;The heart of the matter lies in the fact that everything about me is weird. I don't use
                social, I
                don't listen to lyrical music, I don't watch the news, dramas, sports or twitch; nor do I vote, read
                much of
                fiction, comment on the videos I do watch; and at that, I hold no dualistic conception of mind or death,
                nor
                do I believe in any graphical represnetaion of culture or violence; I play games, and old ones at that,
                read
                books, and very old ones at that; I write, decently, and of myself and natural things; I sit on the
                floor
                while doing this, along with games, watching film, fiddling with my computer, and then I sleep there
                too;
                I've never had coffee or soda in any meaningfull way, nor have I had a soar throat since my reign or
                propiety started. I have no job, and own little regard for getting one beyond the simple wages and
                active
                kind of work; I am content with a room, walking reguarly, seeing the sun, sky and moon, hearing the
                birds,
                the wind, the rustle of trees; nor do I have any deep and or detailed reservations about children,
                equities
                or relations being commiserate with such ways. Theres simply too much difference locally and afar, for
                me to
                think that others could not agree with me and commiserate; and by my shifting hand too. In all entirety,
                I
                want and am unaverse to things uncommon, awkward, lacking custom or tradition.
                <br>&emsp;A man though, is one, in a mature sense, who holds himself to the ways in which he naturally
                moves
                and truly is. And in this commisery, the prominet note which he sings is one of understanding; where he
                sees, by the otherwise fear of being expliclty different, that others also are. And by that, he
                realizes,
                that the source of his quirkiness and reproach is not in the material of his ways, but his secrecy and
                hiding. "It is seldom the man we know who seems perverse and or dangerous, but those who are
                mysterious."
                <br>&emsp;As Plato says and all wise men who've followed, 'know thyself', for the world seems clear and
                even, commesnurable to your case, and at that, ignorant of who you really are. Like all those with
                paranio,
                the source is in the sense that your appear shift and mysterious: but this is so, for you are a blurr to
                yourself, unsure, undefined, and at that, flat in motion and expression. "By which over concentration
                and
                defense accrue beneath your hidden state; or your limber around, tight, anxious, scared to speak or be
                seen."
                <br>&emsp;I see in this though, that one's natural gait paired with their prompt and or interest in
                speaking, along with the peace within oneself as to in stillness be happy, merge together to form the
                vector
                of being through the world. For one's choices marshal their way, and as a harsh aversion to crack
                cocaine is
                laudible, so are midler yet common matters derseving of equal discretion. And doing so in seemingly fair
                ways, can orient your paces through the world and where you go. But so, it seems, that less you
                conciliate
                with your equity, personal or of family, have the luck of chance or invested reward or have the
                annuities of
                the times, then so will you have to commesnurate yourself in a worldly way. Doing so requires
                communication,
                and be it guilded by interest or neccessity, so ought you flaunter and cooperate. For in need, so lies
                the
                latter; and in the goods of friendship and chatter, lie the latter. And for sure, having one without the
                other beckons the holder to bear the other's load. "If I am unfriendly, then our communcation will lack
                chemistry and free expression; and if I am uncoopeartive, then we will be seperated, and at that left to
                make ourselves anew."

                Oh meaning, how to crowd my attempts to write. For I cannot just say what things are, but what they
                mean.
                <br>&emsp;In that, I see that the nature of us being is one of constant repute, as the land around
                weighs on
                our otheewise personal effort; and of those who think such things are importnat, that they condem me for
                not
                attending to them especially.
                <br>&emsp;More or less though, our being is such that in full motion, we are brimming, cheerfull,
                endeared
                to all. Lacking concrete pleasures, from sex and sugar; but doth beauty lay.
                <br>&emsp;Besides the quality of our experience, it is neccessary for us to know the form which such
                motion
                takes. For it is not a grabbing sort of action or care, but one of managment and solidity: whereby the
                inputs of life far and around, speak to us, and brighten our day. "And our efforts are in keeping us
                intune
                and light as to recieve such gifts."
                <br>&emsp;I will attest to the conflict and friction which this sort of living procures; as others, by
                their
                own fear and shame or not, usher me to be more obligate to the world as opposed to ourself. In their
                aim,
                the world is what we seek, and ought we be and orient ourelves to acquire it. While my aim is to to
                wholesomely be, and let what the world offer itself in the way that those whose mere eligibility (and
                construct) bears them to see it.
                <br>&emsp;In this though, by development surely, lies a risk of contradiction, whereby you are yourself
                and
                accordingly tuned, but thereby seek the world, as either a consolation for the struggles in being
                yourself,
                or to validate your otherwise personal aim --and remove any outside contempt.
                <br>&emsp;Outside this contradiction, lies our personal path. And affirmation, or understadning at
                least,
                bears us a sort of steadyness as we go through time. For I mean to make friends, foster relationships,
                romance even. But I am aware that our self interest does not warrant me such things, either practically
                or
                because I am special. What I resort to thnking then, is that, in order to be myself, ought I lay within
                the
                mere sociable mean, whereby I am friendly, kind and cooperative, and not prone to fancies or expecations
                born of my ego and loins. From that, I can simply be, and let the world collaspue naturally. For there
                is no
                trouble in being yourself, if the communion of such thing exhibits itself sociably. But in terms of
                relationships, or meaningfull connection, so does expereience line an easier way, in that you learn how
                to
                usher these at all; but so do you let things happen, whereby the merrit of relations, in that their is
                something to bond people, comes by you being integral enough to warrant a bond between somewhat
                relatable.
                There is no merrit in saying that the way you are will not be bondable with others. For the broadest of
                friends comes from the broadest of relations; and I surley lack no friends, but a friendship. And by
                that,
                our commradery with folk as it pertains to our passing by or needed prescence amongst them, barrs me the
                neccessary sociability and cooperation; but not any need to make actual friends. Besides the activites
                which
                such pairings exhibit, I don't have much interest in those sort of things to begin with. I am more set,
                content and indebted to ourself. What I really care for, or am drawn to is meaningfull relationships, or
                deeper ones; whereby the point of relation is not from some activity, but based on who we are. To be
                fair,
                activites are varied, and thus some may bring us together in a way I'm fine with. But, to be clear, it
                is
                more about recreation which draws such interest, rather than festivities and celebration. No matter,
                when it
                comes to deeper relations, so does this come from you connecting in a meaningfull way. And no matter who
                you
                are, your not going to do this with an abundance of people. For in terms of depth, so will only a
                certain
                person pertain. I feel this is natural for all people; and my personal stake, is one of sociability
                amongst
                collegues, a more honest and at ease communication with peers --as to solidify and or expand shared
                interests- and a true and open fact of possibility in relations, no matter our differences. "I care
                little
                if none relate to me in terms of our non-interest in dinner. Which meaningfull relationship is sprung
                from
                such a thing anyway." And indeed, how we are on our own is one thing as remarks these ordianry things;
                but
                the point which draws others together, affords both acceptence of those things, and alterations to make
                such
                connection work. But they don't foster or deny the connection.

                Were all artists in a way, whether that be in paints, words, bravado. But there lies the prevalence of
                supposition, and the alternate view from inquiry. For the illustrations of craftsmen and pundants is not
                in
                itself right or wrong, but merely an expression from prior experience. I know not what that is from; and
                indeed credulity lies as a sort of inherent merrit.
                <br>&emsp;Where I lie though, is that whoever says this or that I care not, but of those who listen, so
                are
                they the thorns in my side. For my take on one thing, perhaps uncommon, leaves me somewhat hanging for
                conflict with those who see things ordianrly, or at least otherwise. And at any rate, I feel strange
                seeing
                the world so differenlty; and partciuarly, if my roots are better, or at least well staked, then the
                contrariety of that to someone less founded, yet perhaps in a position of authoirty or influence
                (relative
                to me or in general), leaves me fearing conflict, or a hidden sense of pirvate truth; which itself leads
                to
                a sort of condensation of purjury, 'like my beliefs were without woarrant, or unlikely to be heard'.
                Indeed
                I could speak to the rampat simplicity of all far things, and the illusroy swarm of feelings and
                conviction
                to boot.
                <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, our reflective path can pave the way through such thicket.
                <br>&emsp;In that, I see, that in whole, or near at least to entirety, lies the current of the world; of
                which we are right to oblige, and thereby earn the goods from such connection --in what is appropriate.
                <br>&emsp;I must admiit though, that the details of such view are not well defined. For the motions of
                those
                around me are not but what seems common; and so any notion of an ideal is not in itself a guide for
                action,
                but ointment to uncertainty.
                <br>&emsp;In a truly inquistive way, we remark what is par for the course of our nature, but of the
                posture
                and pace through such lane. The idea that family, death and governance are imperatives needs no dispute;
                but
                of such things and our resolve, ought reason and honesty conjure our oblige.
                <br>&emsp;In the end, nothing matters; at least little can be attributed to the nature of particles and
                fields. No matter, as Hume fairly said, that be it the componetns of the matrix or the strands of a
                dream,
                that what we notice is equal to the appartus in which we judge; and by that, we take to mean that no
                matter
                the nature of things below, so are our regards (in breadth at least) born of such nature; to which we
                resign
                our deepest doubts to our own evident nature within that whole.
                <br>&emsp;In this sense, we have the peculiar concept of reflection, or awareness, in that we not only
                react
                to things via our bodie's form, but consider, determine, grow. This can be explained by the lineage of
                thought, and its birth from baser sensation. But removing the core nature which produces such phenomena,
                and
                listening merely to the content, which in all fairness the senses form are made of, so do we have the
                subjects of memory, desire, habit and fear. And perhaps, via modernity, we have literature -in
                impressions
                and expression- which let us more acutely grow.
                <br>&emsp;But so the world lay, and us, in experience and understanding around that. As we rightly take
                for
                granted the core basis of things, and at the very least act on the principles of Hume, so can we extend
                such
                station with an acceptence of our means to learn and know, and at that find suitable paths and
                execution. By
                that, our enviroment, in location and time, will determine what material we respect, and at that
                formulate
                ourselves against.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed our fear lies in the ways of the past, and the oblige we have based on a unset inquiry:
                for
                without our own application and fortuity, so does such novelty remove me from other's arrangment: which
                itself invites critique and abasement. But neverhtless, there is but a mere practical matter of
                appropriation in terms of being yourself, and not being so ill set or kept amidst people and their ways.
                <br>&emsp;What I can see is that the world is large. And albeit it fast, durations of time hold much
                quantity. And holding myself to some integrity of depth, I care little for nor am I concivted towards,
                any
                person, place or thing whose quality of existence I merely suppose. "Otherwise every bug likely stepped
                on,
                would grind away at me, as if the world was melting all in its claim." To be fair though, this mark of
                propiety is one that affords little unintegrity, 'for our own ignornace falls prey to the shallow crys
                of
                other people, whereby we feel alone in our mystery, yet pressed by the pleas of other people; which
                itself
                makes more our own fear and worry of those subject to their concerns'.
                <br>&emsp;If we take this concept and apply it to the fortunes of other people, and the conduct of
                others as
                well, then all that is left is our perosonal lives. By that, there is but family, and the extension of
                friends and relations. Foremost, there is what you already have, in guardians and siblings, and what you
                are
                more or less natured to acquire, namely whoever you are a guardian off, and another who is in the same
                state
                as you. "A partner if you will." Friends are those you find relevance towards, in that you share
                something
                in common; be it goals, interests, ideals. Whereas relationships are born from connection; in that, be
                it
                through some activity or task, you don't merely spend time together doing it, only then to return to
                your
                core life, but rather they are part of that. In the deepest sense they come with you; while those who
                may be
                mere close friends, are but part of it. But my collegue at work who I talk games with, or another who I
                play
                diablo every so often, these are but friends who I do something with. As much of a relationship as there
                is,
                so may your personal lives be exchanged; but it is a more full on relationship if they come to dinner,
                meet
                your family, hold some meaning to you in the way that they understand your truth, or engage with you
                while
                your in trouble and despair.
                <br>&emsp;Everyone else is but a portion of our kindred spirit; in that if help was needed, I would
                attempt
                to be. But our allowence to them is merely in kindness, not interest or itinerary.
                <br>&emsp;Assuming there is no moral obligation for you to become a docotr or fireman, nor donate and or
                protest for the sake of some stranger in Botswana, then your interests really have full luxury. Indeed,
                it
                is a primary fact, that your actions would follow what is layed out in the law. And by that at least, so
                would your actions be fair if aggressive violence or larseny were not committed. Though it is tricky to
                estimate the requirment for defence, when the motives by the assailents is traditionally wrong. And
                beyond
                that, if your efforts and content is concillitroy to public actions which are deemed good for the
                public,
                then your position is good.
                <br>&emsp;There is a matter of contribution though. And per our history, any idea of right and wrong, or
                real commisery, came when we are about to be grown up; meaning that we had to nourishment that prime
                statement in our older years. Ideally, perhaps, we'd be full and grown and in the motions by the time
                were
                of a higher age. And from that, maybe we'd contriubte. Of this I cannot entirely say. For there is the
                matter of children, and the contribution which one's commitment to that can only afford. The right time
                for
                a child is definitiely one where that appointment is porperly met; but so may that moment be one where
                broader contribbutions are applicable. Let's say that youth is the primer for being, and adulthood the
                expression of such being. I don't see children as a starting project for adulthood, but rather something
                which your fully realized self takes on. "You learn grammar, write, then teach; and having children upon
                the
                completion of youth, feels like your learning to be yourself in order to then raise another: all the
                while,
                your actually being has not been." At least, the handling of another, whose nature is formed and aimed
                comparable to your own, does not seem like something which, in handling, you become yourself; but
                rather,
                something which earns a hand which has already become steady.
                <br>&emsp;And in that way, by the worlds need at least, ought one contribute upon materliazing themself,
                and
                in that prioritize such contribution prior to having children; or should they have children as their
                prime
                fruit of able contribution, then attend to the world in their later years? To be clear, neither needs
                the
                other to be completed. That is, I don't see rearing children to be a requisite for broader contribution;
                nor
                is attending to the world the requisite to then have children. It is one thing to learn the basics then
                apply yourself, but it is not strictly so, that of the aim which earns your truest abilitly --upon such
                application- that this should either A) be something essential, nor B) be something which preceds
                something
                else eseential.

                if anything true was so because someone you knew told it.
                <br>&emsp;And at any rate, what we see as the course of propogration for family, and what we'd teach
                those
                ahead, is not in line with what came before. I'd say, that the general school of life has pruned those
                of an
                older sort; and squeezed out a sort of grumbled acceptence by those more recent. But our view of things
                is
                helmed by reason: for only so much of what I heard could be adhered to. And at that, as I cared little
                for
                more than what I felt, so did the futures expecation wain.
                <br>&emsp;It is an odd thing though, for our personal interests don't mean lethargy and at that
                privation.
                But in tending to priotize such things, there is not always an emphasis on the further things in life.
                <br>&emsp;To be fair though, much of my life has been charged with personal care, with the effect being
                one
                of choice. In that, our position at various time never held much more than novelty, and so we could go
                where
                chance or fortune brought us. And, as it were, the persoanl care and propiety which I sought and
                flourished
                from, held no damning limitation, particulary at home.
                <br>&emsp;For all are reared and prepped to go. But it is another thing to say there is discontent from
                such
                environment, and beyond the need to leave, they seek it.
                <br>&emsp;For me, there were large droubts of content where I was at home, sipping off of our wider
                family
                fortune. Although there was occasional struggle, and our interest to be elsewhere gained, so was it a
                rather
                even period where I could focus on and relish myself.
                <br>&emsp;Because of this, our choices were never marshalled to any further end; nor, in times where we
                were
                independant, did we cement ourselves enough to naturally extend that way.
                <br>&emsp;Some may forget, but often the return home is one of need or offer, in that by our novel state
                within a new place, so did the mere interest of being there not warrant any sense of permanency. Growth
                could occur, and indeed it often did. But by the whims of others and thier interest, my less than solid
                place was seen malleable. "Small needs of others then drew me, as neither party was reserved in changing
                place --in ask, or response."
                <br>&emsp;I would note then the friction of communcation during our independancy. For upon those periods
                of
                solidutde -and at home- we generally sought soemthing new and further. In this, to be fair, there were
                the
                minglings of dreams and destiny; along with the promise of change from the common mundaness and
                turbulence
                of being so close to family. While we did change in such ways, and earned much preference, there was
                always
                this sense of holding back from rushing forth. "As if some deeper plea to make the future more clear and
                defined came about, as the present was only clearer in being on our own. Our independance brought more
                certainty to the effects of our actions."
                <br>&emsp;The trouble though, beyond ignorance, was that our fair attempt to proceed rationally, and at
                that
                contendely ahead, held a more apparent disdain from those around. Not, to be clear, in words, but our
                apprehension; as if our resolve within true being held the sense that others would find faults. Or,
                better
                said, that as our independance prompted us to further be ourself, that the concession to more truly and
                happily be, and not reach further and extend, drew embarrsement and contention from others (our sense at
                least). For it has never been my experienece that the ways and or good of virtue, integrity,
                deliberation or
                inquiry were either respected, praised, understood, or entirely accepted.
                <br>&emsp;It is better to say that our being within such ways fell somewhat in line with the results
                that
                other common modes of being were measured against. And by that, some understanding and accpetence grew.
                But
                upon independance, we felt somewhat condemend for being our selves moreso.
                <br>&emsp;One insight is that in such a course, of propiety that is, there tends to be less around which
                is
                either of interest of hospitable. And because of that, there is more reason to be yourself, and thus
                less
                involved with such things. "As if we were otherwise gasping for air, and held our breathe tigher; only
                though, to let go of the world around. Yet, we'd still see it, but from our point of view, as opposed to
                some future ahead."
                <br>&emsp;Where this has changed, is that what we see as contrary to being, is not itself so linited.
                Nor,
                is that state which we measure things agasint, based on avarice, fear or fame. In that, we see that our
                being has both time and place to exist and become. By that, there seems a fair lane ahead, full of
                different
                assortments of regard. Which bears much ease to the present.

                If you would, let us talk of butter and bread. For one is the matter, the substance of your life. But
                this,
                is not so clear, for do I mean the beat of your heart, the cheer in your way; or are we speaking of the
                task
                which draws such umph, or the field in which you glee.
                <br>&emsp;We might say, that the latter notion is remarked in terms of bread, and butter the former.
                <br>&emsp;In that way, we can speak of life in general, and ours specifically.
                <br>&emsp;First, I must submitt that our plate is enriched with the savourisest of cream, salted finely,
                and
                kept thick and fresh. And although our loaf is not so large, so is it of the purest seed; thorough
                grain,
                ample crust, but not in a way that makes you feel thick and rough, but rather firm, crackly, malleable
                to a
                pleasent degree. Thus my life is lined.
                <br>&emsp;In general though, it is not at all an unimportant point that we'd remark upon the means to
                'churning' said cream. For life, as opposed to the fortune of family, is like wind on the crust, eroding
                it,
                thinning it, making it stale and dirty. And while the latter notion remarks the dollops of bran and
                grain,
                so is it the seasoning and condiment which makes it come alive. For a tired old man is not brought to
                the
                same level of cheer in even the most wonderous ways; but those who are at peace, but firmly happy and
                set,
                see more, and at that what would not be seen in less than preferable moments.
                <br>&emsp;It is true that a lack of family, home and friends will seperate one from what is deeply
                desired.
                But so mustn't we forget, that the world is farther than this; and as we ought be a certain way as not
                to be
                whithered by its erosion, and that in sobriety and thoughtfullness ought our time with such fortunes
                make
                such a must, that beyond such dear fortunes lie the candor and hues of the world, to which we ought be
                equally amnple in our ways to see it.

                So my dependance on my parents is more cirucmstance than any thing worth contempt. I have been on my
                own,
                and in that scenario, our state and aim in life was rightly just. At least, remarks about it held no
                swathing disdain as per our dependance.
                <br>&emsp;And as for our current place as such, so were we asked.
                <br>&emsp;As regards family, I see it as unneccessary, strictly that is. That, and the time and state in
                which you form it, is not an obvious thing either; for one could choose to do so early or later in life;
                and
                so could it be much later --considering the abiulity to adopt. And its no small point to see that in our
                propiety, that generoisity is already so abundant, that the concentraed peak of a child is not eseential
                for
                fulfillment. A partner is otherwise someone you have, as is the case for comrades and friends. But a
                child
                may not be neccessary in terms of the requirment in it. That, or your contribution may be more civil
                then
                private. "For one can not raise a child, deeply, and also manage a nation. At least, time, oblige and
                effort
                are required on both ends; and it seems unfair to the child especially to rear it with your hand half
                way in
                another jar."
                <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I am in this becoming state, whereby my place in the world or role in a family
                is
                per my actual self: for that is where my efforts are given from. In that, by some fidelity to a honored
                spot, ought you be more than capable in your means to give. And the first rule of that is in focus, in
                that
                you don't reach for things in order to serve the moment; rather to submitt yourself to them and all they
                need. In the way that you'd risk your life for the child, so is it the same in your effort and time
                across
                their development, that such attention would be sacrified for that. And ought you have the means and
                commitment to that.
                <br>&emsp;I find the notion of possibility a dreary one, for the proper regard for it is surely
                undefintivitve. My words, as proper, are not always shared or welcome by others, who seek things now.
                Nore
                is my reproach from things due to our candicay being premature something which is often praised or
                heard.
                Moreso, in our general scope of life -and such regards- we may find much work to be done personally, and
                inline with that, interests which were drawn to from such composure. This then, is not merely a question
                of
                orientation to a common subject, but a disregard for such object for the purpose of another.
                <br>&emsp;In that way I find myself feeling disgraceful, as if our means to family is wrong, or too
                little
                emphasized ---as family being a goal in itself.
                <br>&emsp;It should be noted that responsibility towards what is otherwise possible, as if we should
                work to
                make something happen, is not to do with happiness, but duty; which seems to be drawn from some broader
                moral principle.
                <br>&emsp;In that sense, as the economy is a different mode of the otherwise social cooperation for
                sustenece, so is the idea of 'family' as a crux of society a somewhat ancient notion: pre economic if
                you
                will.

                So the background for lifes conduct comes down to the vector of possibility, and the all to likely
                change,
                and that of the material known to us, and what we can expect.
                <br>&emsp;In that sense, we may view something as sure and defined, or otherwise admitt the natural
                development we go through by simply experiencing things, learning then applying. That, and the world may
                change, in the ease in which your desires are met, and in how simple it is to handle oppertunites --be
                it
                old or new.
                <br>&emsp;So will fortune accrue though, be it to your aid or not. And by that, it is not unessential
                that
                we regard the econmoical risks of what may come our way. But in life, there are definite ends, and sure
                ones
                at that. Ones, which in contrast to money, require the dedication to ourselves, as to prepare and
                grapple
                with such events. Whereas money leads one to apply themselves for the sake of such means, whereby the
                need
                for purchasing has a built supply, so lies the debts of illness, injury, death and loss.
                <br>&emsp;And indeed, the common interest in eye care and dental, along with the general and or special
                care
                in terms of medicine and first aid, are all acceptable as desired things, neccessary even. But our
                future
                need not prepare for the purchase of a boat, or a car thats more than sufficient. Nor should we plan on
                trips, ventures, projects and or whims, that are based on absent understanding of what the world means.
                <br>&emsp;For in that, I cannot entirely say; nor do I mean to suggest it. But we can say, generally,
                that
                being so considerate of nature and your place in it, removes one from interests which spring themselves
                from
                the absence of such thoughts. I concede to the benefit and or need for basic things beyond that of
                shelter
                and food. But not much is worth but less.
                <br>&emsp;In this way the conduct of life is a struggle to dispense. For all my personal experiences
                mean
                not, if they are not pointed towards some true end. In that lies the conflict of liberty and activism,
                abstract versus concrete thought, reason at the cost of lethargy and contempt. And at any rate, all we
                have
                outside such truths, is a limitless address of the things we've known so far; which we can comment on at
                least. For I may not know this or that, but I can at least be commiserate to the path were on, and at
                that
                be aware of the terrain and our state; for we ought see where were going, what is not had which is
                needed;
                but so may we also rest on the things we do have, and how the experience has been thus far, settling
                into
                the troubles ahead as being not but hurdles for our legs to cross, or points of trouble which require
                the
                patience and fortuity that our time has already shown to have.

                In our current state, we are unsure of the future; and rightly so. But our ability to be thus present is
                not
                entirely so, for in near exactness, our bodies tissue is unable to rest; and at that, we can only move
                or do
                nothing.
                <br>&emsp;Consequently, we are in a mix of haste and or idleness, showered ahead by what we do not know.
                That is part of it though, in that the cause of such haze is circumstantial. And our proper course is

                A basic thnig is off about me. Namely, our muscle tone is all to stiff, and at that only able to remain
                so,
                or relax; but it cannot settle, all whilst being firm, taught and ample, but in that not overly soft and
                baseless, nor too cemented or brazen.
                <br>&emsp;Practically, one's time on a couch or bed will relax the muscles; or better put, one's muscles
                will relax in order to be in such position. Similarly, a chair will draw some relaxtion, but rigidity
                too.
                Being on the floor however, or crosslegged, bares the most rigidity into the body. Yet, the fact is that
                the
                posture allows for deep breathing, which lightens the structure, and permitts the muscles to be brim.
                <br>&emsp;If one has too much sugar, or works out too little, then the muscles become restless, and
                neither
                invite or can take in as much oxygen, leaving them flat or stiff. This gives one a constant need for
                motion,
                as the alternative being off is not desired. Haste though, a feeling of worn, and a whithering effect
                occur.
                <br>&emsp;Particularly is this so when you are on the floor; as the natural stature of the pose requires
                more in order to be upright; the failure of which holds it's own consequence; but, otherwise bears down
                on
                one's ability to remain upright. There's this experience of falling into your core, as it has no breadth
                or
                strenght. Everything thus evens itself out for the sake of neccessity, as oppose to a whole composure
                sinking in and amongst itself. This leads to poor breathing, which causes the ware on the muscles.
                <br>&emsp;The question then is what should one do if there in the middle of such state. For they may be
                to

                So our eating is fine, yet unclear to me. At least, our grip on it seems untight.
                <br>&emsp;A promising note though, is that roughage in the morning, starting with pure roughage, into
                energy
                and perhaps capped with some more leniant kinds of pure roughahge, followed by a period of grain; which
                in
                all honesty, seems sufficient at three servings. At least, if your wondering what your going to have,
                think
                if you have popcorn, bread, potatoes or seed, and your fine.
                <br>&emsp;Exercise wise, our muscles seem to be restoring themselve; by which we can live easier, and
                exercise more.
                <br>&emsp;The core of our being is in the up and down session; beginning in mountain, folding to childs
                pose, upping to down dog and back to mountain, then (with wide legged fold perhaps) back down to figure
                eight. This brings selinity to the day.
                <br>&emsp;I will not mention further function, as these are near natural, and at that, unclear by our
                struggle in doing so. We'll let it be then.
                <br>&emsp;As regards life, I have fair grounds to the stretch ahead, along with fair sense of the truth
                which guides me.
                <br>&emsp;Our own negative lies in the insolidity of our entire place. For mom and dad are great, but
                hold
                little to me more than what appears functional. Our reason thus feels trapped when it is our emphasis;
                which
                in its own right builds madness and resent.
                <br>&emsp;At any rate though, I see how our broader ways, as guilded by the eras prior, is more or less
                fine; and all to grasped by our less than sure coming state. This is fine however, as we need only
                recover,
                as to more comofrtably sit and set such time ahead. From which, the future will seem fine, and we will
                at
                peace on approach; which, in itself, will procure more harmony and base to what lies far and around.

                Right now, our base level is firm, yet a bit light. It reaches, or ebbs to it sometimes, in that tender
                zone. From here, our sight and gait reach forever high, to the cieling at least. But, so much as we are
                below that tender point, so does such stair become undense.
                <br>&emsp;In contrast, if our time was more firm, or excess rather than that tender spot, then we may
                still
                see high, but densely.
                <br>&emsp;In that, the two modes can be compared in terms of height reached, or ends rather, and their
                density. In that, being at home tends to be less dense despite being high, as the base beneat is
                lighter.
                While working tends to be less high and more dense, because the base is harder.

                My first jobs were techincially coaching and refing. The latter was stressfull, the former fufilling. My
                first real job was at Boston Pizza. From there I worked as a detailer, followed longer by a car washer;
                then
                as a delivery driver, sandpitt cleaner at Eagle Ridge, house painter, and a sushi maker at Save on
                Foods. In
                2017 I left save on to work at Walmart as a produce associate; I did so for a year. I was hired for
                personal
                shopping near the end of 2019, and left October the following year. When I moved to Vancouver in 2022, I
                was
                rehired as personal shopper in August, and left early November in order to be with my Dad.
                <br>&emsp;Now, we are moving back, and surely for any and all reasons. We have too little money to move
                out,
                get hired, make an income, and bridge ourselves till the constancy of it is in place. Our mom and dad
                have
                not sold their home, and are taking on the mortage of a new one; and as it happens, including a month or
                two
                for completion, our current house may not sell till April, May or June even. It could be earlier, as Amy
                remarked that buyers wait to see which direction interests are going; she also mentioned that buyers may
                come at any time, late even. Our dad even said that the folks who wished to buy our house had some
                interest
                following their long drout of nothing. So it may sell; and surely, if we take it off before the years
                done,
                and put it back up soon into the new year, then it may sell then.
                <br>&emsp;We are being told to work though, if only because any of our living expenses cannot be
                covered.
                The problem, is that if I get a job, accustomed and settled, then the course of doing this again is but
                another beginning.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, I have no modern grounds to sit on. For sure, many people succeed in the current
                age;
                but I am not convinced there happy; especially at least.
                <br>&emsp;What I see, is that the times of old, and the ways born of them, hold no basis any more. The
                behaviour of people hasn't changed, only the value. But so in living, as it is fashioned to this day, so
                do
                people work for that as they would in the past.
                <br>&emsp;And I have no immediate answer as to what I am doing different. Nor is it easy to be so
                forthcoming, and not get sucked into doubt, as to our current place and whether or not our prior actions
                were misplaced amidst the proper course of action: one, which it is not clear why the common route is
                not
                such.
                <br>&emsp;What brings it up for me is a sort of youthfull interest, and the balance of the world's need,
                and
                one's optimism that they can make their dreams come true according to that. Whereas a child who has no
                duty
                can openly see the world, youth are asked things, and at that, driven to see things in terms of duty and
                taste per the broader world. One, mind you, which is detailed with the tenants of family and social
                value.
                Whike a kids broad view is one of mere wonder. At least in their case, the extent of their view holds no
                boundires or commisioned regard; while youth, however open as per their reltaivley younger ways, has
                more
                formality and concern lined in their vision. "Which is why children, seeing not but the stars, dream of
                reachinbg them; while youth think of their time and place with respect to ability, means, finance,
                ends."
                <br>&emsp;It might be an aid to submitt the basis of our duty and aim, which is along lines of family
                value.
                For nothing else holds so dear a spot as the basis for our kind. We may have worked together in
                different
                ways, and for different ends; but so as time and stability gained, was the constant of procreation and
                according relations bade.
                <br>&emsp;With that in mind, and pairing the notion of modernity, the real question, by which our
                uncertainty rests, is of the manner in which our liberty should persits, with such family in mind. For
                on
                one end, there is the matter of one's natural proclivity to procreate, and the balance between electing
                to
                do so and the counterweight (of not doing so as early as possible) by those who happen to do so. In
                that,
                there is a lop sided statistic, which rightly suggests that, by our natural proclivity, that procreation
                will happen with either earnestness or happen chance via our natural bent. This is not an ideal, but an
                appeal to the populace need for procreation; and the stastical strenght in seeing this as likely by the
                common natures of folk -who are, and continue to be.

                My roots are not so straightforward, but by whichever course, I came to see something good.
                <br>&emsp;This came from a sense of propiety, which beyond the true beginning, had a earlier bout in
                similarly tough times.
                <br>&emsp;Because of this, my life has been a religous sort, in that our experience held the scale, or
                measure rather in which things were weighed against: whether that be as supportive, negativite, or, per
                the
                norms, relevant or not.
                <br>&emsp;That latter notion fairs the trick. For I may, in all liberty, choose to consume and practice
                what
                I please. But that I would make money, and the means for it at that, marks something a little different.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the transition between adolescence and youth was one of a idle conception, whereby
                the
                care for our experience cuold not be priortized at the abandonment of success. That is, our needs were
                not
                able to be satisfied without some sort of amends. "Literally, I sought to sleep outside."
                <br>&emsp;As it stands, I understand this now, but am also pressed by loose thinking. For our experience
                is
                all I care about. Nor are those needs and their means a damning hault. That, and our agreement to such
                means
                and the contentment to such ends, is not one which takes away from our experience. Beyond the passion
                which
                our oblige excites, and the coloring of our experience in such a dreamt way, so does the stability and
                space
                affored by our place in life, both prompt and service our experience, and at that delight it. For such
                occupations, however civil, are part of our experience, and at that afford us different textures and
                sight.
                Moreso, as our recent days have shown, that such a commisery, of mere stabilyt and experience, has no
                need
                or trajectory of stationlessness or promise. For we may apply ourselves, find goods beyond ourself in
                romance or friends; and at that, per our fuller wants, and complimentary needs --within such a life-- we
                can
                invovle ourselves in recreation or public affairs; be that churhc, free yoga, drop in sports and
                community
                involvment.

                When I start with our experience in mind, I hukbly oblige the missing holes of our knowledge; not at all
                out
                of respect, for why would truth need any, but as a remark of what may in fact be wise for us to concern.
                <br>&emsp;For the complexion of such experience may not define the broader structure of it; and at that,
                per
                one's intent to oblige, may our current amends be less fair in the future than they are now. As we
                mentioned, there was a point in 2018 where we thought that our duties were stearing us away from our
                experience, or piking it into the ground at least, by which we sought to ascend. But in seeing that we
                could
                not, so doth our adulthood lay. My point though, is that when we mark our experience as the aim of our
                regard, that so are broader interests or needs beyond the present worth addressing, as to fairly enstate
                ourselves within our current action. For most advice is based on the future and what your current
                actions
                are oppertune to treat -or prepare rather. And it is one thing to say that the present is fine via
                simplicity; but of the future and what we are more or less fine to consider, that so does the common
                view of
                the present hold an equal norm in the future. OUr present care and grasp of the present absolves
                according
                cocnerns or guidance (for some other aim); but so lingers the norms of the future.
                <br>&emsp;This creates an all mighty reservation. For less we remove ourselves from the matters central
                to
                such future, or we let such future come to be, and happily via our simple (and forseen as such) conduct,
                then we are left with a sort of ignorant and or defiant relation to what is ahead. Most folk, and
                tradition
                on the whole, stands from such a view, that of what is to come, that the past has already been privy to
                such; of which those so indetted offered their history with such.
                <br>&emsp;We could bring it together like this. Experience is a matter of quality, in that your time, be
                it
                from within, or by its relation to some task, is both sturdy and secure, but rich and tender too. As it
                were
                though, the promotion of such is not something, despite the core means, which can be mitigated entirely
                by
                such means; for as means, they need a person to exhibit them, and at that be alive; for which our needs
                our
                measured by [our ability to meet such standard and exhibit ourselves]. And the take away is that as
                measure
                is more or less based upon home and food, that so in natural and moral need, do the matters of family
                and
                community lay.

                I've heard politics regarded as childish, and media as garbage; yet those some folk are curious, and at
                that
                elated at the means for knowledge.
                <br>&emsp;For starters, being unsure and holding steady within such uncertainty is much preferred then
                to
                evaluate the world on by those sources; by your own admission their poor. But in this, lies the need for
                reproach, as one must deliberately examine the world, through writing, inquiry and purer sources; and as
                such, must sit in reproach, before fuller opinions are made.
                <br>&emsp;We make for our experience though, and by that, when the words of politics and publicists are
                being told, and friends, family or communal sentiment is in response, so do we sit on our own
                examinations;
                by their virute, and their contrast to those scattered words.
                <br>&emsp;In this though lies some vulnerability, for seeing those frustrated, opinioned or unnerved
                about
                the world leaves an idealistic scent in air, as if it is our role to attend to such troubles, and at
                that
                not be so ignorant as to not be so. By this, I can permitt so form of generosity, be it active or in
                virute;
                one being a invovlment in such affairs, the other being a behavior of agreeableness, as to consent and
                assimilate to changes made for the broader good. "This will help," you hear, and you thus situate
                yourself
                to that for the common good.
                <br>&emsp;There is a tricky aspect though, namely our rebellious mind, or that of removing hurdles and
                power; which differs then educating folks or protest, or that of submission; but rather evokes a sort of
                defiant removal, as to not merely improve, or yield to imrpovement, but to tear down those responsible.
                <br>&emsp;I am not so agreeing to this aspect of fighting. For one, my sense of it is incomplete; while
                the
                other, is that our view of the world is an examined one; and due to the size of the world, in both time
                and
                breadth, we more often than not sit in a state of consideration, rather than approach. I admitt that
                this is
                but the present, and our idea at least of how active we should be -and in the ways we can- is
                progressing.
                But I don't much admitt the 'less than examined' -in reality or as seemd- conceptions of the world. No
                one
                is forcing us to work in camps, or removing our right to speech, assembly, guns even. All there is
                really,
                is a world whos antiquated roots has born conflict, despite the collective harmony of the broader
                powers.
                And at that, lies econony, or the vectors for people to recieve and exhibit liberty. By this, sits
                interest
                rates for mortage and loans, and the lever of taxes (for various groups). One's professional conduct is
                one
                thing, but ought our fears of this not be so condensed; nor ought we confuse a specific scenario with
                that
                of the broader world. The United States is not going to war with Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy, Africa,
                Australia, India or France. They could war with Russia or China; but the merrits of that which rest on
                specualtion, and of a far sort, seem like sparks on an otherwise dense world. Moreso, ought our fear of
                that, be mature when it comes to the projected loss; and unceded to ignorance as regards nuclear

                So my time in the recent era has been one of vagrancy. At least, I resort to such when a stationary life
                feels to slow and small. The path in this, to be clear, is not one of much variety, as our temporary
                stay
                always amounts to staying with family.
                <br>&emsp;I do so though with no future in mind, and their allowance. But as of late, I've felt that our
                taste of such vagrancy, paired mind you with our family prescence, is not either sought or ideal.
                <br>&emsp;Normally the thinking is that, if our experience is key, then removing accessory
                responsability
                will furnish our means and enjoment of that. As it were though, the limitations of doing so on our own
                are
                no longer there, nor are the concessions of being near family as permitted.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the hope of mine has been to turn our love into dreams, whereby the care to do so
                was
                furnished by some encumbent substance. "Like my fancies were made into something beyond themselves, as
                to
                support them." Besides the drama in doing so, the real issue was that, as the future was brought to
                mind, or
                the matter of our satiety, so did I clinch at the thought of being so still and stable, yet small in our
                experience. That is, our means were never that far, and by that, offered not much more than the mere
                means
                to be; yet such being was halted, or at least sequestered via the bounds of such means. "Like a I
                couldn't
                see or dream naturally, as our future held nothing but the mundanity of our means."
                <br>&emsp;What changed is that our idea of what experience requires, and the dissolving of outward
                limitations, made it so the common sway of our means was not so limiting. Not only in space, but motion,
                as
                per possibility, means of acquaintence, and normal paths for community. And because of this, our
                privation
                for the sake of experience was held with less reverence. For despite the freedom to truly be, there
                lacked
                much substance; and at that, only forced me to be even more, as to make do with less substance. "Like I
                were
                squiting my eye in order to see more around me."
                <br>&emsp;Now, as it stands, that need to squint is no longer sought; and such a feeling is elevated by
                the
                consenting sight of stable means, which remove such need to squint, and through their lack of
                restrictivness; which, in itself, was something I experienced in terms of having a rich time, without so
                much interference from things once sought damning. By yielding to the common rungs of the world, there
                is
                immediatley more possibility. And at that, our feeling of ware upon our squint, is given room and reason
                to
                end; as there lies a suitble, promising and lively place outside dependancy.

                For simplicity, one might divide their life into work, family and personal values. The first remarks
                your
                care in terms of means; children, amidst other relations mark the second, while the qualities and or
                interests dear to your experience, mark the latter.
                <br>&emsp;Someone's experience may offer insight to how any of these ought to be; or, considering values
                are
                like aims, may guidance or service be given towards such fruition. But it is insurmountably paramount
                that
                advice given is appropriate to the value at hand. For a doctor may offer me insight as to how to become
                one,
                not that I should be one. Then even, if they offered some sense of work values which being a doctor
                harmonizes with, so doth my personal and family value lay.

                For starters, the front of our training, where were doing well that is, can be characterzied by things
                I'd
                be worse off in not doing; and so forth within a bad state, that there are things I'd be poor not to do.
                <br>&emsp;In this way, broader motions such as downward dog (as to lengthen) and core strengtheners such
                as
                leg raise or bridge mark that front position; while merely bringing yourself back to an aerobic quality
                marks the resolve within a depleted state. For strenght nor stabiulity can be rightly attempted when the
                body is weary and thin.
                <br>&emsp;In other news, our mom and dad have lessened a little in their imperative that I get a job.
                There
                is the matter of moving, and the ability we have by our own means. It seems we will not be spending our
                cash
                in any large degree. Time will go on though; and the matter of giving me some cash in order to buffer
                the
                move, is not an immediate threat. Time will go on, and so may that mean be lessened. But the
                understanding
                we have ought iron ought; particulary when the preferred move becomes solidiefe as the only option; and
                at
                that, our need to help with the final move and what not, will bring our future in line to what we seek.
                Right now, there is too much work to be done; and so trying to solidify that future state is improbable.
                So
                we'll let it happen; and at any rate, orient our actions as to be properly placed. For I may ultiatmely
                go
                back to Pitt and stay there through the bloom. This does have some benefit and secure means of
                transition.
                That, and it is more than welcomed by our mom and dad. But our otherwise ideal of going to Vancouver and
                settling there may become more open as the busy work is done.

                I have some loose thoughts, but some no less. Centering primarily on the balance between public and
                private
                discource.
                <br>&emsp;As I see it, there's this (albeit fair) tendency to attribute media production as a sort of
                linch
                on the corportions and governments of the world. "Like those speaking are rallying up the citizens, who
                then
                rally to make demands; and the governmetns all sweating, tossing here and fro in order to amend."
                <br>&emsp;But our rational view does not portray this; even though our experience, in brief even, of
                media
                is otherwise concluding.
                <br>&emsp;In part, the issue lies in the orientation of our regards, whereby the press is in one sense
                deemed a constituent of the public, similar to the way that governments are in an administrative sense.
                But
                it is important to know, that the press is not an essential feature of a system, as the management of
                state
                affairs are seldom done in referendum or disclosure. Indeed those enacting such affairs are chosen, and
                by
                that representatives; but in lew of old comparisons, the sentiment is one of trust and the extent to
                which
                it can be given; and so much as it cannot, so lies the press' purpose.
                <br>&emsp;This is all fair and good. The issue comes in when our understanding of the state (and its
                features) runs short, and the seeming presence of the media becomes one of contrast to such state. As
                our
                emotions regarding the govenrment -short of virtue and patriotism- are negativie. That is, they are akin
                to
                one's care for a parent, in that they love them, but dislike them, as the sense of discipline is always
                on
                the line. While one's relationship with the media is generally positive; for they never ask, but show
                where
                your authorities are mistaken. They may even say their wrong. "As one's reprieve from their parents is
                not
                so much a dismissal and or rebuke, but frustration. In youth, one tends to rebel, namely by their
                developed
                posutre and sense." And it is a lapse of knowledge on my part which leaves the media as seeming to
                conjure
                such confidence in the public.
                <br>&emsp;And the consequence is not one of actual disruption, but sentiment. "No matter the woes andc
                cries
                of folk, Wall Street keeps running, money keeps talking, and officials conduct their adminstrative and
                civil
                affairs." The trouble, is that as one who is both ignorant and sensible, I wish to either learn, and at
                that
                suspend my judgements until having and understanding; or I sit with the impressions of the world
                steadily,
                remarking upon their minor effects within the breadth and time of our state. But when people are
                complaining, or you get the sense that they are, then you feel like your 'less than critical and or
                indifferent' view of things is unacceptable. This is fine, and per the norm, a fair condition to have.
                But
                our ignorance acts as a hole in which our composure escapes. For instance, if there is a perceived
                sentiment
                of an officials licentiousness, then our ignornace of how officials are impactful will leave me somewhat
                unable to rest on the irrelevane of said persons behavior; for such grievence is not a true remark of
                their
                civil effect. Indeed there is room for such grievence, but per the points to do with such behavior. And
                the
                common effect, by me at least, is that with such an vicious stain, that such offical is seen as
                incapable,
                or better yet an antagonist within their civil action. And I, having some sense, know that the behaviour
                in
                question does not mean, in all likelihood, or in relevance, that their civil efficacy is off. A matter
                of
                ethics sure; but that the both would and could turn the lever is not essentially diminished by their
                licentiousness. If I don't know about such civil action though, generally I'd say, then I have a hard
                time
                resting on such notion. For, in all fairness, I seldom feel so anarchic or afraid as public sentiment
                can
                seem. But in appearing so, I am only more pushed to be steady in our own sensible view. Indeed our life
                can
                procurre such indifference by its own motions and 'ingestion' of media. But so much as I do view it, and
                have this farce reaction, so do our definitions lie. And if they are empty or loose, then I am left
                standing
                with the sense that nothing is wrong, but not then able to say why things are all right. "The public is
                afraid, or acting against some malignancy which I do not see. But I do not knwo what there is otherwise.
                As
                if someone said that God created the world, and that such a claim was so by neccessity; and I may say
                sure,
                in admittence, but that such a claim was empty. Or better yet, that I did not align with such view
                naturally, but had no other which I did. " Such struggle we'd define and say, is about a subjection to
                falsity, or claims at least which are not whole, principled (and at that from inquiry, and thus
                suggestive),
                but then not having something of your own which is defined. For you end up refuting such claims on their
                baseless, rather than denying them on some truer measure.
                <br>&emsp;In that though, lies one who heeds no rush to finish their quilt; or at that lacks any taste
                or
                happiness for their effort. But when someone comes in and rattles the piece so far, it fairs both petty
                grievence and more serious aversion as to the welcomenedness of rough action upon a working piece.

                When I was younger, I cared most about being myself. Being so young, I had no alternative sense. But,
                compared to fire, scenarios which seemed to draw me out of that state were more or less hot, and an
                aversion.
                <br>&emsp;When I got older, circumstances came about whereby we'd recieve the means to further
                ourselves,
                and I'd say no. And upon reflection, a core reason was that, without indisputable amounts of cash, that
                your
                realization of those ways would fall short; we saw awkwardness in the scenario, and a fairly reproached
                place from our parents serving us in that full way. For if we worked to make this form of life happened,
                then I would be alright and unembarressed. But as it were, when I was young even, the means for me to do
                so
                were not there or apparent; and having to ask our mom and dad felt like gathering lingering sticks to
                make a
                fire; the flame of which, by that method, felt unstable. And from that doubt, led to a fear of change,
                as if
                I would become someone different, but in a state of want of such things.
                <br>&emsp;Instead, I choose to do nothing, and remain by myself. I never lacked friends and ability; but
                so
                as they amended themsevles for women and fun, I was left alone. Better yet, I transitioned into caring
                for
                those things primarily, but was in a rather minnowed state in terms of means. I became a sort of tag
                along,
                hitching off of other peoples car and booze.
                <br>&emsp;As I got older though, this way of living led to despair. I recall one point where I was fully
                working, and had unparamount means to splurge; and doing so truly felt rewarding. But as that situation
                eroded, and our means became smaller and challenging, so did I care little but for a indulgence which
                was
                binge worthy. Prior, we'd drive around, have fun and be a light. While in this, I wished only to be
                alone,
                or a mile away from a party, and consume things for satiety rather than fun.
                <br>&emsp;The balance seemed to be the thing which was off. For our full amends brought with it a sort
                of
                confidence; the opposite of which brought embarassment and doubt, as if I merely thought of fun, but
                relied
                on others to provide it for me.
                <br>&emsp;This is one end of things. And indeed, our full time at work and the full means of fun around
                it,
                marked what is the otherwise path of teenage fufillment. And by that, what I failed to reach the years
                prior. But as the work slipped, so did the fun; and by that, what we sought changed to. We became
                private in
                our interests; and despite the substance remaining, our care for it became less outward and exuberent,
                but
                personal, in the way I cared about games and noraml food. "Smoking weed became a sort of inhaler, of
                which I
                had no interest in doing it in some elaborate way; and even though this would occure, as smoking was so
                desired, I much preferred to be in a comfier sitatution while doing it."
                <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, this mode of life did not continue. Namely because the use of weed was
                depleting, and our shorter means around were noticbly small. When I went to college though, I found that
                or
                aim of it was bare. And despite enjoying the tasks, the purpose of them was empty. And so the reality of
                applying ourself had so little to contirubte, beyond our natural interest, that we became depressed; as
                it
                was like wishing to leave a post, in intent at least -for I did not mind showing up.
                <br>&emsp;Following this, we were exposed to the brevity of nutrition, noticing through some article
                that
                mussels had 12000 vitamin B12, and Kale with 1000 vitamin K. Me and my friend were so intrigued, as if a sort of richness was in
                front of us. Unfortunatley though,
                despite gaining much personally, we focused so much on turning such interests into something profitable. Only,
                our care
                for such things lied so deep and at hand, that the seperation from the outer world which spurred us to see such
                things,
                held no place for us to bring such things into fruition.
                <br>&emsp;As it were, the desire to be in that outer world is one best characterized by security and fun, and
                unweildingly as not to be impassioned but elated -like were seeking more than ingrained. But as said, we were
                not in
                such lands, or much in line with them. Being was not clear or easy otherwise, which was why, as is sometimes
                portrayed
                in peoples conversion to religion, that doing things central to ourselves was itself a sort of application. In a
                similar
                way, upon breaking up with our girlfriend and loosing friends, we stirnly applied ourselves to schooling, and
                took up a
                consistent workout regime. And of note, when we ended up changing schools and finding more friends, our
                outwardly place
                became more secure, and our personal interest wained.
                <br>&emsp;At any rate, we did not create that buisness, as we only had excitment for such things, but held no
                definite
                means or care to bring them beyond ourselves. The point I'm getting at, is that our wish to do so was one akin
                to being
                offered money, and the elation which comes with that. In getting older, I can see that a steady and secure place
                within
                yourself removes the otherwise outward interest, or sensitivity rather, by which forward or deep means to such
                fruition
                are attached to.

                    So I have some lust, and perhaps rightly so. I see craiglist personals, eharmony like sites, POF
                    like sites,
                    and other things of the sort. At the very least we can pursue something, or be invovled, and at
                    that, have
                    some sort of priority beyond ourself; which I believe will help in being more discrete at work and
                    recreation.
                    <br>&emsp;This pleausre though is consuming, and I see nothing else. And oddly, besides our
                    experience, I
                    cannot quite explain why this is not the soul aim. For the reason to do it is paramount, like warmth
                    in the
                    cold.
                    <br>&emsp;Yet our days have only shown, by neccessity maybe, how being steady within yourself is not
                    only
                    satisfying, but reassuring to any of the desires who abscence sprung us to be more self content;
                    and, we are
                    quite fufilled with such development, for nothing feels better than working on yourself. That, and
                    we don't
                    feel idle so long as we have this aim; for there is never so much you can do, nor any time to stop
                    it.
                    <br>&emsp;But the true promise of this is liberty. For one who needs the world will not have much
                    luck less
                    fortune bears the way. And even if they held the kingdom's crown, so would it not feel enough. While
                    Cretes
                    walked around happily in a theadborn robe; or Socrates, who responding to Melinulus' claim that
                    Athens was
                    expensive, showed him that barley was a minced amount compared to the olives and wine which he
                    sought, and
                    at that measured expenses by.
                    <br>&emsp;In all manners, the fruit of glory, gluttons and loins, is but a inflammed moment, heated,
                    somewhat impassioned; but the moment goes like each point of a stream; leading one to become
                    somewhat
                    disposed, and angled towards another moment. While self regard and content, by it's own merrit,
                    seeps one
                    into a state of rest and tranquility; something of which is, in practice, lost only by contrary
                    efforts or a
                    lapse of producing ones; nor do the effects of such balanace loose their appeal upon use, both in
                    reliability of the means, and their saturation. "For as I paint my pallete with sweets and wine, so
                    does the
                    same taste mundane. While the crsip feeling of a steady morn, looses none of its endearment or
                    appeal; nor
                    do the means to such freshness loose their stature as being so productive, and at that value and
                    appointment."
                    <br>&emsp;All in all, liberty is our claim from being propietous. For the world may grant fortune;
                    but not
                    even death is excluded from the emperor's call. And at that, I am not sure what remarks we have
                    about wishes
                    and ends that don't fall beneath that?
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, liberty is what occurs when one is free enough to live well; in that, the
                    latter
                    notion marks a cease of hostility; while the former marks a sentiment of fertility and faciliation.
                    For
                    none, in the freest state, can inherently paint, or reconigze the details of wonder; or at that,
                    find a sort
                    of peace and steadyness found by right actions. For the matters which give them leave to such
                    pursuit, do
                    not imbide them with the qualities they seek. As a removal of famine, and at that an offer of
                    plentiful
                    food, does not inscribe the proper use of that. Being fed versus not is a matter of freedom, for the
                    brightest star could not pull you away from starvation. But upon satiety, or the ability to do so,
                    the
                    actual amends for liberty, or reasonable goods, come to pass. For it is not only a state which needs
                    moderation; in that food was on offer and you needed to select 'wholer' kinds. For even if whole
                    kinds were
                    all that was available, this still would neither A) account for other choices which held moderate
                    means, and
                    B) actions which were not only good because they were not something altenrativley bad, but actual
                    productive. In that way, positive amends are what liberty feeds off of. For in despair, one cannot
                    even
                    survive; and are at best lucky to breathe. But upon such breathe, they may attempt to overcumb such
                    need.
                    Upon doing so though, beyond being free, there are accomodations within the matters of such need
                    --such as
                    keeping to foods rather than indulgent ones-- along with efforts which produce the stations for
                    richer
                    goods. As painting is not embellished by a mere steady hand, but a practiced one. Even the sights
                    which
                    spurr you to the page, can be seen in a finer light. For one's interest in representing death, no
                    matter the
                    heart, no matter the trade, still require an understanding of what it is; at least, in their attempt
                    to
                    further see it through their craft, ought they reflect on the parts they already know. "For there is
                    surely
                    some characterizing feature which makes it distinct from life: but in that, ought one delicately
                    know."
                    <br>&emsp;In that, one in need cares not for the goods of consumption or liberty, but the filling of
                    their
                    stomach. Upon such satiety, they may be prepped for richer kinds of satiety, and at that, the
                    exhibition of
                    wants which spiral off from the deeper needs. But in the land of reason, lies a fuller kind of
                    being, namely
                    that of expression and receptivity. For the vanity of consumption is not all to hard to detail; but
                    we can
                    say, in comparison, that it is not so delightful by the abscent terms which expression and
                    receptivity
                    offer. In those, your in motion like consumption; only one is falling over, seeing only what is
                    exciting
                    their passion, and more than not likely unable to be much more upon completion. While the other is
                    light and
                    tender; and albeit not so heated and alloyed, so is the initial step one of dear fancy, rising up to
                    a
                    fairer mark in terms of substance, but like the ends of a storm still winding away. The fruits of
                    our loin
                    come to pass, leaving us to seek more; while one in the purer kinds of motion, be it of dance, words
                    or
                    craft, tend to remain so, ably and happily. Moreover, the dearest part of this, for those at least
                    who have
                    lust the youtfull means or interest in such lust, is that through and upon such tender attentions,
                    one is
                    treated to the all mighty posture of rest; whereby the effect is not one of past pleasure and more
                    to come,
                    but a satsifcation which lets one peacefully be: as if they'd truly one. For in that, the tips and
                    tats of
                    our writing and craft pitter along, picking up to their own fuller strides; but so in our heart and
                    mind do
                    we settle, gently, but whole and solidly too. And be it the cooling wind, or the heat of a summer
                    day, so
                    does the fuller grooves of your craft wear little upon a lack of means or time; for the strides
                    prior have
                    given you the strenght from what you'd already done. "While those moves to cheese, sex, fame and
                    wine, care
                    only for more; or worse, sit uneasily if there's none."

                    In all fairness, meeting your lusting needs is no small task. If it were so simple, then the
                    comparison
                    between expression and receptivity would be one of quality; at least qualities of taste and
                    consistency,
                    over accesibility.
                    <br>&emsp;But the truth of the matter is that having sex, eating rich food, purchasing wonderful
                    things, is
                    no small cost. Or, better yet, that compared to expression, which bears satiety in even failed
                    attempts, the
                    route to such consumptions are not so definite; rather you must try and chase, and deal with the
                    unease
                    until such excess.
                    <br>&emsp;For I see that consumption is like a splinter, throbbing till its dislodged. And in that
                    way, I
                    say nothing ill of sex or food, but gluttony, distaste for whole things, and horniness. For these
                    things
                    cloud your mind and spirit, rustling you till their goal is finished. And indeed there is room for
                    excitment, along with pleasure, but it ought not thwart the rest of your life.
                    <br>&emsp;The reality though is that sex is hard to come by. At least, in our younger years, we were
                    somewhat embarrassed by the natural means we had, and not those which bore sparkle to your
                    attraction. In
                    many ways I saw the means to such sparkle as futile and dumb; and thus we steared away from their
                    ends
                    completely. In good sense, the right statement is one that says, by your natural goods, that you
                    offer them
                    without comparative pretense and shame, or at that, exagerated needs which such 'pretenses' are
                    based on.
                    "For the vain idea of beauty, in hotness namely, does expect more than those natural needs. Yet all
                    people
                    have beauty, and at that, hold room for attracion. And the relations born of this need less than
                    those
                    grandeur displays."
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed our life can be summed up by a balance of cynic complacency, fair reprieve from
                    superflous
                    and taughty showmanship, along with a sort of crushed despair between the ultimate bounds of which
                    our 'hot
                    interests' were moderated by, and the otherwise expression of that range of cynicism into the
                    dislike and
                    disinterest in working for such consumptions, but in a moderate lane.
                    <br>&emsp;For our mom and dad never let the future and our current prepeartive duties slip away. And
                    by
                    that, all I saw was a life employed towards that. And such a life was not one I yearned for. And so,
                    the
                    youthfull efforts which would serve my hotter interests, were not embellished due to our sense of
                    duty being
                    reproached from; as such a sense was marshalled agasint the broader parts of our life: and our
                    swerve from
                    those saw me swerve from those which were more novel and fruitfully fun.

                    Coming from this is an over reliance on liberal goods. For our aversion to the norms, and at that an
                    unremarkable attempt for consumption, meant that, in purpose and satisfaction, that the goods of
                    reason were
                    emphatically there.
                    <br>&emsp;The value of this is hard to explain. As the terms used ultimately remark feelings that
                    are not
                    themselves easily expressed. That, or as clear as they are, the sentiment is not compelling. For the
                    pleasure of sex, or comfort of food, is something we know and can relate to. While the solidity one
                    feels
                    while writing inquiries, playing games, relishing shows and film, is not something which holds much
                    insight
                    to the feeling involved. We understand what a good film is, and why thats enjoyable; as are creative
                    efforts
                    somewhat clear in their delight. But these two fall short of any real insight; as we are simply
                    comparing
                    our own time watching a movie, and relating that to the supposed feeling another had while they
                    watched one.
                    And whereas the taste of food and hottness of sex is something that, as an experience, is
                    understood, or at
                    least grapsed as something desired within the activity of food and sex, the actual feeling of
                    watching a
                    movie and things of the sort is not equally understood. Despite our grasp on the activity.
                    <br>&emsp;Foremost do I say this, for the feeling in question is not so universal. As one may be
                    flipping
                    through channels, unervingly unable to rest and enjoy, while another is hooked, satiated by the
                    beginning of
                    the episode, and elated by its finish; and then unable to wait for following previews. These are
                    different
                    experiences within the realm of televsion. And at that, one watching the same show as another may
                    have a
                    different experience. For you may have seen something before, and have sort of interest or respect
                    for the
                    material in play. And by that, like a performance seen before, or better yet, like a roller coaster
                    you've
                    been on previoulsy, 'throw up your hands, this is the best part!'.
                    <br>&emsp;The passions of consumption are in themselves consuming. For the roaring embers of your
                    loins
                    cloud all other cares and judgement; and at that, hover around for anything which can please your
                    excitment.
                    But age and duty lessen the proclivity for such flames. And at that, offer the experiences of
                    pleasure, but
                    not their inflammed excitment. And from that, beyond the satisfaction such pleasure brings, lies
                    around the
                    rest of your time and ways. The points at which, must be filled for living to be claimed.
                    <br>&emsp;My life was such, that that proclivity for excitment was not abily or happily enacted. And
                    so we
                    fondled around, privatley contenting ourself, or mopely despairing over the lack of goods our
                    excitement
                    sought. And indeed from this came much envy towards those seemingly endowed with such affairs.
                    <br>&emsp;It would not be unfair though, that our amends in those days was towards the unmitigating
                    task of
                    school, and its day to day and long term needs. Considering this was our chore, I only wanted free
                    time and
                    comfort with respect to it. And getting girls, partying, things of sort, only came from a job; at
                    least
                    extending yourself into such realm. But doing so brought me outside of the harmony I had with
                    school. In
                    that I would go, do my work sufficiently, then retreat to my points of comfort. Indeed, had I a
                    definite and
                    or extended view of such schooling, than perhaps the goods for that would lead into those loinfull
                    goods.
                    Better yet, considering the merrit of school, and this aversion to abandoning that for the sake of
                    composure
                    needed to have fun elsewhere, that applying myself more for school, and at that gaining composure
                    from that,
                    would more than likely led to those funner goods, but sourced from that composure born of more
                    merritbale
                    extension.
                    <br>&emsp;I never did this though. And besides the factors which led that way, and paired mind you
                    with the
                    mindset which understandibly came from such influences, so did our youth lay, in that we did not
                    embellish
                    our oblige to school in any capacity beyond the point of sufficiency. "As if to make it seem, and at
                    that
                    validate ourselves, by the most minimal stake." But this did not lead to much more than an enormous
                    vista of
                    oblige upon graduation; for we were then asked, and at that personally placed, to do something with
                    ourselves. As if the point of school had been reached, and set us off to the subsquent chapter. But
                    I had
                    barely finished the book; at least I had skimmed through enough to get through school. But upon the
                    next
                    book, our ability and care to read was so minimal, that the tasked seemed a burden. Especially
                    because, in
                    that large oblige, lied no real desire or end from me. And although this describes all yet too
                    little, It
                    can say that our prep in life failed, upon which our motions through the stalemate which followed
                    led to the
                    interest and care for the lane which were still part of.

                    So the abscence of interest seems the core of despair. For even trouble earns us a means to oblige,
                    and at
                    that draw for effort. While an soul which seeks for not, and has no otherwise peace to be, feels
                    both too
                    idle and parched, and otherwise restless in its attempt to find interest. For interest truly is
                    within, and
                    in relation to objects which spurr it. But if we are not able to be drawn, then we look for more,
                    hoping
                    that something more elegant does; or we force the desire, and seek things which we should not, or at
                    least
                    hold our care because we commission them as so; as opposed to them being a response to our spring of
                    interest.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then is upon a life which has been all to hidden and safe, while also rich and
                    solid.
                    Only, the stripes and hues of the later are not so easy to declare. As my interest in sex, namely,
                    feels
                    somewhat begrieving when lost; for I seek not without it, and at that, hold envy to those in
                    pursuit; and at
                    that, I remember past moments of hunger. But compared to liberty and virute, the pursuit is not so
                    clear.
                    For I can see clearly, that our body is quite content and at that able to sit and experience things
                    of an
                    engaging sort. But in other times, I am a little frail, or whithered, and at that, unerved when I am
                    asked
                    to sit and be. "Its like my hands have the shakes, or at least become bitter and restless as I am
                    offered to
                    gently take someones hand."

                    I feel fair in remarking the motions of liberal goods and consumption, as being fit for analysis
                    through the
                    measure of elation, and how the swerviness of such is no good thing to have; and at that, prone to
                    misinterpration in the way that 'the excess' portion (or upswing) is used as a opponent to the
                    otherwise
                    steadyness of liberty; but in that lies confusion regarding the starting point of such excessity,
                    whereby
                    one goes from a plausible equal point as one whose temper is otherwise calm; and in that case, the
                    high from
                    that standard is not so redeeming, in particular when you consider the actual form of such swing (in
                    terms
                    of quality and width), and the more simple notion of 'the downswing', the result of which is often
                    an
                    upheavel back to the standard; which too, holds its own shape and hue.
                    <br>&emsp;In such sense, the flairs of elation, both up and down, are not so desired when you
                    consider the
                    wholesome plunder within a virtuous state, and at that the bitter taste of the downswing and
                    upheavel.
                    <br>&emsp;I have worked through a near arm and a leg to describe such sentiments in my life. For
                    support is
                    an all to forgotten privalge; in the sense that nature is out to get us, and we hold so much which
                    is worth
                    feeling dear about when it comes to our family and friends who stand by us through our response. But
                    that we
                    would live per those descriptions, marks the fact that our life has peered away from what is normal,
                    and at
                    that prone to the wholest of supports. As it were, our time has been such, that our care for virtue
                    has come
                    from a sort of parched resolve, in that the goods of elation were a farce to me. But absent of
                    virtue as
                    well, we were left with an experience which was all worthy of contempt. Only, our cultivation of
                    virtue, as
                    if a commisery to ends worthy of what we were otherwise averse too (in elation), brought with it a
                    fully
                    integral lane for us; which itself, albeit unpitiful, still lacked the acceptence that our elated
                    success
                    would receive.
                    <br>&emsp;Now I stand with much understanding, having ruled the cynic and beggar in me; as not to
                    fold under
                    the lack of support amidst the world, or begrieve those who offer at best their neutral hand. "Who
                    are never
                    elated themselves for our prowess in virtue; merely accepting, and at that ready shame me upon the
                    slightest
                    slip beneath our proclaimed status." But in that lies that the true course of our way, that through
                    the bare
                    embrace to virtue, and our albeit fair yet, in better terms, humble naivety, clambered the currents
                    of care
                    and amends. For in that, ran a dear friendship, between man and himself, through which the world was
                    seen.
                    <br>&emsp;And all our 'descriptions' serve, is a ledger of reasons and defense as to why said stream
                    ought
                    continue flowing. Only, in heartfull matter I know, merrily, that being is all I need.
                    <br>&emsp;"And the lie in life, is that solutions to your problem are in fact the proper course for
                    action;
                    for in my accounts, they are but bracings to the apprhensions born of not being; the strides of
                    which need
                    no candor or stake."

                    Another way to describe elation, is that our experience is generally moving forward, and at that
                    subject to
                    an array of interests and whims, elation being a movement of the latter, whereby the extent of the
                    inclings
                    and rise (be it positive or negative) is more exhorbatant

                    worth
                    commends.
                    <br>&emsp;Our sympathy is not barren though, merely our contribution.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I simply attend to our common matters, namely of virtue, family and friends.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I am no maligned is in our placement within an illustrious world, which holds
                    neither detail
                    in time, nor breadth within the integrity of it. This is the commercialized view, the picterqsue
                    one. And
                    this I do no oblige, for it marks no the bits of world strung together into earth, mammal and man,
                    but
                    rather the theory, tale and practice of it all.
                    <br>&emsp;I am a cynic, and by that fair deficit, admitt only to our curmudgen acceptence of those
                    who
                    critique such matters; and be it with respect or passivity, so do I accept. But of those who
                    blundgeon me
                    with my lack of knowledge or amends in a current world, but not a substantial one, to that wince not
                    at our
                    ill-commission.
                    <br>&emsp;Nucleaur weapons may be used, so be it; as may floodings, typhoons and droughts
                    increasingly
                    occur, so be it; as is crime similarly postered, so be it. This is for the governments of the world
                    to
                    align, and at that the citizens to accept the prospective change. Education is fair, as fair
                    accounts of
                    those who say one thing and mean otherwise; but we ought not pretend like we are anything but what
                    we are,
                    be it the chief executive, secretary of finance, civil employee or resident of the state. "Let
                    virtue
                    breathe commradery, and at that open mindedness to the routes by which we exhibit resourcefullness;
                    and at
                    that, an equal receptivity to other's proposed problems."
                    <br>&emsp;It is said that philosophy, as in all guidance, is aimed at one thing only: to fear not
                    the
                    future, and in all practicality, accept and bestow the ways into death, and at that senility. But so
                    in our
                    common fears, whereby we fret at the commerce of states, or the flamboyance of corporate officials,
                    does the
                    source of our discontent lie in sympathy. For I truly care not what the government gives and takes
                    from me;
                    for by all accounts, my life is fostered by employment and oppertunity. What really irks me, is
                    seeing
                    others in despair, or subject to violence during conflict; these sightings breathe a fury in me,
                    'and purge
                    me towards the state culprit'.
                    <br>&emsp;But so in fear of death and the soul gain of wisdom in guiding us through it, that so in
                    our
                    sympathies to other people, and at that the empathy within that as our similar perrils compare, do
                    we need
                    an equal kind of guidance, or wisdom rather, as to be less elated in our fears and struggle; on par
                    with the
                    sentiments which wisdom produces in order to level out our fears and bearing of death.
                    <br>&emsp;I know not the pain of severe injury, nor the taste of dust as I sleep woefully on the
                    floor. "My
                    own floor is covered with rugs and linens." I can say though, that our sympathy's sprout as our own
                    struggle
                    ceases. And by that, lies a kindred side to the sense which offers peace through death, whereby the
                    sense of
                    propiety and neccessity spurr an equal economic, and by that worldy grace.
                    <br>&emsp;In that though, per our current place, lies one who is endeared to all, if not for a
                    generous
                    angst. For despite our lack of struggle, and a tender sense of the goods I seek, purely, so do I
                    lack much
                    composure when our sympathy for others is flared up. More than that, we are not in any real sense
                    contributing; which offers no grip on the matter.
                    <br>&emsp;What I can say though, that as erotic images flair our libedo, and at that elate what is
                    otherwise
                    a calmer and contendted passion, that so in the media lies a unfettered source as to elate your fear
                    for the
                    sake of others; and at that, the irritation at others causing it.
                    <br>&emsp;And in all ignornace your justness and integrity may lack; but from an understanding which
                    is
                    proportioned and substantiate. "We mustn't measure towns with mile long sticks, for the units become
                    small;
                    nor can the world be represented in anything but miles; yet what I see is a limit to that broader
                    extent,
                    with smaller and fainter measures added onto it, but in no way enough to be circumspect."
                    <br>&emsp;I struggle then, in that of the worlds enormity, my sympthaties are clouded out, for in no
                    fair
                    way can I deeply see. Yet I am somewhat on par with the pace of things, in all there might, and
                    merely
                    keeping along; all the while things occur naturally, and we coalesque with our natural increase of
                    attention
                    and care. Yet when we read or here dramtic statements, we are thrown a little, as if the problem
                    which the
                    world presented was in fact near and clear. I struggle though in seeing this, if only because our
                    sense is
                    otherwise when we are not in view of a small world. For in our greater studies, I keenly compared
                    our sights
                    and senses which are wholesome and appropriate, and those which are righteous, naieve and condensed.

                    So we have our sympathies. And generally speaking, they are more pronounced when our own affairs are
                    dealt
                    with. But so too are they elated by 'sorts' of sources, rumours being an antiquate form.
                    <br>&emsp;My question though, is that, in your generoisty, you'd prefer to exhibit it liberally. But
                    in
                    that, there lies a private emphasis, as if you are merely a spick of sand in the world, and acting
                    as such.
                    But when we are brought out of ourselves, or are irrate at an sentiment, we find that, like those
                    private
                    pursuits, that those aimed civilly are equally curious; or literary we'll say, in inquiry.
                    <br>&emsp;Althought I cannot entirely say, this is the fine line, and at that difference, which
                    marks our
                    true self running with the earths wind, and that of an inflammed and or hungry sort, who sees only
                    what is
                    outside him, and means to respond.

                    We have our truth, and the exploration of it through inquiry. And indeed my desire lies in that
                    course.
                    <br>&emsp;But via our sympathies, we somewhat hanker over it, and at that run ourselves over. Indeed
                    our
                    sympathy and or fear is exasterbated by our consumptions and state, but there the question lays: why
                    are we
                    so drawn to our sympathies, or moved by them rather.
                    <br>&emsp;It may be true that what we mean by sympathy is like a stomach ache a 1000 miles away, and
                    we, in
                    line with our own aches and being, trust and or accept them as being per their own place. We are all
                    on the
                    same stream, but each of us our rowing, and less someone is drowning besides you, those far around
                    hold no
                    means or need of oblige. "Indeed our parched sense of those around such people makes it seem like
                    their
                    perrils are unbounded by support, and antagonism at that."
                    <br>&emsp;In other words, we have the truth, a path to it in the way that a garden is but a
                    blossoming
                    place, yet the value of this is unclear. Again, I feel it comes from our sympahty, whereby the self
                    regard
                    which empathy affords, wherein you share someone's struggle, but thereby hold warrant to priortize
                    yourself,
                    ceases. At that point, you are, by all abscences, free and liberal.
                    <br>&emsp;The truth though, is that we are somewhat sensible to the worlds despair, in the way that
                    we
                    concern ourselves not with every death, in animal or man. Nor we do account for all accidents,
                    injuries,
                    payments and frustrations. Even a rampant genocide is hard to express; for our efforts feel at best
                    communicative, rather than adversarial. It seems right that our understanding sympathizes with those
                    who are
                    misfortuned amidst natures growing ways, all the while knowing that it is from such growth that the
                    misfortune occurs. And from that, our attiude, contributively, is never gripped by financial aid, as
                    the
                    tempests of the situation are at best dulled. Minorly even; though there is merrit in the means for
                    repair.
                    But we somewhat sit here complacent, resting on the reality which produced this, by which,
                    compartively, we
                    accept like a natural disaster -whereby we hold no blame. Nor does this foreign sense, by which
                    through
                    natures flow we trust (is the cause), do we see the actual misfortune any other way; for in that we
                    equally
                    trust, that there is real, as opposed to illustrious struggle.
                    <br>&emsp;In that sense I am wrong. For my mother and father, gautning over the news, pronged in
                    their
                    worldly sense, hold a reaction which is in fact fair. As for the reason, I cannot entirely say. And
                    per our
                    dissedence to such cause, so am I, as in all shortcomings of perfection, understandibly unoritented
                    to such
                    reason, due to our 'less than pronged' impression.
                    <br>&emsp;There though lies the care for truth, as it lets me comfortably and suitably be. Perhaps
                    it is
                    it's own prompt for inquiry, of our contribution. For I may be best and right to join military
                    operations,
                    to volunteer in Africa, teach ESL, or something more community based and local.

                    I might, with literary indulgence, spread our tenants of experience. In a four quadrant view let's
                    say.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, there lies joy; along with the marshalling of it. Then there is struggle, meaning
                    our
                    imperative deed to nature. "For not I or any man alike can fake a grasping breathe without airs
                    prescence."
                    Then their is trauma, or better put, the hues of the world; which might be better defined as the
                    contents of
                    the furthest conception. And then, nicely, lies rest; whereby we see no misfortue or foreign
                    grievence.
                    <br>&emsp;This latter comes quite easily; but it requires a mixture of integral relief from
                    understanding
                    the world, and at that properly stating it's trauma, and at that plea for you to contribute -or
                    sympathize.
                    But alongside this, sits the mob, or common sentiments, and how these, in the push to solitude and
                    or (fair)
                    dependence, causes a grinding friction between you and that 'percieved pedantry and elation'.
                    <br>&emsp;Aside that balance of peace and true sentiment, lies the mirror of joy and struggle. For
                    in one,
                    you are burdened, and at that stripped away. While the other, you have the treats of life for your
                    attention, and at that the self interest to remark upon such travels. "As if I know where I am
                    going, within
                    my freedom and her aim towards such good." Sometimes though, when the balance of sympathy is high,
                    and our
                    peace is more latched onto rather than situtated upon, then our joy feels more novel, and at that a
                    glimmering promise; and by that, despite the sparks of hope which our moment of peace affords, so
                    deep down
                    lies our honest conset to the tears and thicket below.
                    <br>&emsp;And perhaps virtues greatest claim is the blossoming from wise integrity; whereby those
                    brambles
                    are tended, the esscence of such being ethics; and by that, our means to remove ignorance and
                    naievity is
                    equal to our means to explore our dearest treats; all mind you, by the proportioned relation to the
                    world,
                    whereby said removal of bare mindedness raises you above the otherwise small minded frustration with
                    things,
                    and at that the pin on your own peace: the description of which, can best be stated as a formative
                    stance
                    through the world, by which our sight is on all things, and at that prudent for your own deeds, and
                    the
                    sympathy of others. For the proportion of that regard leads your attention to actions which are
                    suited
                    within a completely viewed world. "And your own propiety, family, relationships, peers, collegues,
                    neighbours and the kindred interaction with community and humanity at large, bears you a fairer
                    state."
                    <br>&emsp;And the ethics of your own nature left bare, leave you vulnerable to the impressions of
                    the world;
                    the broader definition of which elevates the sharp and bitter tastes, but no less drenches your
                    stiff
                    pallete.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I stand then, is why we need definition, which is to say to freshen our views with
                    timely
                    sense and accuracy, and not propitiate our receptive instrument. And the anwser truly comes down to
                    morals;
                    particularly those with earthy as ooposed to local remarks. For in that, you more than likely would
                    attend,
                    as would you with ease to your family. But man is always growing, and contacting other locales. And
                    our
                    moral quandery lies in the mystery of those amends; whereby the boundries are removed between us.
                    <br>&emsp;The point being, that you cannnot be entirely perfect so long as the fortune of others has
                    any
                    sort of concern. The nature of said misfortune, and the appropriate response is one thing; and
                    indeed,
                    defintiion removes the risk of error and at that gratuitous sympathy. But so are we somewhat left
                    hollowed
                    and bare, when we are so uninvolved or committed to those around me. It is perhaps are peak towards
                    modernity that has me looking beyond our local borders; but in all our balancing lies therein the
                    farthest
                    end; whereby we act not like people of old, whose idea of success was the triumph of their own folk,
                    even at
                    the expense of others; but for all of mankind.
                    <br>&emsp;For morals can be split into two camps, namely those which are obligate to fighting, as to
                    achieve
                    the ends of duty through opposition; and those which are boundless, or of all people, and beings at
                    that; by
                    which our opposition is to nature; at least that is the mold for our task. "And indeed, it is much
                    easier to
                    accept, holding all of eachothers hands, her task, whereby we all take her hand; rather than taking
                    some of
                    ours in order to break down others." This may be the better path truly. But of its interest, or aim
                    rather,
                    I am not sure what it is beyond the satiety of its people. And nature surely holds no short supply
                    for us
                    all.
                    <br>&emsp;I'd describe then a 'national' sense of unity, as a head down approach; as if such unity
                    is in
                    arms, and at that against others united. But the spoils of that seem somewhat ignored, in terms of
                    the need
                    for such opposition.
                    <br>&emsp;Perhaps I have a conceived interest, whereby natures truest task, in terms of our liberty
                    and end,
                    is such that, all people being proportioned towards that, removes any stragglers for goods sought in
                    opposition: namely food and shelter. The issue though, is that the truth of that human matter is not
                    but of
                    inquiry. And so the reproach from a life whose gain is measured without appropriation to what the
                    contents
                    of such pursuit would be if they were respective of the bearing of such inquiry, is one thats uneasy
                    to
                    sell.

                    So were about 5 podcasts out from E3, and thats real exciting. There are previews, and other vids
                    while were
                    readying up.
                    <br>&emsp;Hume has my eye, in his sense of morals; though I don't see too much which will explain
                    the term.
                    His draw from me is like PLutarch, in that there are words formed into an enlivening theme; while
                    Plutarch
                    speask of listening and content, Hume remarks various tenants of philosophy, along with some
                    parlimentarty/party offerings. Not all are remarkable, as in Plutarch, but rather than see him as
                    someone to
                    read, were simply seeing the portions we like, and caring for them as things said, and by us heard,
                    rather
                    than some productive end. "Which, in my ignorance, is how I see Hegel and Rousseau; their
                    proponents, but I
                    am more keen to the writing."
                    <br>&emsp;Our fitness is quite hole, but teatering due to a lack of core strenght or spinal
                    mobility. These
                    are mere motions that bring life to our day; and in many ways, account for our need to workout. I
                    would
                    simply bear emphasis to such stability, with a slight permission to grind, and at that, do free
                    range or
                    aerobics to keep your vitality up. Cow pose and arm crosses are a great way to release compression
                    from your
                    workouts to. And generally, forward folds, lunges and the increasing means to downward dog open you
                    out. And
                    some leg holds and bridges bear us the brace.
                    <br>&emsp;Food wise, I am hungry. And in our rested state, I feel free to satiate. Sugar is out,
                    calories
                    are on the table. I do see though, in our proportioned day, that bread and grain fairs better than
                    popcorn
                    and chips. We can allow for them for the sake of comfort; but we may also find some good in simply
                    eating
                    greater amounts of the better. Since we are a bit compressed, kale is harder to digest. Nor am I
                    finding it
                    easy to feel hungry for a smoothie during the day; as such food is meant for you to keep going; and
                    indeed I
                    need food, but our tendancy is to seek fuller foods, and the rest which follows.
                    <br>&emsp;Our life then affords the way. For I can overlook our meager amount of food, and simply
                    eat
                    popcorn, oranges and grain. But that we'd do so early is a matter of time; for we may feel overly
                    bundled to
                    sink into such rest; or I am too crunched, and not in a drifting state of rest -whereby we recover
                    from good
                    actions done, rather than being burnt from efforts which burdened our short capacity.
                    <br>&emsp;At that, I can say that our stability is one of wonder, in that with the move in question,
                    and our
                    time at the new home unclear, were sitting a little to crooked in the means of comfort. For we feel
                    like
                    more is coming, and at that in need for us to do. Developments are occuring, for the moment at least
                    regarding the sale; but so is the future of our job and transition up for question; though, via a
                    sale or
                    not, so is the pressure for us to do one thing or the other, and in some manner, less explicit per
                    our
                    progress with the move. For we depend on our mom and dad, and their care and attention is on such
                    affair. We
                    may have to get a job, and the lenght of stay is up for question. Moreso, our cash seems to short to
                    let us
                    move on our own, and so the means and or care of parents rounding out such fund is itself the
                    questionable
                    point. For I don't wish to go to Superstore, recieve orientation, get a schedule and acquainted,
                    then ponder
                    the future move to Vancouver. I could stay through the spring; but our interest and or welcome may
                    ware out.
                    But I'd say, overall, is that time will even out, and the foresight now and its concpetion, are not
                    likely
                    the accurate measures of how such time will be.

                    I see with some strenght, that our appeal in life is to goods born of virute; and that such state is
                    born of
                    aversion to impropiety, and a disposition to its opposite; the motivation of which is born from the
                    stability it offers, and the flourishing which steadily and congenially spurrs.
                    <br>&emsp;Yet, in all opposition, lies a sort of farce. Not so much of those pressing me; for which
                    my
                    family plays the part. Rather, in our awareness of the truth, shortcomings reveal themselves to
                    others, in
                    that our actions correspond only to what we know; and even in foregin lands, less we abandon
                    relations with
                    such sources, so are we left with a trembling to their expectations: as we have nothing positive.
                    <br>&emsp;Central to this are paternal values. As friendly and or romantic relations are like long
                    summers;
                    lucky to have come, but with no damantion upon winters coming.
                    <br>&emsp;Rather, children situtate themselves as the soul concern; in society, from our mother and
                    father,
                    and at that the judgement of others around, commending and or disputing me for my actions as they
                    proper to
                    such oblige.
                    <br>&emsp;To begin, beyond traditin and what other people expect, there is no duty in having
                    children. The
                    government does not request; nor are you censored in rights or oppertunity. You are at best subject
                    to
                    scrutiny, pity or indifferent dissapproval by folks familiar with the matter. "And indeed, modernity
                    has
                    brought with it a decrease in the passions of such contempt; nor has the expectation of such afairs
                    remained
                    a custom."
                    <br>&emsp;But, we are all people. And as friendship and romance are to be expected, akin to one's
                    sensible
                    course amidst the comfort of food, so is it fair to expect, or predict rather, that children will be
                    sought,
                    and by that sentiment, had.
                    <br>&emsp;This is comparable to a kids eventual interest in a car; and despite not requiring it, so
                    would
                    the value and or interest predicted to come, be tailored with the approval of actions set one for
                    such
                    achievment. Children are no different, in that the foresight of their coming, per an assumed
                    interest,
                    elevates actions as worthy of approval --or not- in succeeding in such action.
                    <br>&emsp;For all contention and praise in the matter comes down to the requisites for parenthood;
                    in that
                    you must birth, shelter, feed and raise the kid. And of the needs which one's expereicne, or common
                    sentiment (as inhereted) have shown to be useful and or essential in meeting such matters, so doth
                    wisdom
                    lay.
                    <br>&emsp;For all men generally wish well for another. At least, of the concerns men have, it is
                    usually
                    within the sphere of those which they'd deem kindred. And by that, as tenants for certain tasks are
                    inhereted, so does such guidance get passed along. And so a young man will be prompted by their
                    families
                    guidance, via the assumption they have that he has certain interests, and their experience in what
                    is
                    effective for the matter; the union being one of parent's care for him to succeed, and thus offering
                    him
                    what they can that they esteem useful.
                    <br>&emsp;And indeed, as a young man myself, I find that, misguided or not, that the interests of
                    such
                    sentiment are such that it is rarely of little benefit to at least heed such input. For even if
                    those who
                    care for you are fools, you can at least expect that their intent is good. By that, I submitt myself
                    to
                    their words in order to listen to something worth my time. Which is not how most discourse is
                    occasioned, in
                    that, less I beleive there will be worth, then I afford no attention. Whereas to those who I care
                    for, and
                    at that see as caring for me, I bear such attention without pretense of profit. There may be none,
                    and at
                    that, I continue to see them as I had. But their relation to me bears them a constant welcome to try
                    and
                    suggest something.
                    <br>&emsp;Where lifes friction comes to fight, is not neccessarily when said offerings are of no
                    benefit;
                    rather when said inputs are not given with our own welcome to take them or not. But instead, there
                    is a
                    mixture of indigence at our not accepting what is said. That, and of the ways we are presumed to
                    take
                    otherwise, there is a sentiment of pity and disgrace; as if, what was offered confidently as
                    something good
                    for me, upon not being adhered to, colors me with actions that are then not good; which invites the
                    sense
                    that we are thus not doing well, despite the esteemable offer.
                    <br>&emsp;The cause of this entanglement is not one that has much basis in the relation; for in
                    that, there
                    would be one if I bore no attention. But seeing as I do, and the concern is one of accpeting such
                    offer,
                    that the reason I do not, is comparable to the reason that the dissent from the offer bears
                    conflict:
                    namely, that those offering such sense, beleive it to be true.
                    <br>&emsp;And to halt our inquiry, I'll simply say, that as for the lineage of one's belief, and the
                    crossover between folk, be it strangers or relatives, that such matters are set in the means by
                    which
                    knowledge is acquired at all. "And the according relations which exhibit themselves based on such
                    material."
                    But aside from that, lies the matters of our believe. Beyond our disputes with others who see
                    otherwise,
                    there is, by our character and right, a bound of liberty to both enjoy and heed such beliefs, and at
                    that
                    their steps and ends.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, lies our core principle, which is that a child is something you attent to, and
                    oblige
                    yourself to its helpless need. Romance is a matter of interest; and despite the loss, both parties
                    continue
                    to be. While the loss of a parent by a child is a damning sentence. For despite their comparble
                    trouble in
                    remaining happy, they also cannot feed themselves. If it were the old times, then their inability to
                    gather
                    food would be a complete sentence. Nor in modernity, where employment is concerned, would their lack
                    of so
                    warrant them any stock of food -or shelter. And so bar none, our regard for a child should be a
                    moral one,
                    rather than a fancy.
                    <br>&emsp;And it being so, is a challenge, as I know not how our own life should be. But,
                    considering morals
                    to be defined along the lines of duty, we can at least be imperfect in out attempt to be
                    responsabile. While
                    the whims guided by fancy seem more like dreams and passion; and albeit fair and pleasurable, are
                    not
                    themselves productive, but rather gains. "In other words, one's regard for children is comparable to
                    all
                    regards, in that their are means and ends. But whereas the failure of a relationship is but a cease
                    of the
                    end, so is a failure of parenting a failure of another's being. And by that, we can say, that easy
                    or not,
                    that the duty to a child is of the highest order; and by all fair accounts, ought not be 'handled'
                    with
                    impairment, nor oversight to things we'd thus be ignorant of."
                    <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this, is that the measure by which we happily and neccessarily raise our
                    child
                    by, ought be whole and complete; and by that, not garnered by convention or approval, but by the
                    measure. To
                    be clear, this is not to say, that if our principle for rearing is to have our kid be well, that our
                    particular case of something be decided by that; as such a statement is not actionable. Rather, we
                    ought
                    have some sense as to what we need, in terms of home, food, prospects. For the ends of our child
                    will be
                    such, that by their own whims, and furnished in their own manner, that such elements will be what we
                    provide
                    for them while they are being cared for and raised: differing only in the complexion relevant to
                    that age.
                    <br>&emsp;To return to my inquiry, I am left questioning the merrits and or need for dental work.
                    That, and
                    the neccessity of optics, nutrition, conduct of living, space, education, commradery and being
                    social; that,
                    and the limitations born of childhood, and how travel and employment ought be prepped for and
                    advanced. For
                    it is hard to say what I need as a parent, when the need of my child is unclear. No one debates the
                    need to
                    feed them, and at that whether or not they be fed; but seeing as 'feeding' could vary in
                    constitution, so is
                    it a principle of mine, and at that a fair assumption, that some constitutions will be better;
                    leaving then
                    the question as to what knoweldge or sense leans something as being better; or better said, as
                    having
                    qualities and or effects which are worth higher degrees of approval. "For it is one thing to say
                    that I will
                    feed my kid well, and to do so by not feeding them pop and donuts. But what about the degrees of
                    benefit,
                    and the various forms which things can take to be deemed such. A general measure is what our general
                    sentiment accords, in that we have a general sense of what is good as to correspond with our
                    interest in
                    offering a general benefit. But if we want something riper than that, then so we'll need an equal
                    kind of
                    sense."

                    What I seek for my child is akin to what I seek from me, liberty. But this aim is only strong as I
                    truly
                    seek it: and per our desire, our ignornace throws us off. For liberty is under attack; namely from
                    public,
                    or at least what is percieved as public, opinion. For in that, my morals are otherwise to my family,
                    relations and explicilty so to my child. Moreover, I have a propiatated sense as to treat others
                    kindly,
                    help them in need, or at least be kindred in what they say. Surrounding this though is worldly
                    sentiment; be
                    it from the town over, the kindgom, our people's land, or the relation of such commune with others.
                    <br>&emsp;Our sensibility here is not without promise, in that our awarness of such breadth may
                    offer us
                    freedom from the pangs of stretched concepts; which is to say, that in seeing the world, in meters
                    or miles,
                    we are somewhat subject to it as a realm of thinking. Even if our pleasures and effort surround what
                    is
                    local and dear to us, so is there a foregin, if not adversial sense far and abound. And we may, upon
                    being
                    subject to such sense/extent, remove the risk for inflammed fears or passion which a lack of
                    understading of
                    such breadth imbides.
                    <br>&emsp;Beyond that though, there is a frustration which rears deep within me. Namely, there are
                    representatives, and some common discourse, which remarks the affairs of such world, be it from
                    sympanthy or
                    our relation to something. But unfortunately, there is a sense of imperative, and at that a glare of
                    those
                    inflammed passions which we are all to weary of. And it is one thing, upon seeing more of reality
                    and
                    experiencing the doubts of it, and removing such pang, and hearing others who seem equally
                    distressed, and
                    at that doubtfull, but have leaned in, and at that overlooked their ignorance. On one hand, there is
                    the
                    matter of our discontent of others being so impassioned; as such cries of distress flurry our own
                    view of
                    things, and at that reveal more ignornance: making it thus hard to feel sensible enough. It is
                    another thing
                    though, that in our response to such 'increase to the point of content', that we'd be critical of
                    those who
                    are the cause of such; and at that, our cynicims spurrs up as a sort of righteousness, as if what
                    was fair
                    enough to know in order to give our realtion with the world some peace, that so, in others not as
                    situated,
                    that their passion then is some sort of flaw. It may be such, but it is our own sensitivity which
                    prods us
                    to define them. This is a difficult sentiment, as the merrit in seeing them as 'unrigthfully
                    impassioned' is
                    not far off; but taht we are put off by it is more a remark of our self, and the amiability we have
                    to any
                    sort of ignorance. "As if we padded all the edges to an obsessive degree; but upon someone knocking
                    at the
                    door, I flinch: and is that a problem with their manners, or me?"
                    <br>&emsp;So it is hard for me to say that liberty is what I seek, for I am somewhat seperate from
                    the
                    lingering fears brought on by other people's expression. Our own sentiment about the world is both
                    large and
                    ironed out. But our place in life is such that our composure is more peacefull than it is of luster;
                    and so
                    we get thrown off easier by those clambering around. "And indeed this may be a choice away from
                    remedying
                    back to a relation with the world which is not so intruded upon, fairly at least; for she herself
                    shows me
                    her harshest sides, or at least points out where I have imagined concepts. But upon seeing the truth
                    and
                    letting it sink in, it is only our inactive place amidst such conception that has me feeling off,
                    when
                    others are more apparent in their sense that the world is otherwise." That is the route of solitude.
                    <br>&emsp;For it seems natural and fair, that our place in the world would be approved of and
                    preferred had
                    we run the course entirely, rather than starting half way through our life. And at that, I can say,
                    in all
                    our best subtly, that our child will have that regard from me. To the effect, that their liberty
                    will be as
                    bound as mine, but not so from reproach and fortuity. And by that, their full strides will keep them
                    steady
                    and unaverse to the crowd's singing. That, and their own strides, as remark the stature and care of
                    a man,
                    will have more means and pleasure in furthering the moral bound; whereby they may be more invovled
                    in
                    kingdom, the world even. "While we are just squandering our ability to at peace with our friends and
                    family."
                    <br>&emsp;In that sense, I have a clearer picture what to do. For the same question I have right
                    now, is one
                    that perhaps indicates an awnser; namely, because of our concern, so will our child reach a similar
                    point,
                    where they are asking what they ought raise their child to be, and at that, what is a) their oblige,
                    as a
                    mixture of duty and interest, and b) how they can achieve this without negligence or oversight, and
                    at that,
                    succeed with excellence -so what they offer is not merely good, but swell.
                    <br>&emsp;First off, as my need for a child is my choice, so will our child be the same. And by
                    that, as we
                    are given suggestions and care by the assumption that we naturally will want to have kids, that so
                    will my
                    child revieve such assumption. "Not that they must have a kid, but that seeing as they will at some
                    point
                    wish to, how can we rear them for such."
                    <br>&emsp;But foremost in our sentiments, is one of liberty, as opposed to confinement. For in one,
                    the
                    means we seek are those which relieve our troubles; and generally, this is the basis for all our
                    actions.
                    But where liberty differs, is that in our success we don't merely indulge in the excess of those
                    elements,
                    but rather propitiate ourselves to to others matters. For seeing the sun bears no need, and at that
                    holds no
                    essential care. But it serves as an instance whici liberties merrit and need reflect. Namely, that
                    of those
                    excesses of what we basically need, so do these, in excess, blunt our ability and care to see the
                    richer
                    things of the world. Second though, is that beyond such pleasant sights, that we may a) wish to see
                    further,
                    and at that better --as to see the sun is not much more than the bright ball in the sky; while in
                    truth it
                    holds a deeper complexion; and b) contribute towards such matters, in the postive sense that we
                    respond
                    neccessarily to the prompts imbued by nature within us, to treat our hunger and fear; only in this
                    case, the
                    draw is towards something positive, as if a satiety to our curiisity and wonder, rather than our
                    baser
                    needs.
                    <br>&emsp;In that sense, we could summize our nature as being one of need; but properly characterize
                    such
                    need as some range of emphasis within a domain of interests wishing to be ceasesed (or full); the
                    gambit of
                    which covers our hunger, wonder, reverence, lust. And not to get derailed, but liberty -as we ought
                    mention
                    what it is- is really just a measure of baser successes, whereby the sight of wonder is given the
                    time to
                    seek, be drawn, and at that be heard, when the pleas of our hunger are equally fufilled. The point
                    being,
                    that withtout air, the concern of food is gone, and water at that. But soon, upon the satiation from
                    those
                    and warmth, we reach a point where our finer instruments can open up, be prompted, and oblige our
                    draw.
                    <br>&emsp;No matter, the important note is that along those lines of excess, there lies a sort of
                    stubborness and discipline; whereby the means to such satiety are deemed adversarial, and at that
                    constantly
                    fleeing away. Even if we have enough, and so much that we have more than enough often, there sits
                    this
                    attitud of 'and you musn't let it go, for it will flee away'. Because of this though, there is this
                    fear to
                    focus on things beyond those baser matters. And the reuslt is that contents of those matters get
                    overly
                    emphasized, to an indulgent effect. "For people find stability, but act with respect to it in terms
                    of
                    smoothing their efforts spent on reaching so, or applying themselves as to reach deeper means of
                    provision."
                    But the matter of satiety is fairly objective. Not so much in your means to seed what is neccessary,
                    but
                    what is neccessary. For some indeed do not have enough for what is needed; and at that, are fair to
                    value
                    finding said means. But if you have such means, and are situated somewhat as to maintain them, then
                    the
                    goods on offer are additional, and at that uneccessary. Better yet, if the means to neccessity are
                    enhanced,
                    then you are sitting with profits, as your expenses are more or less payed. And to be fair, meeting
                    those
                    finer tastes does cost money, or at least benefits from such; but in that case it is unessential. At
                    least
                    in terms of the employment towards such things. And from that, the primary means to food and shelter
                    is
                    money, while our finer tastes are advanced through attention; which is, upon the satiety of those
                    former,
                    given reign to. And so working for more money, either bears more food, which causes an all likely
                    indulgence; or softens your means to attending to those finer interests. Though these benefits are
                    in some
                    cases mere novelty, and at that, born from distractions and or draining committments; which has more
                    of a
                    negative effect on your finer attentions, as your time is spent immoderatley elsewhere. For
                    circumstances do
                    change, in time and localle, but generally speaking our means to neccessity are small. And so long
                    as we are
                    propiated to the sufficeincy of such, then the manner of means is fair. And at that, if the course
                    to such
                    means is all consuming, so be it. But as much as it is not, so is our excess of time free for finer
                    attentions. "We can at least have this sense in mind."

                    To bring this together, our childs life is characterized by our excellent vision of it; whereby the
                    felicitous goods of our finer interests hold the fairer dream. That is our hope at least. And in
                    line with
                    that, so would our child be reared with the sense that they would have a similar interest, and at
                    that the
                    means to foster a similar dream (for their own child).
                    <br>&emsp;In this though lies a broad concept, namely of equity. Whereby that sense of furthering
                    our means,
                    and at that the pecuniary goods from them, that so lays the common notion of fortune, and our
                    benefit in
                    nurturing it. I do feel like an obvious weakness of this course is clear, as accruing fortune is not
                    in
                    itself advantageous; as the extraction of the accrued funds for use is needed in order for the
                    benefit to be
                    made. "And it is hard to say when you cut off some of the pie." That, and considering our finer
                    interests,
                    so are the attentions for equity draining in terms of the required maintence and appointment. And as
                    formentioned, our aim is of that dream, whereby our higher interests flourish. And as stated, these
                    benefit
                    only novelly from things beyond our needs.
                    <br>&emsp;As a result, our pecuniary care for ourselves and the family to come, is one which more
                    aptly
                    acheives sufficiency. For it is admittedly a chore to work common jobs; nor do those that offer
                    higher wages
                    and ways leave us with as much rigor as we'd please. In all honesty, our modern sense of this is a
                    litle
                    conflicted; as our current time is indeed privaleged to work from home, and through finer means;
                    which
                    themselves afford higher wages then lower jobs, and are generally more hospitable to our health.
                    Even so, if
                    we were a plumber, so would we be one because we applied ourselve to some better means of providing
                    for
                    ourself.
                    <br>&emsp;In all fairness, the scope of our life is not so easy to state. And from that, there may
                    be but a
                    limited sight, in terms of future decades, which our regards struggle to content. But in general,
                    commnon
                    jobs can leave us robust and provided for; that, and they may be achieved without application. I am
                    merely
                    saying, then beyond one's childhood, that they may infuse their liberty, and privalege of
                    application, to
                    form themselves for preferred means. And at any rate, their broader interests, as remark things of a
                    civil
                    and or professed sort, fall equally under this line. And as to conclude, granting the limited scope
                    of our
                    life's end, that so will baser and or applied means to sufficiency reflect the complexion of our
                    commensurate duties. "Contrasting what they are traditionally, in careers, perk packages and
                    pension." These
                    may hold essential benefits; but each item is to be measured seperated from the nicety of something
                    offering
                    one.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, we can remark the slippery notions of dental, optics, babysitting. Along with the
                    more
                    definite, yet demanding in principle situation, of living arrangments, schooling, and the otherwise
                    commiserability of the expected 'oddities' in this, with the common rungs of the world. The rungs
                    mind you,
                    which hold neccessary elements of infancy, namely in being around other people; along with the
                    likely
                    interests in later friendship, romance, cooperation and esteem.
                    <br>&emsp;Let us start though with that notion of working from home or not. I cannot say how this
                    relates to
                    times of the past; though I give myself some leniancy, in that of the understadning of how our life
                    would go
                    along, by our liberal standard even, that so might those hold more unity via the simplicity of said
                    times;
                    or at least whatever those standards were, so would the nature of work be according to that, and
                    thus not so
                    relevant now.
                    <br>&emsp;I will say though that working from home removes alot of hurdles. For one, it does not
                    impact what
                    our child does, in the way they live; for it is merely a matter of whether we drive to work,
                    complete our
                    shift, then return home, compared to starting our shift at home, being there through our shift for
                    the
                    benefit of pleasure and need, and returning to living all while being at home. There is the question
                    of
                    education and people, but babysitting gets removed primarily as our prescence at home fills the
                    otherwise
                    task. That, and our managment of shifts between my partner and self is simpler, as someone (if not
                    both)
                    will always be at home. And indeed this affords some leaway for a potential partner to work out of
                    home; or
                    myself even if they work from home.
                    <br>&emsp;As regards dental, my feeling is that a great deal of its value comes from remedying what
                    is
                    otherwise a result of ill health. And seeing as health is natural to our dearer interests, and
                    quality of
                    life in general, then so do dental issues reach less prominence. Orthodontics may not be worth
                    regarding;
                    but are cleanings even, which I have not partook in since my younger years, become but situationally
                    required -or of worth. And by that, the regard for them is much further then our cares for routine
                    living,
                    but of some irregular expense. I see optics similarly, and less so even as the presumed cost is
                    likely in
                    the low hundreds, and final at that. While dentistry might hold a higher fee, and regular at that.
                    But of
                    any pretense that it is essential, or advantagous, I'd remark the lack of prescence of it through
                    all but
                    the recent century, and how the manner of health likely causes such concerns, and at that, upon good
                    heealth, alleviates them.
                    <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I think it'd be fair to offer a sample outline of our finances. For
                    one,
                    working from home holds no expected difference in pricing. Certain costs of living may be
                    introduced, but
                    the actual means is different. Moreover, there are likely health plans afforded by those at-work
                    scenarios.
                    Though, I must note the general state provision for such. No matter, if I and my partner are equal
                    in
                    income, then 25$ per hour, 20 hours per week, is 4000$ a month. At 30 hours, were at 6000$.
                    <br>&emsp;I submitt that a car is not needed. Beyond the people our child will associate with, there
                    really
                    is no other need. I can remark the need in emergencies, or in order to meet appointments, but these
                    concerns
                    range in prevalence --considerably moreso during early infancy-- along with preference, as less our
                    child
                    cannot walk, then we can otherwise reach appointments. And there are such things as strollers for
                    all things
                    non emergency. "A doctors visit comes to mind."
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, what I see, for my life and my partners, is a constance of days which is
                    blossomed
                    through our provisions, into a time full of games, reading, tv and craft; along with local living,
                    and land
                    travels. There is the notion of far off travel, and our childs requisite of walking, speaking, and
                    general
                    sense; but this remark holds with it other matters regarding essential and social need. So no
                    matter, my
                    life, like all others, is local; and mine and my partners life is such, that as adults, we need no
                    car. Nor
                    do we need much more than room for television and sleeping. Floor living is an odd comment, but more
                    or
                    less, a little space for living is fine. Establishing values, we can say that there are indeed
                    preferences,
                    and such as regard sound upon the years of infancy, but in terms of space, only an amount needed for
                    what
                    our lives constitute is required. That, and as much as that is fitting and our life is in motion, so
                    do
                    those preferences loose their luster. Moreso, because our needs are easily met, so can we select
                    places with
                    preferred features, namely location. In that, being nearby a park is a god send, for we, as adults,
                    can walk
                    there, play and read; as can our child go there with us, become healthy, find means for rest and at
                    that
                    interest; and otherwise bear him into stateliness: 'as all adults behave like kids, in their emtion
                    at
                    least, when their inactive; and so is the risk for our kid (in all his procolviity to do so)
                    <br>&emsp;less so'.
                    <br>&emsp;As a quick note, in terms of savings, as might remark the timely needs of the infant, or
                    the prep
                    required for their presumed need of things, so may we live according to that prep; and in line with
                    our
                    choice to have the kid, so may we act with equal deliberation regarding funds; considering what we
                    need, and
                    taking some time to fufill that. In parallel with that, is the notion of retirement, and how the
                    point in
                    which you can do so, or afford to at least, can be sensed an age prior, and prepped for.
                    <br>&emsp;Now, concerning strict funds, the essential matter are those elements of routine living.
                    For all
                    other expenses are unclear, and at that met by our own fortunes and effort. I admitt there may be
                    more, in
                    preference or need; but I also rest on the tenants of simplicity, and how the expectations of others
                    things,
                    however common, relly come because we are undefined in the more basic matters. "And I do consent to
                    taking
                    those matters seriously, as to then afford the leisure of principle and chance." In that, our cost
                    of living
                    as a couple is likely 2000 for rent, or 2500 if more space is needed. Then, you have 800 for food
                    and
                    beverage, and really not much more. In that case, to have shelter and bread, would cost between near
                    3000,
                    perhaps a bit more. But on those basic grounds, we can afford such working 20 hours a week at 25$ an
                    hour.
                    And as I submitt an honest examination of our needs, I also permitt myself on the basis of the
                    natural
                    increase in wages and time. For the case of our lives is ultimately one of activity; and considering
                    the
                    irrelvance of extra money for such, we'd choose a robust job that pays less yet enough, or work
                    fewer hours
                    rather than more, for the sake of activity. But considering our attempt to have a child, and
                    dreaming even
                    of us both working from home, so could we raise our hours to 30 a week, and at that, go from 4000 to
                    6000 a
                    month. If our expenses were 4000, which in all honesty, considering 2500 for a basement, and 1500
                    for food
                    (and no car), so would that extra cash be free for saving. And by that, we could, by our middle
                    class
                    earnings paired with lower class frugality, save 20,000$ in a year. "And who couldn't afford a baby
                    carriage
                    after that." And surely the preperation in terms of tools and some rainy day funds could be made
                    during the
                    pregnancy even. For working at home has that benefit, in that the lesser amount of labor affords
                    those
                    pregnant to work more and later into the semesters.

                    Let us begin with ourself.
                    <br>&emsp;We are fine, yet somewhat burdened by prior effort. This is normal, yet our response to
                    such ware
                    is where we find trouble.
                    <br>&emsp;For in our amends we mean to recover. Yet, in prioritizing such, we are unengaged with
                    other
                    affairs. Personally, there is nothing I lack; yet as regards the ultimate means for family, so are
                    we
                    unadvanced or set.
                    <br>&emsp;Weirdly, our life is best summarized as a fine attempt to be ourself, while giving mere
                    regards to
                    the likely future. We settle ourselves unknowingly, but happily on our principle basis; whereby
                    simplicity,
                    such position in the times, and our otherwise humble needs, fair us no mountainous task. "Will I be
                    able to
                    complete my meager task in 10 years time, I do not know; but I am confident on its simple basis, and
                    our
                    trajectory as dervied from past steps; whereby we can see that we'll naturally improve."
                    <br>&emsp;In this though lies our contention. For such a remission from gripping the means to your
                    future is
                    not given much approval, or respect at that. And, as the complexion of our relations with others, so
                    is a
                    scenario where such relations see me as dependant, than so does that whiff of contempt (by said
                    others) make
                    me feel pusehd up against the wall.
                    <br>&emsp;I don't beleive this to be the truth assessment; but our feeling is more or less, that our
                    wish to
                    oblige our self, while not being so advanced for the future, and mixed within our scenario of
                    dependance,
                    whereby we have asks and needs from said others who are concerned of such future, leaves me feeling
                    averse,
                    and at that seeking some place without such contention.
                    <br>&emsp;But this is not the right statement. For we are fine, and our deeds are realy not so poor
                    in
                    thesmelves, nor so contentious.
                    <br>&emsp;What is really occuring is that we don't know what we want to do. It is not so much that
                    we are
                    clear, but letting the present bloom into the future. Rather, that future is not so defined, and at
                    that,
                    prepped for our gradual possession. Instead, it seems, in all infant garulity, that in our care for
                    rest,
                    and the aversion to others wishing me to focus otherwise, that I in fact seek not so much that
                    gradual
                    advance, and at that permission to be right now, but rather to not advance at all, and simply be:
                    whereby
                    the coarsest of interest comes to parse, namely dreams and gratuity. "For I reach for some concept
                    far
                    ahead, but so rash and lustfull that it only holds bounds within our pondering moment; a point I
                    wish to
                    remain at. Moreover, I yearn for an abandoment for that future, in plans or character, and to
                    otherwise live
                    as though there were no rules at all; so that, be it in gluttony or epicurean ends, so may my
                    current
                    pleasure be the soul amend. All mind you, with a measure of consent or reproach based on such
                    pleasure; the
                    indulgence of which, holds permitt to be, then moderate from. Yet duty holds no right to overstep
                    then
                    retreat: for she is always in need to rightly proceed -rather than stopping, erring, then returing
                    to an
                    idle point of less gratuity."
                    <br>&emsp;I might state an unwelcomed remark, namely that of those around me, who hold so much
                    emphasis of
                    the future, that they do so because there angles and humors are off that stationary being -and the
                    wishes
                    around it. And because life holds no warrant or reward for such effort, so do they learn. "For I
                    know not
                    one grown up who is so able and wise, who wasn't at some point a lustfull teen, or gorging loaf."
                    <br>&emsp;In that it is somewhat easier to see how they learned what they did, and at that believed
                    in; of
                    which we receive.
                    <br>&emsp;But I think in all scenarios, there is a lack of character to begin with; and a remaining
                    abscence
                    upon their 'maturing'. For the point at hand, is that the future is unknown; and despite certain
                    wants and
                    needs, that sensibility and principle can curtail both a satiable and easy satisfaction. Whereas
                    those who
                    age with characters of a contrary sort, are merely forced to move via life's tasks. But they don't
                    suddenly
                    become inbalmed to principled living; merely one which is more appropriate to nature's ways.
                    <br>&emsp;The point to clarify then, is how a state of indolence and gratuity get converted into
                    responsability, and the disposition for it. For the thing I'd note, is that the transition from the
                    former
                    to the latter does not remove the tendancies or cares of the former. Rather, amidst lifes bends,
                    there sits
                    spots in need of oblige. And of such younger wants, so must they be subsisted by such obligations.
                    "As such
                    amends mark the means to be: of which our wants are laid upon." On route of this, one either
                    developes
                    better means to subsist in their younger ways; or such ways become propitated to a life which the
                    obligate
                    ways spurr. For being responsabile does not always excite our younger passions, but rather activites
                    and
                    comforts which are more productive, and at that conformable to the itinerary and effort of our
                    deeds.
                    <br>&emsp;But we musn't flinch from the fair description of what we see. Namely, that as obligations
                    are
                    ahdered to, so does the remaining effort, or time rather, exhibit itself in those younger ways. The
                    colors
                    and hues may alter, or the form rather. But the nature remains; in that you drink one way in the
                    younger
                    state, and in another in the responsible one. "But the orbit of wine remains." In this sense, we
                    could
                    describe someone as a mix of oblige and the character proper to it, and a surrounding medley of in
                    between
                    affairs.

                    On saturday morning we are leaving for Pitt Meadows. On Friday, we are picking up the trailer and
                    loading
                    all the furniture; and those we are moving downstairs on thursday. I have books, shavers and
                    garabage in the
                    bathroom, t-shirts, jeans and some bagged clothes on the top closet shelf, along with a lego pack

                    garage.
                    <br>&emsp;Tomorrow being Tuesday, we do not need too much food. We have some apples and oranges, 1

                    By my accounts, the merrit of metaphysics is based on the sentiment of 'neccessity', and its
                    relation to
                    being and goodness.
                    <br>&emsp;For on one end, there is a basic inquiry as to how things became, in motion and substance,
                    from
                    nothing; and that even if they held a constant existence, that of there peculiar motions --as to
                    create the
                    features we deem objective-- that so is this equally unclear. For one may say that in substance and
                    motion,
                    that such things are asietic, or constant rather. There still lies though the issue of composites,
                    or the
                    evident objects we see. "Even if all was but a sliver off in terms of trajectory, so would
                    uniformity be
                    absent." And at that, considering reality as a whole, the question lies in the concession that its
                    material
                    and impetus is innate and constant; yet the orientation of each strand is not so clear; or in other
                    words,
                    'if we take it to be true that there are forms which remark a lack of isotropy, then how does this
                    inherently occur'. For you come to the question of parts and wholes. Considering that all is but a
                    mixture
                    of slight differences, how do such differences occur? The common notion is that, akin to the fabric
                    of a
                    sheet, that so may it ripple here and there, while remaining whole. The mystery though, is what
                    causes any
                    such ripples? There is no evidence that what we take to be objects are but compositions of the
                    slightest
                    ripples. Yet, of such small ripples, why would they compound into the complexities we see today, or
                    in the
                    infant stage of existence, if said ripples were not oriented differently. "For if they were in fact
                    equal in
                    their orientation, wouldn't the result, however extensive due to there being motion at all, be one
                    that was
                    uniform? And thus, how are such strands oriented differently than others, if not for their own
                    uniqueness
                    compared to them. But as so, what springs each piece to be a certain way? Or better yet, less there
                    be some
                    guided emphasis, why would each piece, in its being and end, differ from any other?"
                    <br>&emsp;There is something taken for granted in all of this though, and it primarily falls into
                    the
                    thinking that our portion of the supposed 'force', or spirit, which guides all into being, is in
                    fact
                    something for us to reunite with upon our cease of objective being. "As if the food on the plate was
                    done,
                    and all that was left was the platter: the baseness of which, is viewed as something to desire, in
                    that of
                    our deepest end, to be souly with such (baseness), means we have won." And this indeed leads to the
                    sentiment that 'our objective body' as guided by the plate, weighs it down; and thus, upon such
                    release from
                    said body, that the portion of nature's plate is all thats left, 'leaving us pure'.
                    <br>&emsp;Science, and indeed sceptical inquiry, 'or a method of advancement rather than angsty
                    conclusion',
                    means to demonstrate that the basis for such notions is unfounded, and at that, truly discover more
                    about
                    nature; and by that, our relation to it. The method of this is one thing, and indeed it differs than
                    the
                    scholastic or abstract. But foremost in the trail of promiscuties (produced by the latter) is the
                    abbrasive
                    notion that without the prescence of a nature which remarks the tenants of such, that the world is
                    otherwise
                    evil. "For how am I suppose to be pure, and at that emablmed with the fairest of things."
                    <br>&emsp;My response is almost impossible, as it ultimatley leans on the strength of our beliefs in
                    the
                    contraries of neccessity. For in that, I say, that the denial of metaphysics is not merely a
                    reorienting of
                    one's place within it; namely, that per the norm, that in that deeper realm (upon death) we return
                    to, our
                    rebuke of metaphysics does not claim that this 'salvation' is merely denied, but rather the concept
                    of such
                    realm entirely. And the promiscuity in this, is that most folk have little idea of how things move
                    in a
                    'unneccessary way', that so do they have little concpetion of the 'unneccesary way' of death. And so
                    when I
                    say, that not only is there no realm for your soul, but not a soul entirely, you are left with the
                    mystery
                    of true death. But such an idea ought not frighten us at all. For even if it did, it would be in all
                    likelihood the apprhension of what sent you there, namely things which constitute threats. But the
                    irony is
                    that most folk who have a handle on the soul-realm concept, hold a sort of ambivolence to such
                    threats: 'for
                    they throw me not into a place I'm afraid of; and at that, offer but a different means to the same
                    end: an
                    end which I am all to happy to reach. And the route to such point, in terms of what happens to me
                    (as our
                    own choices do stear us a litte), is generally irrelevant: so do as you please'. And all the while
                    the fear
                    from living stirrs them not, as the consquences are somewhat muted, so are we distraught without
                    such ends
                    in mind; whereby we succumb to the fear of danger, and at that the contention of there being no
                    sturdying
                    end. Yet there is such a place; one which compares to the peace found in rest, or the tranquility in
                    deep
                    sleeping. "A state which, like those, is equally dark, void of dreams or discomfort, nor distaste
                    for the
                    lack of comfort; for like those who feel held by the body, so is such an experience (of deep sleep)
                    one
                    which exhibits the qualities found when one is seperate from the body: death being a mirror of that,
                    but
                    constant."
                    <br>&emsp;In that, the truth otherwise considering the illusion of a dual realm and soul, is
                    unknown. But as
                    I know not the truth in the earth's orbit, or the composition of matter, so am I aware of their
                    complexions,
                    and at that character. And as features of a mystery I do not know, so am I content in the qualities
                    of such
                    feature; in the same way that I am all to pleased to not be without air. And by that, beyond our
                    faith in
                    discovery, and at that understanding through inquiry, of the term good, and its contrary of evil, 'I
                    accept
                    the sentence of death in all it's nativety'; the peace of which, makes the truth unremarkable. "For
                    my life,
                    like those subject to danger, yet with ambivolence upon their end's security, is all too gracefull
                    in the
                    meagerest of fortune; in that such a state is colored by an abscence of danger; which upon the
                    removal of
                    beasts and famine, holds little attention by me. "

                    So a contract is a fair point of security. As are dealings towards one but prospective, but not yet
                    securing.
                    <br>&emsp;In that sense, I must state that my views of peoples aims in life, and at that methods to
                    reach
                    them, is ill thought, antiquated, and at that contrary to the purer things worth seeking. But as we
                    are not
                    so imbued by the choices of others, so do I feel like I have to prove our own merrit within the path
                    we
                    take. The problem though comes down to aims; for we are not merely reaching for the same thing but
                    through a
                    different method; nor do we have some way of living which is proposed to reach the points sought by
                    other
                    methods.
                    <br>&emsp;Where the notion of contract comes in, is that I see, in our own way of being, that of our
                    confidence in it, that so is it fair as much as we have a contract; which is to say that we are
                    secure in
                    our place -wherever that may be.
                    <br>&emsp;For I ultimately feel like we are asked to be something, and at that define ourselves and
                    reach
                    such end. For if we are otherwise, then we are but exploring, inquiring, seeing things as we
                    gradually be;
                    but such a pace is not so respected; and foremost is it tricky to share. For less I communicate why
                    we are
                    not grasping for common ends, or one of our own, then we are left with a sort of shaded development;
                    one
                    which hankers little over the future and its outcome, but merely blossoms as it be's right now. "But
                    it is
                    oh so hard to convene yourself amidst elders, or those inbued to their ways, when to an end you are
                    not
                    endowed."
                    <br>&emsp;Our ultimate concern is not one which remarks a soul, but rather a united state of nature
                    in which
                    our forms are merely part of. And to that, our familie's along with our own ends, are in finality
                    such. "So
                    I dredd any reality wherehy the gluttonies of pain are shrewd upon them, or even those primitavley
                    moral and
                    or natural fair; but that they'd be thrown to such ends, is not but assuring; for such finality (in
                    access
                    or complexion) differs not by any entry."
                    <br>&emsp;But so in life ought we work to be pleased; for we need to in many ways, 'less our stomach
                    forever
                    grumbles'. But beyond the natural futility of this, 'seeing as the ends are the same', so can we
                    respect the
                    fact that we are alive, and at that with cognizance of such ends, but all the while we live. In that
                    sense,
                    our idea of the end is but a kind of idea, as would compare to other kinds --of the present or
                    future. And
                    so from that, we can rightfully amend to the cares of our living, and at that settle on that
                    ultimate fact
                    as if it were but a further kind of regard, as compared to those more pressing. "For our fear of
                    death, or
                    address of it at least, is for the sake of fortifying ourself against nearer concerns; as a final
                    sense
                    angles the meaning of everything as to be accordingly set and kept." The crucial sentiment though,
                    is that
                    although all that we do is in peace or attempt for such end, that seeing as such an end holds no
                    'requisite'
                    to it's entry, but rather a mere understanding as to know its ultimate offer is freely had, that so
                    in our
                    security and rest upon such understanding, can we do as we presently please.
                    <br>&emsp;With that in mind, might we be a little principled in this, and as all past men have,
                    concern
                    ourselves with the aim of our living.
                    <br>&emsp;To be clear, that living and the aim within it hold a warrant for us to address, so has
                    that been
                    stated. "And favorably so, for most of a man's regards are so as to remove unseen or predicted
                    threats (and
                    consqeunces), as to then earn the ease of living as his more 'pleasingly tuned senses' care for."
                    Culture
                    thus is a primary tailoring of such 'unpleasant regards'; whereby the experiences of one's
                    negligence and or
                    ignorance in the world bears them an insight and or lesson to learn, and then share: culture being
                    the sum
                    of attitudes and principles which collaesque said experiences, and faciliate them into societal
                    norms and
                    custom.
                    <br>&emsp;My feeling though, and where I stand, is that as one grievence is dealt with, in food
                    let's say,
                    and another subsquently --upon our attention and care opening up- that so is our final concer of
                    death, and
                    the mystery of being an ending point whereby our fears are dispersed --which the soul, or 'other
                    realm' is
                    neccessitated as the fair attribution. By that, the whims of us which are not endowed and or
                    'naturally'
                    disposed to aversion and risk have warrant and ease to flair, and in that blossom towards the grades
                    of the
                    world which postively attract us. "The point being that such relations are proportionally stirred,
                    as the
                    whims which brace towards things which appear negative, and at that spurr apprhension, cease."
                    <br>&emsp;Bringing it all together then, the world is a certain way, but considering it as food and
                    platter
                    is flawed. And per older ways, the soul is not a present concept. No matter, the fairer view of
                    death, or
                    one in unity, is such that the experience is A) preferable, as one feels in the deepest of rest, and
                    B)
                    reached by the ceasing of one's form; which exhibits them as not being dead; and as such, occurs by
                    any
                    means which such form ceases. With this being so, our place within such form, whereby the experience
                    of
                    living is at hand, so may we concern ourseles with worries and threats nearer than our final end.
                    "As such
                    an end is not something we must prepare for, but merely accept so much as we care to know, and are
                    insecure
                    without. But in knowing how it is effortlessly reached, and at that not so unfavorable upon entry,
                    so may
                    it, as a mere kind of concern within the domain of all worries, be set aside happily: like our
                    hunger had
                    been satiated, and thus there was no attention brought to mention: all the while mind you, other
                    pangs worth
                    mentioning (by memory or throbbig) can be addressed: and at that naturally orient you as so."
                    <br>&emsp;And by that remark, one may say that pleasure is a servant to pain, 'for no amount of what
                    pleases
                    us could subsit for the oitment to our grasp for air'. And by that, only such a treatment is of
                    concern, and
                    as such a neccessity. But considering that such requirment is met, then so are we free to pleasantly
                    be.
                    "For I am indeed pleased with the air around me; yet this is not effectivley so when it is absent;
                    for I am
                    not then lacing what pleases me, but what I need. In the same way without heat I am desparetly in
                    need;
                    while having enough gives mention to the amount which is of excess, and at that pleasing."
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, seeing as pain is brought on by a thwarting our needs, then so is an abscence
                    of such
                    need a remark of our natural expression of what pleases us. In that sense, stability is the means to
                    such
                    pleasure; while the weakness of the former bears no fair or effective strenght to the latter.

                    me down due to that haze; as their permeability gets blurred, and thus I stirr to keep them defined.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I might benefit in stating some terms, then elaborating on them. First, is
                    pleasure,
                    which is not in its own right good, but rather an objective remark; or a description rather, per our
                    common
                    ways, as is the case for the appearence of red, or warmth of a fire. In the same light as a stars
                    motion as
                    seen through observation, yet not known entirely but the mystery of motion in itself, so do such
                    'descriped', if not experienced remarks, account for all things beyond that mysterious realm;
                    pleasure and
                    pain of which, are but a memebr of such domain. And in that sense, 'the good and bad', in a purely
                    rational
                    sense, sit in those shaded depths --where the sentiments of motion, substance and being lie.
                    <br>&emsp;In this sense, the ethics of our time are inconclusive. Or to quote Russel, 'laudible or
                    not, of
                    all theories which pruport a scale for right and wrong, none ought be reaosnably accepted'.
                    <br>&emsp;And so in that way, all we have is a presumed, if not misguided attempt towards the real
                    good; and
                    the all to likely prejudice of what we feel to pleasurable, or at least preffered (as found in
                    experience),
                    as a leaning factor towards what the utlimate good either is, or would correspond too, in the sense
                    that of
                    the pleasure we normally experience, and that such an experience is more or less deemed good, than
                    so would
                    the real one serve but a compartively higher amount.
                    <br>&emsp;And like many things, the Humean notion comes to mind, in that of any idea or sense of
                    what the
                    good would be, we are really referring to what we already experience as good, or consider to be; but
                    in that
                    there lies only what is personally positive; and the good seems but a source of something which
                    would offer
                    but a richer form of what we've already experienced. This assumption though, is built on the fact,
                    that of
                    the good, we presume it to be postive upon being with it; and as such, what we've already
                    experienced as
                    positive is but an instance of some other good, differing only in the form of it. And the highest
                    good, or
                    true one which ethics is concerned with, is but the fairest form to acquaint with. The point though,
                    is that
                    what we imagine such a relation to be, and at that worth in doing so, is in the experiences we've
                    already
                    had which build in prejudices of what the true good would bring, and at that be.
                    <br>&emsp;For it is hard to say what the good is outside of your common experience. For it is said
                    that the
                    soul binds to our body, and at that releases upon death; and from there finds a the supposed good.
                    "As if
                    being released from the world back into the fairest meadow." This notion though, in its oldness,
                    seems all
                    to promising, and built as such (in the terms) to mould such promise. Besides that, sits a sort of
                    neccessary moulding, as if a lack of knowledge of the good, and thus resolve to it, will lead to
                    evil; or
                    negative experiences rather. Again, this seems to fall prey to the prejudice of what we presume to
                    bad, and
                    thus the motivations for finding the truth and adhering to it bear themselves from the aversions
                    within our
                    experience. Morevover, if we look at things frankly, then the prescence of a soul, and at that
                    other-realm
                    whereby our own portion of such is set for, is not a theory worth accepting. Foremost, is that the
                    basis for
                    it comes from the supposed neccessity of there being so. But per the being of things, so is this but
                    an
                    absent thought as regards the worlds complexion; in that of the phenomena we see, that it is our
                    ignorance
                    to other worldly elements causing such mystery that has us believing something arbitray caused them.
                    Moreover, if we look at the question deeply, we will see, less we have faith in the ways of such
                    arbitrary
                    force, or at least faith in the conduct of it, all the while we understand little of such conduct,
                    that the
                    question left to us is equal to the sensible mystery of the 'piece like' components of the baser
                    world. For
                    no matter our ignornace there, there is almost surely a lingering question of cause, and at that
                    impetus;
                    the origin of substance too. When we lean on neccessity though, we are really permitting ourselves
                    to
                    conclude based on an explantion which we believe is there neccessarily; yet we have no understanding
                    of the
                    ways in which such 'neccessity' occurs. And even if we attribute good intention of it, we merely
                    have faith
                    and not knowledge.
                    <br>&emsp;This creates a permiscious scenario. For the argument may be that knowledge is the
                    mighteous of
                    interests, and faith is but an appeal to what we have no basis to be true, yet believe in by the
                    intention
                    we attribute to such mystery. The contrary of this holds no reign, despite our uncertainty of
                    knowledge. For
                    that attribution of intent is itself born from knowledge; at least, how can you truly say that the
                    neccessity which faciliates the world has you in mind, or if so, is benevolent? And one may say,
                    'well, that
                    is fair, but having no truth means that we won't know what to do at all; and tradition does indeed
                    fortell
                    the meaness of human nature, and the then required discipline; the conduct of which, is born from
                    the moral
                    refinement that comes from some scale for approval: in which we form ourselves against.' And to this
                    I say
                    sure, that is itself fair. But we musn't make the common mistake of thinking that our fears of
                    uncertainty,
                    or incomplete morality --in truth or givens- is worth anything more than what we commonly deem as
                    unfavorable, and at that worth 'being good' to avoid. In this way, we are left to the givens of
                    reflection
                    and deliberation, and the all to wordly prominence of pleasure and pain; and by which means or
                    another, that
                    so do we give ourselves a natural placement as to be as we naturally are, in terms of such
                    experiences.
                    <br>&emsp;What I mean then to say, is that if we are to marshal ourselves based on experience, then
                    we ought
                    not pretend like the motivations we have are born from anything other. For we do not know if the
                    sentiment
                    of defintiion is fair, or if it is but a linguistic behavor, and at that feature of our nature. In
                    any case,
                    if we mean to live by givens and principle, then we are effectively giving into prejudice, and at
                    that
                    experience; the procedure of which ought exhibit itself through the propieties of evidence and
                    inquiry.
                    "Where we merely account for, then ask; chartering whats been, and where the meaning may be."

                    So it would seem, for practicalies sake, that if we merely remarked upon our experineces, and with a
                    practical given of pleasure and pain, that so would things go well, as far as such factors were
                    invovled.
                    <br>&emsp;But we have such a trouble in simply doing this. For beyond the problem with defining
                    pleasure and
                    pain, that so is the act of remaking them an equally ambiguous affair. And just as we say, that our
                    efforts
                    are not true but rather as remarks our experience, that so is the 'remarking' equally untrue, but a
                    given we
                    take. "And so we are left with an ambigous means to an ambiguous end; and thus are stuck in a
                    logical brace.
                    And only our permission of prejudice, and at that dismissal and or ignorance of tradtional
                    prejudice, afford
                    us any starting place: wherey givens can be made, and of the simplest kind."

                    All comes down to being. For I might say that our response to things is featured in our use of
                    language; as
                    is our structural composure a response to gravity; or our use of pens and tools, which are features
                    of our
                    dexterity.
                    <br>&emsp;But in this, lies a sort of trouble, in that how we are is baked into the question as to
                    how
                    anything is at all. For the modern notion is that all, or all of us, is but a part of nature's form,
                    and of
                    our portion, 'so are we a strand'.
                    <br>&emsp;On one end, you have the remark of the earth's orbit, and the insight that the mass of the
                    sun
                    draws it to do so; compared to a heavy object in the center of a sheet, and how it moulds the plane
                    as for
                    surrounding things to fall inwards ---or orbit if they have their own initial vecolity, as to create
                    centrigul motion. In this case, what was a blatant observation of the earth orbiting the sun, as the
                    moon
                    orbiting the earth, so was this not itself the point in which the depths of reality lay: beyond that
                    is.
                    Rather, it was as if a deck of cards formed into a tower, and of such form that was all you saw. But
                    upon
                    inspection, you saw the cards, and at that the actual elements in question. But as for their own
                    basis, so
                    would that be closer to any supposed 'depths'; compared to the higher form at least.
                    <br>&emsp;In terms of knowledge then, we have what is apparnet, and at that regarded. But deeper as
                    we go,
                    so do things which appear phenomal have some objective reason. And indeed, the faith in reason is
                    such, that
                    no matter how deep you go, or better yet, considering the depths to which we've been, we still hold
                    faith
                    that a) more light will be shown, and b) that any mystery per the level we've reached, holds a
                    rational
                    explanation below.
                    <br>&emsp;In this way, our knowledge can be expressed by sentiments which are observed and
                    understood, and
                    those which hold either a faith as to their rational cause, or one of an arbitraty sort --which we
                    presume
                    neccessary.
                    <br>&emsp;Considering that, our model of life is such, that the phenomena of language and sensation
                    are but
                    nestled in the rocky alcoves of objectivity. And like all chemical elements, which serve as the
                    deeper
                    reasons for higher forms, yet hold themselves a rational source in particles and forces, that so are
                    the
                    subjects of language and mind elements of an equal sort; only, like all dinosaurs that were, and of
                    the
                    fossils which remain, so are the discoveries of mentality but remains of something not yet
                    uncovered; yet
                    with faith, we believe they are there; and at that, our model states that such things are not but
                    ill-observed elements within the higher world. Their pecularitiy, and at that need to be further
                    observed,
                    does remark the mysteries of the deepest of things. For the nature of iron is not much more than the
                    nature
                    of charges and forces particularly arranged. Yet, while iron is quite understood, as an object and
                    with
                    cause, so is the deeper mystery of its cause more easily set, 'for we are clear what the mystery's
                    towards'.
                    While the mind is not rightly presumed to be a part of the world in a distinct way compared to all
                    other
                    things; but in its own way, we hold smaller definitions and much ambiguity. And considering then
                    that for
                    nearly all things the deepest basis is unknown, then so is the link between that and the unclear
                    effect of
                    'mind', a hotspot for ill-concieved imagination. "For we tend to define that deeper cause in order
                    to anwser
                    the pecularity of the consquent object of the mind; yet the ill-clarity of the latter awkwardly
                    motivates
                    the cause of it to be a certain way; for we both have too little guidelines to propose such cause,
                    and at
                    that, a awry bias in our want to understanding such mindfull effect, to the ends that we make the
                    cause of
                    it in such a way that what we suppose and or preusme the mind to be, as then caused by the manner of
                    something which we deem neccessary to produce what we assume as such. Yet within the mystery irony
                    lay."
                    <br>&emsp;At this point, it is only fair to resort to inquiry. And as one in the past may have
                    resorted to
                    faith in the esteemed causes which they held as being with intent for them, that so may we, in the
                    denial of
                    that, and otherwise ignorance of any pre-concieved form or being, that so our faith lies in the
                    frontiers
                    where reason lay.
                    <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst these rules, is that in attributing the cause of something apparent with
                    the
                    properties deemed essential, you are still subjecting your understanding of such to the measures
                    which
                    knowledge is found on; and accordingly, if your understanding is ill-placed and guided, then of the
                    truth
                    you do not know. "It is as if a ball was in motion, and your prompted as to whether it came to be so
                    by
                    means of its identity, or another's. And in attributing the latter to something beyond, you really
                    are
                    placing it as nothing more than a prior dominoe; with properties of an esteemed kind mind you, but
                    of
                    properties no less." Asserting then that such properties are present because the effect which they
                    are
                    esteemed to cause could not be so otherwise, is a proof that holds little resistance to all but the
                    faintess
                    wind.
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed though, certifying this as the base of our inquiry is in itself essential. Namely,
                    why the
                    properties of a cause, as relate to its effect, cannot, nor would not be so if in fact, as stated,
                    'were
                    neccessary, for the effect could not otherwise be'? How is this not true then? Is the attribution
                    wrong, in
                    terms of what is deemed to be required for the effect, and thus the cause? Or perhaps the cause is
                    credited
                    with an end which is itself misunderstood. As if we saw red, but were decieved from the truth in it
                    being a
                    different color. For indeed this is where metaphysics lies, in that weaving of cause and effect. In
                    all
                    fairness, the latter is quite easy to isolate, and formulate as something false in the end
                    attributed to the
                    cause. Yet, even with accuracy to the effect, there still lies something essential. And one's faith
                    in
                    reason is akin to the belief that a discovery will be made. While the belief that the cause produced
                    said
                    effect due to something neccessary, is all but the toughest claims to refute. For I do not know any
                    reason
                    for the effect; and at that, denying the property lauded as the cause, or amidst the being of said
                    clause,
                    is without much validity beyond the speculative prejudice I have; in terms of explaning something by
                    an
                    irrevent factor distinct from the effect itself, but something imposing upon it instead. "While it
                    is not
                    much more than hydrogen and oxygen being that corresponds with their binding into H20. Yet the force
                    of
                    their meeting is the question. Only then though, are we left with the prescence and slight
                    differentation of
                    the field which exhibits the basic particles and forces. And I find little meaning in the neccessity
                    banked
                    on as the explanation of that."

                    Of ends, so may we falsify attribued means on the basis that the effect of such cause is in itself
                    ill-founded. "So and so is the source for this thing happening; but if that thing is in fact not
                    happening,
                    in dynamics or substance, then so is the proported clause false. At least, that gravity causes the
                    earth to
                    orbit the sun is true, but that it causes our heartbeat (its rythyn at least) is not a reason which
                    falsifies gravity, less it is proposed as the source for so."
                    <br>&emsp;Propositions then are a tricky statement, for falsity and truth therein lie. Yet
                    description falls
                    a little short of what they offer, in that their aim is one of explanation, while the other is
                    merely
                    observation. No matter, if I say that iron is but a meddley of particle, so is this true; while
                    saying that
                    quarks are a meddley of particles is not; but this holds no bearing to either of the subjects,
                    rather the
                    quality of their stated relation.
                    <br>&emsp;In this way, one's faith in reason is really one or refutation towards the claim that in
                    being or
                    substance, that so the basis for thing lays. For I may say that atoms are soul, and at that born
                    from the
                    qualities neccessary to proport them. But in doubt, and upon findings, I may deny that, and use such
                    evidence or reasoning to support my falsified claim.
                    <br>&emsp;Where we lie then, is how even the deepest of understandings will be either a) born of
                    reason
                    rather than neccessity, and of such matter known, or b) how in our doubts and or thinking as to the
                    further
                    depths where reason lie, how we know that, at the very least, nothing other will do, whether we have
                    any
                    glimmer of hope, or merely have faith in so; and as such, rest on our uncertainty and inquiry,
                    encouraged by
                    faith and at that the revelations through progress, all the while we care little for, and at that
                    seek to
                    deny, the sentiments which exclaim some non-rational basis for things: as if reason, or its promsing
                    depths,
                    hold nothing more but what neccessity is required to grow.
                    <br>&emsp;That is our trouble. Not the strenghts of our inquiry, and at that encouragment of the
                    gains so
                    far; but whether it is futile to look deeper or explore, but instead accept the infalluable fact
                    that the
                    features we seek explanation's for, are so from something not discoverable; or in other words real,
                    but
                    rather transcendetally moulded and guided.

                    In this way, the canvas of reality is painted two fold: of completeness, be it of the real we
                    suppose real
                    or not, but entirely so, or of distinction, or otherly rather realms: transendance if you will,
                    whereby that
                    existent realm is cushioned by some resonant other; and of such other, so is it the source for
                    substance and
                    being, i.e properties of mass and magnitude. While the soul realm, or one which, akin to pantheism,
                    is
                    entire, is not one that sees its elements as imposed upon, but rather with immanence.
                    <br>&emsp;For each there is a difficulty; though one seems less laudible. In the dual realm, there
                    lies the
                    mystery of how the other-realm functions, and at that, of its own nature as the guiding force for
                    the real
                    realm. While the complete realm, holds the weakness of ostentation, whereby we ad finitum reach the
                    defintivie quandery of space, form and differentiation. In this case, we can say, that the
                    speculative
                    theory of entirey, is such, that of the complexity we see, so is it sourced from an aggregation of
                    the
                    meagerest differences; the apparent effect being but a compounding of the real entities, and their
                    slightly
                    slivered differences sewing together.
                    <br>&emsp;In some sense, the dual real theory is perhaps the most skeptical. For it does not propose
                    how
                    such other-realm faciliates the features of extistence we see. Instead, it is generally deemed by
                    neccessity
                    that the means to such existence are caused by properties which are not themselves real or
                    explanable, but
                    merely required for anything to be at all. For our point was that the nature of such other-realm was
                    not
                    itself understood. But we are then attributing characteristics to it which we find in existence. "As
                    if
                    there were motions in the other-realm which spurred the motions in the existant realm." But this is
                    not the
                    actual claim of the theory. Rather, it states, that unlike existence, which ebbs and flows in
                    certain ways,
                    that the other-realm, or neccessary cause, is not itself real, and at that subject to any
                    understanding as
                    we'd find in the effect it produces. Personally, this is the frankest statement of, 'it is what it
                    is';
                    which to me, as a ultimate theory, is quite skeptical. Though, in all fairness, the nature of such
                    theory is
                    such, that it does not support any inquiry into the conduct of its cause; but rather accpets them
                    --with
                    right statement-- as required for the explantion we seek to be claimed.
                    <br>&emsp;The main issue though, is where do the neccessary, or otherly qualities and the existant
                    ones
                    begin. For we may say that being is innate, and at that, the effect of motion is born from some
                    unqualified
                    force. And we may accept this as true. Yet, understanding how such a force produces the motions we
                    see is
                    mightliy unclear. At that, we can rightly falsify any 'neccessary' statement on the basis that the
                    effect in
                    question is not fairly stated. Which itself, holds a reccessive issue, in that, as effects appear in
                    their
                    composite form, that so is their actual form an unknown point in which said neccessary causes would
                    unfold.
                    And in that sense, it is quite hard to say what any neccessary cause is, when the proported effect
                    of it is
                    unknown. "For how can something be attributed a cause, when there is no clear effect for it to be a
                    source
                    of. How can we state something as being the means, when there is no (fairly stated) end for it to be
                    reckoned as spurring. For it would seem that of such end, that so is it so, and as such reasonably
                    deemed,
                    by a cause which is in such a way as to create such end. Yet, of such way, how can we rightly say
                    what it
                    is, when the ends which said ways are reckoned to be so as to create such end, are not themselves
                    known."
                    <br>&emsp;To me then, the weakness of an imposed theory, is that it does not question the composite
                    nature
                    which we mean to explain; moreover, it cannot say what the true elements are, in the early 21st
                    century at
                    least. And that, so much as this weakness holds, 'whereby it affirms a cause to an end with no
                    further
                    basis', than so are you left with a never ending point of real-explanation. For less we rightly and
                    or
                    wrongly affirm the identity of something, and thus subject it completely as the thing for which a
                    cause is
                    proported to make, then so is it fairer to expect that our perpetous discovery of the identity of
                    things
                    will illustrate the explanation which we affored to those 'neccessary causes'. In that case, ought
                    the soul
                    question of our inquiry be, 'at what point do we affirm; at what point does our curisoity feel
                    satiated by
                    the things we really know?' For death, mind, space and magnitude may be understood in the way that
                    we've
                    learned about light, mechanics, organics and such. To which we have one question to ask: is there
                    any more
                    worth to our inquiry? For if every person were adbundantly pleased, and absent of pain, nor were
                    there any
                    doubts of the entrence and or quality of our tranistions within existence, and at that any such
                    doubt as to
                    the conduct of existence as it pertains to our relations with the world, and that such relations
                    were based
                    on findings which held forward and true by the constance of said nature, and at that the lack of
                    suspension
                    and or intrusion, then so might we merely settle some finer despairs, namely in the realm of
                    language, and
                    the other features of the mysterious sides of existence; all the while though, we held no trouble at
                    all but
                    accepting our peace and liberty through life and the stream of infinity. "For at that point, as man,
                    for
                    pleasure, and in the richest of states, are we charged with being as we are liberty to see fit; and
                    by that,
                    forgo, and at that shed, off those behaviros and concerns of primitive disposition."

                    So I am here, in Pitt meadows. And I'd like to remark a certain bit of closure; namely of the
                    relevance of
                    other people's thoughts, and our otherwise begrudgement about not being invovled with the things
                    they are so
                    flippant about. In that, we normally feel like the advice, and our wisdom and fair guidance, say to
                    mind
                    your own buisness; attend to it at least. But in doing so, we tend to feel like we are ignoring the
                    buisness
                    of others; which I can only say, in our simplicity, does not hold any fear in me; but there is
                    indeed the
                    hurt you sense in others. And at that, I feel conflicted in disposing our time and attention to our
                    own
                    efforts, all while 'the apparent distress' of others is left for someone else to tend. The point
                    however, is
                    that despite this feeling, so is right that our idea of this would be well-founded, and that we
                    wouldn't let
                    imagery, rhetoric, quick conlcusions form our idea of things; and at that, so would individual
                    circusmtances
                    be but random occurences; while remarking upon the world could only be done so with a broader sense
                    and
                    statistics. And upon that view, so are the ruffledness of others response to near sighted views,
                    encourage
                    me to think of the greater good. But so as remarks our irreverence to the seamingly odd occurences,
                    yet
                    amidst a world I am either ignorant of, or with the sense that it is normal, and at that not so
                    pointed
                    towards another's suffering, that so in this approach, are we left with the right mindest. Yet, we
                    feel that
                    others remarks about it are so caved in, and at that full of irratable confusion. Only, what I see
                    is that
                    despitre there being this way, and in such a way as remarks passing conversation, or that at a
                    dinner party
                    (so to speak), that so is it assuring that such moments of seemingly 'in tune' disccsion, despite
                    the empty
                    custom and falir of it all, is all but a moment whereby people's social strides combine with their
                    ignornace, and they say 'trump', or 'get this'; but so do they move on, to occupation, seperate
                    converstions, or relevant interests to their day. And by that, I am not upset to be outside such
                    discussion,
                    and begrieve at that consquences of such flaunty conversation. Nor, do I fear taht such converse
                    leads to
                    irriatbale reactions; as if people would then contribtue towards a the problem they think has
                    occured, and
                    at that be rebellious, dissarayed, anarachic, and brutal. "There is not much of that outswide the
                    despots of
                    Cairo or Sudan."
                    <br>&emsp;There will be more developments upon that sure; but what I can say, is that of the fairer
                    view of
                    the world I see, and at that the reproach towards such view, whereby our judgement is suspended, I
                    think I
                    can appropriately be as a single man within the extent of the world; and at that, consider our place
                    within
                    such extent, all the while we are begrieved not, or nor affraid, of flippant and or passive remarks
                    regarding faintly viewed things.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, I have little to comment on in terms of proper custom. What I can say, is
                    that we are
                    here, in Pitt Meadows, lauding the bounty of fruit. And beyond our rustling harmony of concerns I
                    ought to
                    approve, so are we left with the normal course of our life. I can say that health is a prioirity,
                    and
                    besides our moral remarks and enlightenment reading, so is there little but our woodland ventures
                    and homely
                    actions. These are all nice and plenty; though I am somewhat unsure of things in the near term, and
                    so
                    paying 50$ for a short campagin, additional map area, and new game mode, seems a little rich
                    consdiering the
                    means we have. I am not sure if I am overly excited to merely try the base mechanics.

                    Might I iron out a loose thread in my mind, namely that of variable forms of discussion; be it
                    promotional,
                    organized, civil, or more along the lines of scoffing and barking, or being talkative and social.
                    <br>&emsp;None truly bother me. For the latter kinds do not lead heavily into the effects aimed at
                    by the
                    former. It is true that such aims are in relation to our representative interests, and at that the
                    right by
                    said interested to democratically convene. But in the case of talk and scoff, so is this quite
                    seperate from
                    the choices eventually made; and at that, any reall contribution to the matter: be it positive or of
                    revolt.
                    <br>&emsp;In terms of those organized and deeply expressive, so are these doing what is fair and
                    appropriate
                    within a state of affairs which faciliates itself on public consent. Whether or not that public is
                    really
                    influenced by said expressions one thing; and that, so much as they are, if it is towards revolt or
                    educated
                    consent, so lies a mystery. "For I remark the recent sentiment of class and orientation equality,
                    and the
                    general scoffing of folks who see such statements as 'over the top'. What I see in fact, is not that
                    in the
                    common walk of theres or any ones lives, that such expressions remark an actual change; beside the
                    barest
                    and most deeply packed policies; but instead, there thrown off by the notion due to ignorance, and
                    how such
                    ignorance thwarts their sense of normacy and security: the consquence being one of hidden fears that
                    they
                    are being supressed, and at that, upset by an equaly deep sympathy for someone other who they feel
                    is being
                    oppressed."

                    peace and happiness from our life without said family; and thereby acquaint ourselves with the means

                    so there consent is well-oriented.

                    So it is all to concerning when a person draws their view of the world by the incidents they see.
                    For
                    presumably, there sentiment is one that remarks a supposed world as to produce such incident.
                    <br>&emsp;I would illustrate things this way. There is a light source, and it shines in all
                    directions.
                    Then, there is debris, scattered if you will surrounding it --a spherical orbit. As the line shines,
                    it
                    catches such partciles and creates a sort of figure; of which we are impressed.
                    <br>&emsp;By my accounts, the government, or culture at least which is mixed in, speaks to the
                    light; while
                    the surrounding material in which it shines marks the actual tenants of the world, in people namely.
                    And so
                    if some incident is seen, there is generally two responses: 'man, people are crazy', or, 'damn,
                    those people
                    (of a country or place) are messed up': that, or it is 'why does the government allow this? Like did
                    you see
                    what some guy did: the states is nuts'. Of that latter, it might be better to state it as a sort of
                    confused
                    irriation, as to how either a people or state can permitt such things, and at that, not remedy them
                    in some
                    supposedly proper way.
                    <br>&emsp;The main point I would make, is that not only is the light source as less than prominent
                    cause of
                    those impressions we, compared to the elements shined upon, but that even so, if such light was what
                    caused
                    such a figure to occur, that so would this not speak to the other elements being shined upon. For in
                    that,
                    the glimmers of oddity and despair speak out in ways that both eagerly and crookedly catch our eye.
                    Yet it
                    is perhaps a fair definition of ignorance to say, that being unware of how the less than striking
                    forms
                    appear, and at that, having no solid basis as to ground your impression of something odd, speaks to
                    something worth our concern, in terms of someone exhibiting such ignorance and rashness.
                    <br>&emsp;In our own way then, an ignorance as to how people are in general, and at that groups of
                    them, in
                    general or specifically, makes room for our own irrations upon hearing someone else be so rash; as
                    we
                    attribute their feeling to be one of commen sentiment, which is an alarming feeling, in that you
                    perceive
                    the common folk as then being rash. Yet, I find it important, that even if we suspend or own
                    judgements, and
                    are not elated by incidents, that so is someones contary response but an incident itself, and at
                    that, not
                    often an incident which holds huge amounts of weight. "For someone who is rash and negative, and at
                    that
                    flippantly topical, but an instigator to other people's shared proclivites; but as such, is not an
                    expressor
                    of something many people care for or respect; and thus, doing so yourself is seldom rewarded; and of
                    such
                    aversion, so may others get sucked into to being equally unappealing. But akin to a mob, which
                    supports
                    others who get invovled in their fury, that upon the mobs cease, so are you left out in amidst the
                    prefferred customs; to which you stand alone as you remain rash, or you then revert back to the
                    acceptable
                    ways."

                    What ought a man ought to do? I cannot say I know. As regards felicitous pleasure, and peacefull
                    absence of
                    pain, of that I know quite much. But that such a principle would be invoked, seems but a personal
                    pursuit;
                    and at that, not what others exhibit around.
                    <br>&emsp;Oddly though, it is not so easy to describe their efforts as anything but. Only, it seems
                    what is
                    regarded as worthy of concern, and otherwise worth seeking, is varied from mine. In that, the notion
                    of
                    utility and pleasure is quite universal in its appeal. And only the apolagists or endowed saints
                    (and their
                    disciples) have much character or need for qualities which pertain to something beyond life. They
                    are not
                    unwise on the whole of it though; for their efforts keep their pleasures moderate yet fair, and
                    their pains
                    at a minimum; nor are their duties dealt with in toil.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, the principle one uses is always the mighty question. For in the advancment
                    of
                    whichever point we choose, so are we fair to accept the knowledge we have, and merely make do with
                    it while
                    we further learn. At that, assessing things in terms of a principle is as easy as such a thing is
                    understood. "For the sweetness of soda will offer such and such; but of one of those offerings, in
                    the
                    glycemic load namely, in terms of utility contrariety lays."
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed, it would be proper to better define such principle. For if the mere sentiment of
                    pleasure
                    is whats regarded, then such sweetness of soda may remark a higher good than that of an orange. But
                    if the
                    scale for measurment includes in it qualities such as accessibility and consistency, the latter
                    being a mark
                    of what the good from health can afford, then the effect of soda despite its sweetness does not
                    align.
                    <br>&emsp;What I find tricky though, is that in deciding on the principle of utility, or that of
                    idoltry, so
                    there lays a deeper mystery than the mere alignment of comprable things; but rather the actual
                    discovery of
                    what a) the complexion of such principle should be, and b) what the core of the principle is based
                    on; or in
                    other words, what merrits deciding one principle over the other. For that latter mark strikes me as
                    something quite overlooked when it comes to orienting our morals and interests. And the likley
                    reason, is
                    that of whats required to learn about a principle, and at that what bears promsie to a principle of
                    any
                    sort, that in such needed discovery to establish such basic things, that by legacy and it's
                    continued
                    propogation, so do the contents relevant to such discovery already appear to be stated. Just as one
                    may say,
                    that in utility, that accesibilit ought be a concern. For the pleasure of a donut may be fine, but
                    not if
                    you must hike a mountain to recieve it. While the pleasure of a deep breathe, and the creative
                    strides that
                    merrily come, holds a sort of good that is born within, and from there simply. This is all part of
                    the
                    discourse as pertains to objects and their relation to value. But as the alignment of such things is
                    but a
                    matter of understanding them, that so in the acceptence of the principle by which such things ought
                    merely
                    be appropriated to, that our establishment of said principles are comparably based; in that, of
                    certain
                    truths and or insights about the world, whereby the apparent nature of things spurrs the principle
                    we have,
                    so is such knowledge which principles are derived from not full or founded. And at that, as we take
                    for
                    granted the principle in question, and spend our time assessing the subjects fit for it, that so do
                    such
                    principles come in by a similar way; whereby we take for granted the nature of things, and merely
                    assess the
                    principles fit for it. "Yet in that, the ancient waves of tradition hold too mightily a claim. And
                    with much
                    evidence to, for the tug-O-war between values newly established in the 16th century and those
                    developed from
                    establishments in antiquity, mark the trajectory in which governments and cultures have come. Quite
                    unfortunatley, the larger wars within the recent past, seem merely a result of the major powers
                    fending off
                    those whose 'state of living' was born upon the developments of such ancient-modern conflict. In
                    Germany
                    namely."

                    So the nature of things is such, that via observation, both our mind, and its otherwise ambigious
                    counterpart of matter ---and converseley- are but composites of baser things. Such things appear to
                    be
                    nothing more than excitations of basic fields (and or field), which exhibit the properties of
                    particles and
                    forces. For the former, you have up and down Quarsk; two of the former and one of the latter create
                    a
                    positive charge, while one up and two down create a neutral charge. The gluon initates the binding
                    force
                    between the quarks, as to create the charges and charge relation: the body of which (of postive and
                    neutral
                    charges) is the nucleus. Surrounding the nucleus are electrons; and the amount corresponds to the
                    amout of
                    charges in the nucleus. As well, more electrons there are, the further out will they be disperesed
                    from the
                    nucleus: these are valence shells. Via the electromagentic force, the electrons bind to electrons
                    orbiting
                    other nuclei; such a union forms an atomic bond, and at that a molecule. These molecules interact
                    with
                    others, and as pertains to life, so are cells made. A union of cells is termed organism; and within
                    said
                    organism, different kinds of cells joined together is called tissue. In animals, these tissues form
                    organs.
                    And in terms of sense, it is all to clear that what we mean by that, is some sort of impression, and
                    some
                    mysterious response.
                    <br>&emsp;Such an interaction is of a compositie type; in that, of visions case, the light coming in
                    does so

                    field of
                    vision, so are our senses excited in such a way. Our percpetion of such an impression, and in a
                    composite
                    way, is in itself comparable, in that, as the input is but a collection of light-streams, and so as
                    to
                    create proportions, so is our response equally composite, in that of the collected input, so is it
                    harnessed
                    and exhbited (to our perception) in a compositionally assembled way. Cameras serve as an example of
                    this. In
                    their inital form, light would hit a surface, and a firming chemical would be placed as to hold the
                    'more or
                    less relfection, or proportioned glimmer' into the surface. Illustrating this though in depth, there
                    were
                    indiviudals light-streasm that hit particular points on the surface. Upon each point hitting its
                    respective
                    spot, so was the binding agent exhibted to that point, by the piece of such agent as was placed at
                    such
                    point. Our brains potentially differ though, in that of the collective input, that so is this
                    brought in, as
                    if a solidified impression, but therein dispersed to various points of the brain for perception. The
                    question, is whether the collected input is sent as a whole to each point, or if each point which
                    indivudlaly came into the senses, goes to a corresponding point of the brain; by which each
                    brain-point
                    which recvies an according input-point, offers an according point of perception: the total being a
                    composite
                    perception.
                    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the ambiguity comes from the total-view of the sense-appartus. For it is not so
                    true that
                    a left and right point come in, and as a line, are inputed to the processing parts of the brain;
                    whereby the
                    left goes to one recpective point, the right the other. Rather, the actual input-apparatus is a
                    point system
                    itself; so that the left input impressess itself to a certain spot on the appartus, and the right
                    equally.
                    And my feeling, is that each spot on the input-appartus corresponds to a recpective point.
                    <br>&emsp;This feels very Humian, in that, of our composite perception, it is more likely that the
                    experience of perception is but each processed point offering its own pointed perception. The act of
                    processing into perception is one thing, be it whole or composite. But we can say, that whether the
                    inputs
                    are processed and something else is made aware as to call perception, or if the processing brings on
                    the
                    perception more innately, that so if if a left point came in, was processed then perceived as a
                    point, that
                    the adjacent right point being processed does not in fact lead to the perception of a line, but
                    rather the
                    perception of a right point and left one as parallel with one another: yet, per the Humian notion,
                    that only
                    each point is per itself percieved. "And perhaps via the actual means to perception, that the
                    experience of
                    said points being parallel, and at that a line, occurs."
                    <br>&emsp;In other words, that one perceives compositionaly is fucntionally true. But that, of the
                    composition, or seemingly whole object which we normally see, so is the means to that unclear, and
                    at that,
                    unevident that such a unity is actually occuring. "And not a sholl of perceptions of the elements of
                    the
                    composition; leading perhaps to the sense of unity by their being enough elements to actually consit
                    of
                    something composed; yet we are in our ignorance and naievty fooled into thinking that the breadth of
                    compositionla elements are in fact the thing composed." As if one really thought, in terms of
                    tissue, that
                    their body was whole, and not a bundle of cells.
                    <br>&emsp;Though, in all things, it is hard to the baser elements, and at that, affirm the prescence
                    of
                    actual points, as opposed to a whoole. For the truth in that matter, is that compositions of the
                    mental
                    kind, like those atomic, may be but feeatures of an otherwise univseral fabric, who's unaltering
                    ripples
                    create the seeming effects of otherwise seeming elements; only such elements are in fact mere
                    ripples in
                    complete fabric. For otherwise, if there are indeed pieces, then the magnitude of them is unclear.
                    As for
                    substance, so is the source of that in terms of a whole fabric equally unclear. Nor is the source of
                    its
                    ripples, as to compound into via differenation, clear. But in that, the question lies in the
                    movement for
                    something complete and entire, and not so of a vast amount of distinct things. "Who would need some
                    source
                    of motion which brought them into each others company. While the fabric needs only a gust of wind;
                    for in
                    the consquent ripple, so is each seeming strand already strung together."

                    That all being said, it is fair to say that the form of nature is very basic compared to the complex
                    objects
                    apparent to us. And our perception is, arguably, nothing more than an exhibition of such simplcity,
                    but in a
                    peculiar form. For the motions of particles is either a) basic, or b) a feature of baser magnitudes;
                    and
                    thus water is a relatviely complex form, regarding motion. And our mind, as in the complexities of
                    tissues
                    and DNA, are but a equal kind of complexity. The mind is perhaps foremost; but our ignorance and
                    confusion,
                    seems the cause of us thinking that it is something distinct from those other complexities; and at
                    that, per
                    its special form, that by the mystery of how any form is at all, that so is the mind subject to a
                    unique
                    part of said mystery; whereby we attribute some neccessity to the baser motions of things, as if
                    imposed
                    upon; and that the mind is uniquely impposed on, and at that, in relation to the imposition: and its
                    sender.
                    "This comes from the ambiguity of perception, and its seeming governance by us; and from there, it
                    seems
                    like such governance is in line wiht, or tapping into and thus in relation to, the otherly source
                    which
                    imposes itself upon all things; and that perhaps, in imposition that the mind is uniquely subject
                    to, that
                    so is our mind such as to seemingly connect us with the special portion of the general imposition.
                    'Gods
                    heart, rather than the clap of his hands."
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, of the nature of things is thus, than history merely lays as a precedent to
                    our
                    current undertanding of this; and it acts as a sort of disposition which modernity must reorient
                    itself
                    from.
                    <br>&emsp;One of the key principles for man, is that considering the past, that the explanation of
                    change,
                    as has come and will be, as that the evident mistakes of the past were such that, of those holding
                    them,
                    that the evident falsity merely led to incongruety with nature; thus causing more pain than ought be
                    made,
                    and less pleasure than ought be had. And because, generally speaking, our beliefs are esteemed by
                    their
                    output of such, that so was an experience which brought litte something which spurred us to inquire
                    and
                    advance. And the insight I have, is that the resistance to doing so tends to occur when the point of
                    suggestion revovles around beliefs that people are afraid to change; and by that, the content of
                    such
                    beliefs is almost typically in the ways and aims of idoltry. Governance holds similar whims and
                    cares; but
                    the turbelence in that is more than not drawn from the conflicts of devotion. For it is not so hard
                    to say,
                    that of our devotions, that they are not in fact promsiing for anything beyond life; nor are they
                    advantegous to life, 'as nature does not change'. As regars morals, these are commonly argued in
                    favor for
                    devotion due to the collective harmony, and at that ethics within such resolve. Only, the actual
                    contents of
                    the deovtion are not themsevles true; and at that, it seems fairer that an agreement to what was
                    true was
                    the requirment for collective harmony. Indeed the nature of devotion is one of worship and oblige;
                    and one
                    may argue that without the sense of some fatherly and or threatening judge, that people will not act
                    suitably.
                    <br>&emsp;In that sense, histroy lays as a sort of superstition to the divine, and the esteemed
                    qualities
                    which follow; but equally, resits any usefull change via the strict contents of such devotion. I
                    cannot say
                    entirely, but it seems that the point in which man had begun to inquire and ask, that the initial
                    beliefs he
                    had, and at that devotion, barred him from doing so: indeed causing the great war of man.
                    <br>&emsp;From that, I am not convinced that the nature of things has been properly defined; nor has
                    any
                    moral pretense of what is required for man to properly be, been rightly stated. For all the
                    experience one
                    has to suggest such a thing, is born from an age, or eon even, where man has been nothing but
                    devoted. Yet
                    in all the fraility of that, there has not been a point where an devotion to something true has been
                    done;
                    or that he has, in mass community, co-existed withotu devotion. It feels more historic to say, that
                    in mans
                    communion, that upon the core of it being harmonized by devotion, that all war and petulance was
                    born. Now,
                    in the modern age, or approach to it at least, the sentiments of the day are of liberty and
                    discovery: and
                    the riches are so expansive, that even those who we accept will in poverty lay, hold in fact similar
                    riches.
                    "The wilds of Africa, be it in the jungle or Sudan, is barring a complexion of the fortuned world:
                    whereby
                    it, and most others, are becoming developed, at that of the first kind: second even, as reached with
                    a
                    relatively recent and quick pace, would be dispproptialty fine."
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, the contrast to modernity is in the remants of the prior age. Namely, the
                    cultures and
                    custom which centre themselves around the objects of devotion. But the conflict in life has come
                    primarily
                    from those seeking to achieve the goods and utility from living; while their opponents are those
                    stuck in
                    the past cares of divine goods. "But upon mere examinations, you may find much strenght to believe
                    that such
                    goods are made by those who propogate the merrits of devotion, for the sake of moral harmony, but in
                    fact
                    know nothing more than the past experiences of morality as it pertains to devotion --and thus they
                    know no
                    community based upon liberty and natural oblige--- nor do they say, rightfully or not (in their
                    falisty),
                    how such devotions are in fact true, beyond their utility; for the heart of their validity comes
                    from
                    illiterate and 'telephoned' testimony, and the otherwise confirmations as are prejudiced by past
                    falsity, or
                    the pressures from custom to do so."
                    <br>&emsp;In all of this, per the actual world, lies the broken core of Germany: through the world
                    wars at
                    least. For, upon Rome's demise and the Barabarian settlement, the eastern portion of Gaul came under
                    rule of
                    the soon to be Holy Roman Empire: Charlemgane and his father to be exact. By this legacy, the split
                    of
                    Germany and France saw the former as bishoped by the church, and at that, culturally endowed with
                    the
                    contempory notions of the Church. Upon the reformation, Germany was the foremost ruined; as the
                    influences
                    of the surrounding countries, upon the slightest impression in Germany, saw the highest offence: to
                    which
                    the country, in what is known as the thirty years war, lost a third of its population. From there,
                    the
                    powers of England, Spain, Russia and France grew. And indeed, modernity lent its hand equally to all
                    of
                    them, including Germany. But upon the Napolenic and Prussian wars, the country of Germany was
                    hoddled
                    beneath the strenghts of England and France. Upon the Ferdinand asssination, the lines were drawn,
                    and
                    Germany (and its ally in Austria Hungary), lashed out, seeking conquest. They indeed drew allies
                    (into the
                    central powers); while the remaining countries, who's more liberal aim was continue advancing their
                    internal
                    means of propserity, merely unified in order to defend themselves, and at that, cease the threat.
                    England
                    sought no conquest; nor did Russia and France. It was Germany who sought much; and upon their defeat
                    in the
                    first war, the ruins held much motive for a drastic leader to come in; and weilding the prejudices
                    against
                    other cultures and ethnicities --in order to gain power, and rally the public-- so did the
                    holocaust, along
                    with more attempts (and successes) for conlfict ensue. Allied again, the rest of the world --barring
                    Italy
                    and Japan-- dealt with the woes of such tradition. "For upon liberty, which England and France
                    notably
                    embellished, the aim of man was not to overtake and at that supercerde, but to flourish, for
                    utility; the
                    tenant of which held no difference between man other than that of his past. But in the present, in
                    the lands
                    more or less established, would he cooperate, and by his able and relished means, proceed. While the
                    flair
                    of Germany held the ashes of devoted policy and conflict; and despite the falir of liberty that
                    incorporated
                    itself through modern days, compared to the surrounding powers, the roots of Germany prominently
                    lay."

                    say
                    drinks and food. And I have always said no to this; and felt quite incongruous with most people who
                    otherwise would.
                    <br>&emsp;At heart, the principle is one of standard over taste; as not to drink soda despite its
                    flavor,
                    and thus avoid the glycemic overload. Moreover, the good which come's from such refusal, is more
                    than a mere
                    avoidance of pain; for soda does not bring much which is terrible. Rather, it allows for the
                    promulagation
                    of creative and or tender interests and cares; and at that, by avoiding the soda, you also avoid its
                    contrariety to such an experience.
                    <br>&emsp;For none can rightly say that your rigor and accuity holds little effect to your more
                    invovled
                    experience. One who drinks can surely do so and still enjoy the drimking, or the food and lavish
                    converse.
                    But the principle we abide by, is such that all toil is removed from our labor, nor is there any
                    short
                    amount of steadyness through our days. There is little fear, no sickness, no boredom. But our fun
                    then,
                    comes from things we do. And despite the actions invovled with partying, so is there little which is
                    actually done; it's more like a festival, whereby the candor and vibes provide a sort of liveliness
                    and
                    excitment. But when you consider the actual acts you do, its more about taking it in. Our interests
                    are
                    purely in tasks, namely in reading essays and texts, writing more or less constrcutively, but
                    heavily in a
                    reflective and or considerate way; we play games of all sorts, from Witcher, Battleifeld, Ark and
                    Civ; and
                    we sink into shows such as Star Trek and Seinfeld; nor are we beyond the pleasure of long ago
                    videos,
                    'whereby the times and character hold our interest'.
                    <br>&emsp;As a child find's fun in making things, running around, breaking rules, seeking adventure,
                    so as
                    an adult, am I more inclined to heartier experiences. I bear myself upon them with equal luster, but
                    also
                    with the neccessary care and oblige in order to see them. It is not easy to watch a movie you've
                    seen
                    several times before, or a show at that; youtube is like this even moreso. Nor do games grab our
                    attention
                    when there similarly old, or in need of ingenuity and investment. Nor can I write when I've little
                    to say;
                    which almsot entirely comes from curiosity and affirmation; but such is lacking when my interest is
                    dulled,
                    and thus there is no care for inquiry; or I am restless or impassioend, and merely declaring how our
                    fortune's will be.
                    <br>&emsp;I just simply invest myself into an array of books, writers, reflections, films, shows,
                    youtubers
                    and videos, along with various kinds of games, whose discourse and development brings me to relish;
                    and at
                    that, I am fond of nature, in her colors, form and shine; nor does her constancy of such offerings
                    ever
                    dissapoint. And surrounding this, is a relatively effortless mode of being; whereby work is nothing
                    but the
                    smallest employment; nor is our health and reasoning but a fostering of such ease. I am never sick,
                    nor am I
                    in any trembling way tired. I am always walking, listening to music, sitting upright, writing,
                    enjoying,
                    playing.
                    <br>&emsp;And from this experience, I can say, that by chance or complacnency, that I see how
                    certain items
                    impact said experience. Namely, sitting in chairs hankers my ability to sit on the ground; which on
                    principle, and in practice, is akin to eating whole foods or not. Eating sugar begrudges my body, as
                    does
                    eating breakfast weigh me down; nor does the right blend of strenght, stability and restoratvie
                    training
                    treat me to anything more than adaqueate energy and form; while doing the latter brings a solid and
                    tender
                    pace throughout my day. "Where industry, love and time come to bear."
                    <br>&emsp;By my accounnts, the terms richness, splendor, wonder and felicity remark something
                    somewhat
                    broader, firmer and fresher than that of longing, craving, recklessness or elation. These are
                    admittedly
                    peaks which spring higher than the tops of those former; but so do they fall. And at that, such
                    springs are
                    not so constant, considering their nature as shining moments, rather than entire days. "And if so,
                    but
                    seldom, if not passing one offs."
                    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is in a sort of contrast to the common fancies and wishes for comfort
                    and fun;
                    and at that, exotic delight and luster. As such, our course of action, so far as our means are
                    concerned, is
                    so for such ends. And like those who's means are for those funner ends, so do we have our own line
                    to
                    convene with. And as per all lines of oblige, so lies in it potential contrariety: which we will
                    merely
                    define as anything which brings you off the line. "For sin brings you away from the path to God; as
                    does
                    junk and fatigue bring me away from industry and recreation. While the case for comfort and fun, is
                    such
                    that being uneconomical whithers away the extent to which you can afford to enjoy such a state."
                    <br>&emsp;As it stands, I am an incomplete man. For I have the cares and quality which remark the
                    deepest
                    interests. Only, I have little form outside of this; and by the neccessity to exist in such a way,
                    that the
                    required amends make me anxious. It is not from the work demanded, but the association with other
                    people.
                    "For it seems that upon their work being done, that they go to the bar, or somewhere fun; and upon
                    asking
                    me, I have no recourse but to agree, or for some reason say know. I tend to just say no, and let
                    life go on.
                    And indeed existing this way is fine; as not all are in such cahoots; nor are we so aversr to all
                    matters.
                    But it is hard to enter a new enivronment, and only therein mingle; whereby you don't convene beyond
                    that."
                    <br>&emsp;Ultimtaely, what it comes down to is that I am tensely disposed to the goodness of a day,
                    and at
                    that our life. As one innately knows that college affords credit, and thus means to money, so do I,
                    in what
                    a good life seems to me, in being wide and plenty of rich and flourishing activity, know that what
                    affords
                    this is your health and care. For in one, you mould the furnace which burns the coals for all your
                    active
                    attention; and the other, faciliates the skill and familiarity to be both drawn and able within said
                    tasks.
                    <br>&emsp;We have learned that there are things beyond this. As food is but an adjacent element to
                    our
                    crafts, so are itineraries, trades and friendship equally around. And despite some of this being
                    harder to
                    find, and at that properly align, so are some accessible. Admittedly, they may require you to sit in
                    a
                    chair, or pay a small fee. But so is the worth of such things sufficeint. And at that, the value of
                    such
                    things is not comprasmied but the things itself. Eating out costs money; and although working for so
                    much
                    disposable income is not ideal, so is it permissible in its own right; but for 'eating out', so is
                    this a
                    fatiguing use of such means. By that, going to church or temple requires you to sit down, listen,
                    communicate, and at that, be upright while public and social; but the ends are one whereby the
                    instruments
                    of such task are exercised, yielding us a little recovery from our private state. Plus, the advent
                    of an
                    occasion brings structure to your day; which irons out the neccessary appointments of work. As well,
                    by
                    exercsing those faculties, and being somewhat invovled, so do you hold more ground compared to other
                    possible relations or scenarios; which brings more ease towards those, as you are not so eager or
                    bashfull.
                    "And thus, the cost being time, there holds no concern from me; while sitting, and at that begging
                    the
                    question of our principle, so may we be discrete, or confident as per the norm: which all in all,
                    makes for
                    a small price compared to the good received."

                    In our heart, we know a mistake has been made. For we left our home, our stbaility, maybe even a
                    friend. Of
                    that latter I hold no remorse, for how would I know; nor would it be but a vain experience amidst
                    our
                    attempt for truth. "And, admittedly, I saw little which remark much relation to to truth we then
                    glemead."
                    <br>&emsp;But now, having lived on for so long, all we've done is accumulate wellness to our living.
                    Yet our
                    position is such, that such living is held onto to much; and thus any return to stability is one
                    that is all
                    to apprehnesive. This is so though, for we are so ill-grounded outside our families offer and
                    fortune. Yet,
                    we know we must go; and thus, in leaving, we have left ourselve bare to such a return.
                    <br>&emsp;For I never wish to do much more than the freedom given by my parent's provides. It is an
                    odd
                    scenario, as our simplicity and respect propagate our tenancy. But so is such a stay strictly
                    limited. For
                    my parents wish well for me, and at that, hold a fair discipline to our ultimate task of being
                    ourself in a
                    unprivate way.
                    <br>&emsp;We are so private, for the procurring of such ways was done in contrast to the ordinary
                    path; and
                    at that, our cares and congruency fell short of the affairs of such path. And in that, we found a
                    relative
                    amount of joy, that being at home, 'as it was then esteemed', felt like the concillary action. But
                    time went
                    on, and we were asked for more; and perhaps fairly so.
                    <br>&emsp;I can't say whether the merrits of pushing me out there is well-based. But I can say, that
                    in my
                    heart, I at least know that it is not to our benefit or comfort to be as we are. And of such view, I
                    accept
                    it without concern, for of such matters which would better surround me, so are these not contrary to
                    our
                    dearer cares.
                    <br>&emsp;For the truth in the matter is that upon the cultivation of such cares, we disposed
                    ourselves so
                    heavily that obliging ourselves to dutiful affairs felt like a defecit; in both the toil and time.
                    Now, our
                    cares are not with much luster, but our harmony with such labors and their offer of autonomy and
                    invovlment,
                    is not but smooth and consistent. But as it were, we have come from a time, centered perhaps on the
                    divergence from what our entire yuoth built towards; and thus, in all our ripe cultivation and
                    awkward
                    stubborness, we have cornered ourselve as to be so far out of outward connection, that finding any,
                    be it
                    demanded or sought, is so relatively stark, and thus a prompter for paranoi and reservation. "And as
                    such,
                    our contrivances run amuch, and at that over indulge in perfect scenarios, as to accomdaote our
                    weariness."

                    I want limber shoulders; those which don't bear down on me, nor lug unevenly. To accomplish this, I
                    ought
                    primarily do dowanrd and upward facing dog. I also seek a solid core, as to hilt my shoulders, and
                    at that,
                    be secure while seated. To do this, I ought remain active, along with doing leg raises and lunges.
                    <br>&emsp;I seek good friends, but per interest. I play Diablo, Ark and some shooters; we'll play
                    together.
                    I do wish for a girlfirend, but only if I like her and she likes me. Our naieve optimism that our
                    irrelevant
                    merrit will procure some sort awe upon me is not right. Nor should we hope for something which is
                    not
                    realistic. "Our view on such things should not be but 'furgal' amidst a supposed exoticness."
                    <br>&emsp;At that, from work I find commradery with peers; along with some commune with distant
                    associates
                    and nearby customers. My name is Ryan, we love films, gaming, writing, youtube discoure on such
                    things. I am
                    seeking future professions as an online worker. Right now, I have helped my parents move, and am
                    looking to
                    work part time.
                    <br>&emsp;The most important thing to me is flow. So I work shorter shifts, nearby, and nicely,
                    while at
                    home, in order to accumulate future rents; all while the meadows warm up, and the mountains afford
                    nicer
                    spots to see them. While doing so, our in between time is spent playing Diablo, Ark or Civ; all
                    while we
                    read at parks, having walked or ridden. We eat brussel sprouts, the freshest oranges, the greatest
                    soups,
                    and the fairest breads.
                    <br>&emsp;In life, I am obliged to regard the future with our likely family. As are such partners
                    requiring
                    of me to bloom with integrity; so that our true wisdom is not hidden or afraid. I fear no obscurity,
                    nor
                    does the world's path alarm me; nor are we ignorant on the tracks of it; the former motion being one
                    of
                    ultiamte and peacefull insight; the latter one of understanding, and at that humility to further
                    understanding we lack, 'whereby the points of potential threat are being attended to in droves'.
                    <br>&emsp;I simply wish to express myself. And instead of doing so in the overt contrasts to
                    responsibility,
                    or dreaming like a child, or from bravado, I rather harness what good health and care brings us;
                    whereby the
                    work from our eyes and hands bring me to a rich and hearty cheer. This needs little possession.
                    Instead, it
                    requires the little which our provision is staked on. At that, those exotic and or hampered delights
                    are
                    overlooked as passions swirling from our unable means to an otherwise dear expression. And so I sit
                    in such
                    inability without dreams, but rather communcate, to those I depend on, or those who agree to exhanve
                    work
                    for provision, as to be stably thus, and therefore commenmurative to our aim.

                    So two things are on my minde, namely that of work, and making friends/relations.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, I think our need is quite tame, and at that, can settle on the point we care for.
                    Let
                    yourself be oriented, say hello to those who you were acquainted with; learn the names of those who
                    your
                    not. Remark your situation if it comes up; focus yourself, and at that situate yourself, by learning
                    more
                    about the various jobs. Find a way to talk about games, be it Cod or diablo, star wars, House of the
                    dragon.
                    And all in all, seek little which you at heart care not for, or are not right to, and be merrily
                    cheerful,
                    friendly, hard working and ethical. You can show up, say good morning, rest between the 2nd and
                    third hour,
                    then say that you are leaving. And honestly, my interest is such, as to faciliate our means of
                    living; or at
                    leas the comfort in doing so now. Also, having funds for our PC, future moves is appealling. As is
                    the
                    general free time amidst our stability to play Civ and scooter to the fields and read. We like
                    ambient music
                    because it makes me relax and into a flow; in particular, I like film scores or soundtracks; though,
                    if I
                    did like normal music, it would be soft rock, ie. chili peppers. I'm really into yoga, and eating
                    heartily.
                    I am not a vegan, but I tend to eat in such manner. Ask people their names, where their from, if
                    their ready
                    for the holidays, if their taking advantage of Black Friday, for VR, new computer, tv --considering
                    how
                    cheap they are. In total, the smooth pace of the holidays makes for a rather clean and comfy
                    ambivolence;
                    for bot our home and active life, mixed with work. "And to be fair, I never felt off while at that
                    job, nor
                    much while on Mariner. It was only so, when we yearned towards, and acted on our expectation of
                    interest by
                    another. I don't think so in any literal way, but I do consider whether such remarks by me made
                    Holly,
                    Nicole or Bailey feel like I'd harrassed them. If I did, I hope they'd forgive me, and know that I
                    only
                    meant it with a plain heart. And much of our forwardness was from our kind indifference, as to
                    merely share
                    that I felt that way. But we have learned that such feelings were not brought on because they, or me
                    truly,
                    liked them; but rather that I thought they did, and felt like I was oppertune to do so. Now it feels
                    like,
                    whether we need it or not, or at least if we can wait, that so is the question and at that interest,
                    care,
                    approach or regard for someone angled little on our heart fluttering or the apprhensive mystery of
                    whether
                    or not they share my feeling. For in truth, you should already know, for you have spoken to them,
                    and they
                    you. Try chatting, skyping, going for a walk or playing games. Just see if there's something for you
                    to do.
                    That is what a relationship should form around. And so a) if that core isn't there, then you need
                    not
                    pressure yourself, to make her feel uncomfortable, by being motivated and elated by mere repor, as
                    to usher
                    said relation; and b) if such thing isn't prescence, then let your hinderance or nerves come from an
                    inner
                    confusion, that there are such flutterings, but ill-placed considering your less than wholesome view
                    (or
                    intent); and thus, you need not linger or embrace, but be; and if that means you are not with
                    another, so be
                    it; better to be ourselves, free, ready and steady through acquaintence and familiarity, than fixate
                    our
                    impassioned breathe on some envied, begrieved, self assured and or ashamed feeling."
                    <br>&emsp;That being said, I can see that spring holds a dream, whereby the woods and bees of Pitt
                    Meadows
                    open up, and mellow me into a cheery state. As such, less we are asked to quickly leave, then so may
                    we stay
                    for the warmer months. That being so, whether not we get the job now or later is not essential. I
                    reckon
                    that the holidays are a great way to meet people in an occupied state, and at that, build a point of
                    friendly relations. I only seek part time, and thus, our meager ask (for Dev) need accordingly
                    oblige. If
                    that is not available, or the time isn't right, then we'll wait, and hopefully get hired prior to
                    winter. So
                    let's just phone, say that we've returned to Pitt and were looking to come back to PCX. Were a solid
                    80-90
                    uph ---with a bit of resharpening-- and that we wish to learn more about fill rates and 'department
                    boons'.
                    That, and while were there, ought we draw on such elements for our reflections --as we might do upon
                    moving,
                    or anything of the sort--- along with seeking proper conduct and ability within different tasks:
                    notably the
                    register and phone. "I just want to be more involved and able, as to feel more drawn and with care
                    as to
                    time and producitivity. And we have our own personal adendum, to speak clearly, ask and share about
                    youtube,
                    movies, tech, holidays and games. Ask even whether or not someone is from Pitt. Someone even who
                    seem's
                    another ethnicity, ask them where their from; and whether there is alot to be said, you can end with
                    'and do
                    you like Canada, lower mainland, or Pitt Meadows'; for you can share your own feelings too."

                    I am not a scientist in any meaningfull way. I may test my insights, but for now, I merely wish to
                    cultivate
                    the hyposethis which I'd then test.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, what I seek are methods and or principles for inquiry. Namely, is that our mind
                    is to be
                    deemed as something analagous to the derived motions of planets; or that in life, that these are but
                    motions
                    of equally derived objects, but whose motions are best described by 'water dripping down snow,
                    whereby the
                    force of one propells it through certain trajectoriees by the friction of the substance'. Moreover,
                    we have
                    a Humian principle, whereby the recognition of our senses is but an equally derived thing; and just
                    as the
                    actual sense is but a union of finer motions, so is are regard a union of finer perceptions.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, we can remove our mind as being some distinct object which the mystery of
                    nature has
                    produced.
                    <br>&emsp;From there, we can merely sit on the two main questions; namely that of esscence, in both
                    substance and magnitute; along with distribution, as to see, how beyond an entities impetus, how it
                    actually
                    bore relation to others to create the complexities we see today.
                    <br>&emsp;This is better explained as a pairing of compliments, in both the inquiry needed to
                    discern the
                    base esscence; but then the science, and or investigation, as to see a) what are we anlaysising, ie,
                    what is
                    the form by some method made, and b) what is said form?
                    <br>&emsp;This latter portion is perhaps the truest question. For it is one thing to say, how did
                    the
                    planets come together: and you say through the sun's infant debris. But upon primordial unity, the
                    question
                    then reaches a basic form; as to how such unity is possible --or differentation at least as to
                    procurr
                    complexity within a soul, yet rippling fabric.
                    <br>&emsp;But such possibilty is not itself the question; at least, of that and how something
                    complex came
                    to be, so are these but the ontology and law, as to make results (or unity, as observed and
                    descibred) able.
                    Rather, the question, is of that ability through ontology, and to the laws we see --ie, the evident
                    unities-- so are we looking at the means to the design of such ends. Or in other words, that unity
                    could
                    occur, why did it occur in the manner that it did? Why weren't other laws or unities created? Is it
                    perhaps
                    possible that the prescence of being at all is exlusively unique, and at that bound to the results
                    we see?
                    Could the results now seen been apart of a basis which would produce nothing else? Or better put,
                    could be
                    there be any basis which did not produce what we see? And at that, ought we consider whether there
                    are many
                    basis', if not potentially?
                    <br>&emsp;For the true test of a base theory, is not that any literary understanding of being is
                    exlaimed,
                    nor the deepest laws understood; but rather, one must understand how complexions made by the former
                    and
                    generalizes into the latter, came to be. For you are otherwise left with a fair idea of how being
                    could be
                    at all, but know causal effect as to the evidence we seek to explain. "And indeed, much confusion
                    and
                    contraiety lies in this isse: whereby you suppose the basis' conduct as to reach the evident end; or
                    to work
                    back from said evidence to reach either a) a similar basis, but with with properties that are
                    understood via
                    analysis, or b) an understanding which is more akin to our causal view that cells are made of
                    molecules
                    which are made of atoms, which are bundles of particles bound by forces; and that these, may be
                    composed of
                    something equally definitive, but basic, or something deeper at least --of which may be made of
                    something
                    baser as well."
                    <br>&emsp;In fact, beyond the ostenstive principles we use to simplify the world we seek to explain,
                    so may
                    we use a crowned piece of evidence to better determine the 'grooved and or complex principle' we
                    also seek
                    to explain. Namely, that in the Cosmic Microwave background, you have distributions of 'lumops'; and
                    that
                    these are deemed to be the marks of anistropy in the universe; and at that, the points which would
                    draw more
                    matter (due to graviation), as to produce the massive clumps of matter which galaxies are. Alongside
                    that,
                    is the notion of dark matter, which is proposed to be the source of such anistropies, 'as if such
                    points
                    remarked dark matter wells, but which dissproportionate amounts of matter would fall into'.
                    <br>&emsp;Now, the question for all eternity, is why there is such non-uniformity? This indeed is
                    why we
                    remark that the baser esscence of things is not merely remarked by substance and motion, but
                    magnitude, as
                    to reflect the results which seem caused by a less than unifrom motion. At that, we can say that of
                    the
                    cause of CBM distributions, that these may be merely parts of a prior chain. But the question
                    seemingly, be
                    it inquired of in terms of baser magnitudes, or through analysis, as to see, how galaxies for
                    instance are
                    in fact in their wholeness, distributed by such CBM wells, is to how such anistropies were formed.
                    And,
                    foremost, to the form they took. For it is one thing to state that there are anistropies; just as
                    there is
                    fairness to say that the universe on the whole, seems homogenous. But of such homogenuity, so is it
                    only so
                    on a broad scale; where in fact, each element is where it is by a precise output of the function
                    which
                    causes non-uniformity. "For everything would be complete, soul, and at that featureless. Which in
                    terms of
                    the earliest things may be so; but so is everything we now see, in all its complexitites, a seeming
                    result
                    of some prior anisotropy. Meaning there was something which produced the features we now see."
                    <br>&emsp;In short, the definitive principles regarding evidence make the investagtive principles
                    approahcbale; for we need not regard any output as special. But said principles are not easy to
                    declare; if
                    only because we have too little to state regarding the cause of the particlar complexities, as
                    opposed to
                    there being complexity at all.

                    All I seek is permission to express myself. My ignorance and adolescence barrs me from the sights
                    and or
                    resolve to public affairs. "But we are alike most peopple in that way." In any case, we prioritze
                    our family
                    and attendances; and derive a warm and stable liberty from there. "Or better put, such things direct
                    my
                    duties; to which our amends yields the treats of success." Again, we are perhaps privilaged to
                    regard our
                    'deeds' as such, and not look to the affairs of others. "But such is the times; in that of our

                    <br>&emsp;In this though, as the care for what is near and dear, so lies the battle to support
                    oneself,

                    there
                    unpossessed state is drawn to things which promise some movement outside their idle station.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, our own care for such principle is such, that finding stability is not so hard;
                    if at all
                    but the easiest amends to a slice of normal things. But thereby runs the frozen sentiment of our
                    unacquiring
                    progress; and the, albeit admittedly youthfull, feeling of being stuck in your stability, with no
                    room to
                    use it, 'nor any sight of developing it'. This is for me though, and indeed our growing years have
                    shown
                    little which is required that can't be mended to easily.
                    <br>&emsp;But I think that our remarks here are bound by a sentiment of the past, whereby all these
                    'stable
                    and or impassioned' matters, were measured up against the amount of princiuple good I could afford.
                    And by
                    that, I can see clearly that the last peg of such regard, lies in an understadning of the world; as
                    if, upon
                    our balance between deep and common pleasure, that so would the truth of the world commend the
                    former. Even
                    now, the balance is not much of a comrpamise, but an acceptence of remission from the passions built
                    up till
                    this point, and the practical trimmings of our excessive free time in order to secure that which is
                    left,
                    and nourish that deeper good

                    It seems that such and such or so and so is not as fruitful an approach to take in the beauty of the
                    world.
                    For you make things landmarked, and at that icons; to the effect that their specialness is all you

                    <br>&emsp;So the west coast of America holds a mountain line, named the corrilera. The upper west
                    portion is
                    the pacific. Within that, lays the coast mountains and columbia mountains. Of the former, so runs
                    the
                    Pacific Range into the lower mainlaind, followed by the Cascade range, going from Mount Baker
                    through
                    Washington. In the south of the Pacific Ranges, there splits the North Shore and Garibalid ranges.

                    So we are doing well, but ought not let our interests cloud our respect. Namely, making sure that
                    the
                    airfryer is properly placed while you leave it to cook; and similarly so for toaster and stove top.
                    We can
                    put dishes away without drying; doing so will mitigate the bulk of discontent. Paying some attention
                    to our
                    shoes, as not to walk unnecceasrily inside --particulary when their wet and dirty.
                    <br>&emsp;Otherwise, we've just gone to the store. We got margaine, shoe string fries, butter
                    popcorn, dnese
                    whole wheat bagels, 2 mackarel, diced tomatoes, olive oil, 2 double tofus, no banaans, and some
                    gyozas
                    (which we had). There are several apples and oranges, a big thing of soup, a serving of rice, a full
                    bowl of
                    lentils, and some kale.

                    By some geological means, the earth formed, and upon its clumping, formed tectonic plates; whose
                    dense form
                    slid above the viscous matter below; this formed the continents, and at that, upon collision,

                    <br>&emsp;In the pacfic, there is a notable ring of fire, lining all the east coast of China and
                    Indonesia,
                    through all the Americas. In the northeast, lies the American Cordillera, which is more or less
                    composed of
                    the northwestern Pacfic Ranges, the Cascades and Sierra Nevada which run from the Fraser Valley down
                    through
                    Mexico.
                    <br>&emsp;In the Pacific Range lies the Coast Moutains, which run along the coastal borders of
                    British
                    Columbia. In the southern portion, you have the Garibaldi range, which runs from Pemberton to Golden
                    Ears,
                    the North Shore range, which splis off of that to the west, and holds Moutain Cyprus, Grouse and
                    Seymour
                    --to Indian Arm. East of Garibali sits the Douglas range, seperating from the former by Stave Lake,
                    and
                    ending at Harrison. East of Harrison lies the Lilloet range, which lines the Fraser river to the
                    west
                    --which itself runs west of the interior plateau to the Columbia Mountains.

                    So our localle is quite rich in plenty. It is not perfect though, like most locations.
                    <br>&emsp;To begin, the 193 walk (north) is a run away hit, for it is so easy to take that path and
                    come
                    back up 192, or keep going to the park. At night, you can do the standard 193, or add to it
                    naturally. You
                    can also go south of 193, then turn around before you reach the round about. This road is not very
                    busy; and
                    everything is obscured by trees or backyards in this lower part.
                    <br>&emsp;Scattered all around are little routes to walk. At our intersection there are a set of
                    townhomes
                    which runs you to harris; and right there is a crosswalk to go to the rec center or town park.
                    "Which is
                    itself a fair place to sit and read." Besides that, you have Ford road, the back lane, or the curve
                    at 193,
                    each bridging Harris and 193. Further than that, lies the town hall area, the back road of the
                    Coachmem and
                    Hoffman park. There is a big loop from lower 193 and Blakely, with two long dead end streets on the
                    latter.
                    Going through the school is a bust during the day, though evenings and weekends you can add to 120
                    by
                    looping through there, or going up Bonson.
                    <br>&emsp;The main attraction though is scootering. In this regard, the town has welcomed me with
                    renovated
                    arms. From Pitt, you go down the stairs, and have a paved path which continues down the back of Pitt
                    Athletic, coming out onto lower Airport way; or you can turn right, and take the path to Harris.
                    That
                    airport path takes you to the long road, which has a stretch of dike which connects with the end of
                    the
                    airport; or you can turn back to go up the dike to Bonson's Landing --or take the forest route. The
                    long
                    road has a mid point which takes you through the woods to Harris, or brings you to Hammond or 119.
                    There is
                    also a path which connects lower Hammond to the lower Airport way. And from there you can enter the
                    Hammond
                    region, or take Hammond road up to 203rd.
                    <br>&emsp;We have learned that the moutains of the north are really the souther tips of the Pacific
                    Range;
                    and bordering those on the southeast portion of the Fraser Valley are the Cascades --with Mount
                    Baker and
                    Saint Helens layed prominently in the north. The Pacific Range holds all our familiar mountains
                    within sub
                    ranges. Cyprus, Grouse and Seymour are of the North Shore range, bordering the Gariboldi Range which
                    Burker
                    and Golden Ears are apart of --they are divided by Indian Arm. East of Golden Ears lies Stave Lake,
                    which
                    acts as a border between the Douglas Range; which extends to Harris Lake. From there, between
                    Harris, lies
                    the Lillolet range, which extends to the Fraser River, and all the way up to the eastern portion of
                    Pemberton.
                    <br>&emsp;Looking Eastward, you have Golden Ears; the left point being the Golden Ear, the right
                    being Edge
                    Peak, and the little bump right of that being Blandshand Peak, or the needle. The valley between
                    this holds
                    Alouette lake, and to east side of the said valley is summited by Mount Crikmer. To the east of that
                    lies
                    Stave Lake and the border between the Gariboldi and Douglas Range. Also, from the meadows we live,
                    there
                    lies a small hill in the distance. This is Thornhill, and holds at its base SRT, Albion and 240th.
                    <br>&emsp;The grand daddy of this thinking though, is to views. For clouds, the moon, color in
                    general,
                    finds its greatest strid over distance. And indeed we are privalaged to be near many bountiful
                    spots. But as
                    one who has many allergies cannot fully enjoy a menu, so does our limitation via terrain, or time of
                    day
                    even, lower the vantage points of interest. For we must see the North Shore Mountains, and those of
                    the
                    central range. Too, Mt Crimpken and Thornhill, being quite prominent to our eastern eye, are but the
                    northern portion of the further ranges; namely that of Mt Sumas, Mt Baker, and the far off Cascades.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, there are many known spots which offer according views. Pitt Athletic offers a
                    fairly
                    detailed eastern view; and near the back of it, you get a fairly nice and rounded view of the
                    northern
                    mountains. It is almost entirely flat though, so sitting is limited. Near the foot of Airport road,
                    sits a
                    dike which runs to the Pitt river. Seeing as it is a dike, there is an inherent lip for you to sit
                    on. And
                    although the far West of the North Shore is harder to see, you get a very drawn back view of the
                    eastern
                    portion and all of the central range. I don't believe you get such a good view of the east; but even
                    the
                    east portion of the central range can be seen. In order to see Baker and the Cascades, you need to
                    be either
                    high up, or on the back of a western front. Ford Road is the main culprit, near the farm path. There
                    are
                    also northern portions that may offer isolated spaces as to see further east, or at least be closer
                    to see
                    the central portion. Up Ford Road you can turn right onto Mctavish and go to a potential spot; or
                    you can go
                    a little up Harris and turn down a farm path --which is quite isolated if I remember. You may be
                    able to see
                    Baker, but I do not know. You can turn left on Old Dewdney onto Hale road, and sit by its own lip.

                    So I'm feeling a bit of nerves. Thankfully it has little to do with any meaningfull result, but
                    rather our
                    acquaintece with the initial steps.
                    <br>&emsp;As we accept our place towards Superstore and remaining in Pitt, I feel these neighbourly
                    eyes of
                    pity, 'as if their saying what am I doing?'. And although the memory of our place at Superstore is
                    not so
                    begrieving, so are we going to have to meet new people, and acquaint ourselves with a newer team.
                    And it is
                    hard to be the new person.
                    <br>&emsp;Thinking back, our initial spot at that moment was one of excitment; and like other
                    moments,
                    confidence in our expressive receptivity. But time goes on, and people go their way; and our less
                    than
                    forthright personality does not draw them in. We merely become familiar. And I recal some concerns
                    about
                    slips of the tongue, grumbling, or alliterating anything elegant. "Its the sort of feeling you get
                    when so
                    share something with someone you like; for you sort of have to announce yourself with the kind
                    expression;
                    as to offer them something, all the while they hear you; as opposed to them alreaddy being
                    listening. And
                    indeed, this remarks our romantic sentiment, in that, if someone would not expect it, then your
                    off."
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, were here in Pitt and the lands are beautiful. Our Dad is watching some News,
                    and all
                    I can say is that our misgivings lie from an obsecure snese of principle; be it local, distrcit
                    wise,
                    regional, or continental. And at that, I overt nyself from such sentiments because deep down, I knwo
                    there
                    is something more for me to do; at least there is something about the world which proceeds on, and
                    not in
                    full harmony; to which our own actions being self regarded, and at that for our family and
                    committment,
                    feels almost momentoulsy distant. And so I like to hear little of how the momentum around us. We do
                    indeed,
                    upon this begrudement, learn about the general behavior of the world, as not to be so seperate from
                    something were ignorant towards.

                    <br>&emsp;But when I hear such elation about civic things, I go limbic. For whichever reason, our
                    choices in
                    life correspond to principles as regard such civics; and hearing them speak that way makes me feel
                    irrate
                    and vulnerable. For we do not revere what is being said; nor are we lacking scrutiny of it.
                    <br>&emsp;But I realize that most of whats said is from some group; and that who receives it is
                    either a
                    group of a similar kind, or a smaller group, as in part of a community, a social group, a family
                    even. And
                    so not much can be held by there saying things in ways that remark little of our principle. "Perhaps
                    it is
                    stability that we lack, in order to be with someone who holds such imperative to my life; that there
                    consumption of such 'off putting things' begrieves us only because we are so subject to them. But
                    having
                    some stability will hopefully relieve us from that frightened reaaction. Perhaps are other
                    mischevities will
                    loose their abrassive glare: for we don't mind being so off. Nor will our occupaiton leave as much
                    room or
                    attention to hear what would otherwise be irritable. And our sensitivity to whatever does, seems a
                    boon for
                    our stability."

                    So our training could use some decleration.
                    <br>&emsp;As I see it, the prosperous course is one which mixes definition and progress. By that, I
                    mean not
                    to hold too much weight to Pull ups, but doing so in our sprouting health seems fair. Only, as in
                    all
                    wearing motions, so does this require time for rest and habilitation; namely in your arms, legs, and
                    general
                    rest to boot.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, I see how pushups are paired naturally with running, as do pull ups fit
                    nicely. For
                    each, two sets is our grade; and more or less, doing 3-4 for pulling, and 6-7 for pushups seems fair
                    in our
                    rudimentary state. I would love to reach 8-10 for the latter and 5 for the former.
                    <br>&emsp;Seeing as runs limit the rounds in which we do such motions, we can say, that upon being
                    paired
                    with less demanding runs, or souly concentrated, that beyond reps we'd also wish to hold means to
                    sets. So
                    if we did mere spots, or did 3-4 runs, then we'd also be able to do so with pushups at least; and
                    let
                    pullups build there strenght as to increase within sessions holding their emphasis.
                    <br>&emsp;As for stability, I see much reason to believe that our whole body will be even and swell
                    if our
                    strenght motions are paired with asanas; and in doing so, our shoulders and hips will be level and
                    ampple,
                    and at that, bear little upon our core. It is hard to say if the core should be focused on; as doing
                    so in
                    this early stage feels more grinding then enriching. But I can say, that in tending to our
                    pushup/pullups
                    and pairing this with downard and updward dog, that so will the rigor of our body hold us up
                    naturally. And
                    from there, limber action will be done in those heartier motions, and at that, maintain our strenght
                    while
                    allowing for lunges and core to come about. I'd say in general, that doing Sun Salutaions is a baser
                    good
                    you can partake in; perhaps some leg raise if you have the care. But splitting your accessory focus
                    from
                    that to cow legs and eagle arms sees the best novice approach.

                    One's remarks about things tends to be a little awry when they are of a vagabond type. For stability
                    being
                    what we seek, so may we relish the amount we have as given by those were housed by; but then upon
                    leave, be
                    in a relatively unstable place; as our vagrancy was not so much out of need, but choice.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, our principle of vagrancy comes by our principle of simplcity; so that our
                    dependance
                    does not merely satiate us, but bear means to flourish.
                    <br>&emsp;What I've learned over the years is that dependance is not the means to such flourishing;
                    but that
                    having such a meager satiety has its advantage.
                    <br>&emsp;Now, that we are more or less seeking a return to our own provisision, that so is our
                    place in
                    dependance one that is at a minmum beneficial, in that if we work as though we were providing, then
                    we can
                    accrue resources.
                    <br>&emsp;In this though, I feel a little exposed; as if upon our plea to work, we feel entirely
                    absent from
                    anything of the sort. That, and there is still a perpendicular parallel from those we depend on, as
                    regards
                    the pressure for such provision, and at that, our leniancy for preference.
                    <br>&emsp;For I don't admitt any shortcoming to our self made stability. I also have no qualms about
                    recieving provisions; nor am I confused as to their periodic retreats. What I do remark though, is
                    that each
                    state holds a certain posture, and at that suitable conduct. While we are working, while being
                    provided,
                    then we are merely saving; and by that, so long as we are employed, than our promise should be
                    sufficient
                    for those housing us.
                    <br>&emsp;I only fret then, for not even in our own stabilities, would I hanker over much more than
                    would
                    provide it. And by that, much preference accrues. Now, it seems that our preference needs
                    management, as the
                    ideals we sought must be balanced in order to partake in the full side of things. For I do prefer a
                    robust
                    task, mingled with strangers and co-workers. And at that, a little work, be it longer per bout,
                    seems
                    proficient in gaining us a completion of our equitable task.
                    <br>&emsp;But what if we don't get it? I would like to say, that our qualifications for attemptiong
                    such
                    savings is brought by our choice to remain where we are; and by that, a temporary dealy in the post
                    we seek,
                    by my standard, is alright to in time reach. "For accruding 7 thousand dollars is not much better
                    than 10
                    thousand. For if we had 5, then we could go where we want, and buffer ourselves to get any job, with
                    room
                    for delay."
                    <br>&emsp;At that, I would remark upon our opperunities that our want and final confidence is not
                    refelcted
                    in the character of the actaul interest. "For such folk have their own cares and custom in mind." I
                    will be
                    dissapointed if we are not hired; and at that able to work through the holidays. Nor will it be easy
                    to find
                    something else to do. Though Amazon seems promising.
                    <br>&emsp;Ultimately, you did well; and so well, that we were not keen to hear any recited and or
                    trivial
                    interest. We spoke wonderfully, and showed ourselves to be a good man. I have also confirmed a
                    certain point
                    where perhaps I dragged on to long, and unclearly. But I may not be picked. If we are though, 2 8
                    hour
                    shifts, despite being worse than 3 five, is still fine, and in fact, levels out in terms of a
                    working state.
                    For having so many days off makes the longer shifts more manageble. And indeed, our life here in
                    Pitt
                    Meadows is not such, as to foster this far off interest to go where we could not otherwise. Once and
                    a while
                    maybe; and so may our fortunes and habitation prevail. But really, I wish to accrue some funds while
                    were
                    here in this free and lovely home; and use our scooter to travel and harness the nearby land. Nor is
                    some
                    evening travel via transit a far off means. And by that, there just isn't a real problem working a
                    longer
                    shift; for range of motion is all you need, and stability further warranted. Music will become
                    paramount,
                    and at that inspired. As will our future be set, and our interests and fixes be accessible.
                    <br>&emsp;"And by that, perhaps Amazon will treat the same. Or maybe we look online; for in the
                    moment, I
                    just need to satisfiy the principle of our tenants, as to be permitted to stay; and, in which we
                    both agree,
                    benefit from such point." For I like Pitt Meadows, and the days ahead are stable and kind; and into
                    the
                    bloom and spring, theres not but what a mere scooter fix could not shower me wholly.
                    <br>&emsp;Dev said an email will be sent if we are choosen. We may get one regardless; and he said
                    that such
                    will be in a few days. It being monday, I would not remark anything for today, tomorrow, Wedensday.
                    Thursday
                    perhaps we'll check in; for at that point, we may have been passed, or at the moment of recieving.
                    But there
                    ought be little fear or deduction as to any moment prior to that; for it means likely nothing; nor
                    would it
                    be patient and calm of you to do anything then. So wait. Relax, enjoy. He said things look well; and
                    beyond
                    any pretense or consideration of his which we are not privy to, I think we did great, and were
                    received as
                    well. And we'll go from there otherwise; to work, which was alright mind you; or to some other
                    place. Or
                    we'll wait. For getting hired in January is fine considering our leave 6 months from then.

                    It seems that pain is but a reoccuring event in our lives. Yet, in moments of pleasure, or spans at
                    least,
                    so do we forget; and at that, priotizie such pleasures and the expense of future pain.
                    <br>&emsp;There is a lesson though, namely in your constitution as a being; and by that, akin to

                    <br>&emsp;By that, I can say that remarking our learned and or forseen troubles is the right thing
                    to do.

                    <br>&emsp;The moral of this though, is not that dredd should be our proper response: as if the

                    challenges ahead warranted such. Instead, as we would break iron to reach gold, consider your
                    abilities
                    spent on things of such neccessity. And from there, earn the stability to be, as though you were
                    unburdened.
                    For it is one thing to forgo breathing, and by that, cease to live; and another, to oblige the
                    requisites
                    for home and bread; but thereby, over time, develop the character and composure as to accomdate
                    stresses,
                    appreciate what's nice; and at that, lower the actual weight of the incoming trouble, via wisdom and
                    skill,
                    and otherwise raising the good you receive, via commisery and time's fortune.

                    To note then, we have learned that the ultimate requirment of satiety, is one that ought be truly
                    adhered
                    to. For this indeed is the poster child for, 'I am fine now, and oh well, we'll deal with that
                    later'. So
                    that even in stable positions, we abandon them for pleasure; but then upon our encumbant return, so
                    are we
                    with little, and at that, forced to reorient ourselves; which drags down any current pleasure, and
                    at that,
                    invivtes much pain from the novel prescence of responsibility. "Life is like a spearhead, and one
                    ought
                    always be in line with the thrust of it; for never in their privalage will they hold so forever;
                    nor, in
                    their fortunes, will time offer much or demand less. For the joy in things still comes down to your
                    engagement with things; which is not something which fortune especially faciliates. In fact, it
                    seems our
                    fortunes are sought due to their clearing of pain, as oppposed to the freedom they provuide for
                    pleasure to
                    be gained. And when we consider what such aim requires, we realize that it is not but clarity and
                    commission; which is something that fortune merely orients from stable grounds. But only so you can
                    fully
                    be."

                    So our health is flanked by many elements. But of those sides which are remarked in terms of volume,
                    so does
                    our attention need to lye.
                    <br>&emsp;For I do not need motivation or courage to sleep on the flour; nor to walk in the morning.
                    Rather,
                    I need reminders, and at that understanding and design for our asanas and range of motion training.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, as I go through the ebbs and flows of inquiry, whereby I have some leaking
                    hole or
                    expansive need in terms of entirety, mind or death, so do I have an equally blended state when it
                    comes to
                    exericse; in that, of our up dogs for instance, that we had done some, did a few more by our natural
                    momentum, but then faultered to the point where they needed more attention.
                    <br>&emsp;For in that, lies the concern of effects, namely that of some certain motion, that we'd
                    remark
                    that the good from it was absent, and thus we ought do more. There is a similar concern as well, in
                    that of
                    skill and ability, as perhaps to predict further effects that we'd seek (by doing better forms of
                    motion),
                    that so in our training momentum and the promptness of our body and form per said exericse, that so
                    would we
                    remark as such for the sake of how we will grow as to then better be.
                    <br>&emsp;With that in mind, I submitt that we've done two solid stability sessions, prioritzing
                    lunges,
                    down ward dog, and each with an instance of solid up dog. I will remark on our findings of this
                    later; but
                    we can say that for now, these things, in terms of training and stature, along with the general
                    effects,
                    that so are we well.
                    <br>&emsp;I would say that our core is off; but so is this a result from stress and other
                    instabilitites.
                    Namely, upon moving the prior Saturady (near 9 days), we did two strenght sessions. We have been
                    active
                    since, and for a moment or two we did some high knees, but generally speaking, those effects are
                    wearing
                    off, and our volume when it comes to pushups and pullups feels strained. For the general effect from
                    our
                    pushups is fair, in the heart of our strucuture. But the lighter edges of it are a bit to firm, and
                    this is
                    likely from to little volume. I would say that in terms of pulling, that our need for it considering
                    our
                    aerobic and or structural state, is not essential; espeically considering that such attempts within
                    such
                    state lead to more rigidity in those outer portions. And in terms of running, I find much benefit,
                    but also
                    a working cost; which our stress regarding work's uncertainty is not an aid. But still, I feel that
                    in our
                    moderate state, that we can run, do some pushups, and with the proper bars, some pullups if the
                    moment
                    pleases us.

                    The world's complexion is such that, of its various canders and hues, so do they return to the
                    points once
                    been, and by that, blend with any subsquent or prior points: which indeed, makes for much warmth in
                    the
                    coldest days, 'as you know that change is coming'.
                    <br>&emsp;This creates a sentiment of indifference regarding our itineraries. For our life indeed
                    will grow
                    and end by the summer's day; but ought this be remarked upon by the elements of such course: leaving
                    year
                    ends and quarterlies for buisnesses.
                    <br>&emsp;In this sense, we can look at the time of our lives as being bare, or blossomed; and at
                    that,
                    warm, hot, cold and Icy. And marbling that are the clouds; and they may be dry, puffy or overcast.
                    <br>&emsp;For the world is not homogenous, in that as you go from top to bottom, so do the
                    arrangments of
                    said factors change. There is a sort of mirror considering opposites in terms of relative southern
                    and
                    northern distances from the equator. But all in all, one really ought assess their local pattern.
                    <br>&emsp;Far east of us lies a great flat. And between us and it is a line of mountains, namely the
                    coastal, columbia and cascade. In our little neck of the woods, we sit between the coastal-cascade
                    knot,
                    whereby one has come from the north to meet the tip of the one who's come from the south. In that
                    exchange,
                    lies the Fraser Valley; named by the prominent river which runs from the eastern side of the
                    northern
                    ranges, in between that coastal-cascade exchange. The land is generally flat, though there are some
                    hills,
                    if not minor mounts and plateaus; such as the strip between central Vancouver and Burnaby. The
                    foliage is a
                    mix of leafy and confier trees; along with surrounding areas of farmland and fields --some of which
                    are
                    either public, or lined by public trails. And flanking the western side, is the ocean, and all its
                    wafting
                    salted smell. Due north lies the head of the Coastal mountains. These come southwest into the
                    Northshore,
                    due south into Garibaldi, slighly more east into the Douglas range, and fairly southeast inot
                    Lilloete.
                    "While Mount Baker lines the northern tip of the cascades."
                    <br>&emsp;As for the warmth and hues, we ought remark the solstics and equinoxes per our hemisphere.
                    For all
                    I know, the winter solstice for those in the south, is when ours hits summer. At any rate, from the
                    winter
                    solstice, the land is completely bare, as is there a fair amount of overcast and rain. There are
                    some clear
                    moments, with clouds and open skies; but besides the propensity for purple hued dusks, the land is
                    essentially devoid of color. There is mind you, a vibrant effect by light, as such blankeness takes
                    it all
                    in. As are the morning moors crisp in their paleness, and at that tinted with a icy blue. As the
                    Spring
                    equinox is approached, the land begins to blossom and warm up. There is rain, but it is not as
                    often, nor
                    persistent when it occurs. And by that, there comes a medley of clouds; be it souly on days wihotu
                    rain, or
                    in the evenings when the rain has lapsed. To note, the early approach to spring is still cold, and
                    does not
                    get warm till the equinox happens. Upon that though, the land reaches full blossom, and begins to
                    settle
                    into a consistent heat. And as such, the evenings open up for sitting. As the solstice is met, the
                    ground is
                    dry, and the clouds are thinned out. They remain somewhat puffy, but it is more of a dry streak
                    across the
                    sky. And from here till the fall approach, the air is stuffy and hot. But as that ceases and the
                    late
                    equinox arrives, so is there a coolness which mixes with the lingering heat. And albeit light in
                    rain, there
                    begins to occrue great clouds in the sky. And alas the lushness nears its end, so do the colors of
                    it all
                    change, and at that, offer us a lenghty fairwell, as the land then becomes more bare, cold and wet;
                    upon
                    which the ice resumes and the sky-coverage sets in. But for a mere time though, as the ice
                    eventually wains,
                    as do the rains reign their excess in. And by that moments end, the puff of all that coverage lines
                    the
                    common points of our day; and in that, marbles the sprouting flowers and leaves. And through warmth
                    and heat
                    we're sent.

                    Needs are what, upon absence, bring us to cease.
                    <br>&emsp;There are means to such needs, both in ability and substance; by which our need is
                    comparable, in
                    that we must exhibit the motion of breathing amidst the prescence of air. The latter is the purpose
                    though.
                    And in terms of what we are, as to have needs, so is it that which ceases upon the abscence of that
                    which we
                    are porported to. "For such thing is given the titled purpose, in that it is the thing which we
                    require."
                    <br>&emsp;Along these lines then, we can consider that air, nutrients, water and warmth are what our
                    efforts
                    are aimed at.
                    <br>&emsp;In this though, we come to remark the factors which give life to the according means. For
                    if we
                    need food, then our capability is so, that it is persisent so lnng as it can sustain the body which
                    therein
                    substaniates the prescence of said capability. "Like a system which provides for itself; and by the
                    systems
                    needs, so do such appartus behave like an appartus which is given its own being by virute of being
                    an
                    extension of the thing which it satiates."
                    <br>&emsp;In that, we can look at our needs and means, and say that such means have their own
                    requisites. In
                    htat, for food we need locomation, and by that dexterity. While the means for warmth may be found
                    throug
                    shelter; but we thereby need the means for resourceufllness and design. Nor is the appartus for
                    scooping
                    water sufficeint without the sense to find it.
                    <br>&emsp;History lays it's basic claim here, in that, by our resolve to satsify our hunger, we
                    developed
                    such greater means to do so that excessive efforts could be attended. And by that, economy grew, per
                    the
                    exchange of novel goods. And from that, so did those baser productions of food get incorpoarted inot
                    the
                    economy; making them goods which were neccessary, amongst goods which were novel. Only, because
                    folk's
                    partcipation was based on their input into the labor required to extract such goods, so were
                    inefficneis
                    there consquential for those who'd otherwise be subject to their own local shortcomings. For the
                    food-system
                    was one that spanned the country, and by that, failed those at all ends of its borders. "This
                    contrasted the
                    local ventures, whereby those within a clan, or a village, lived and died by their own local
                    capacity."
                    <br>&emsp;As a result, the means to satiety were found by efforts prompted by novel exchange. And
                    through
                    currency, folks were compensated by those whose motivation for such currency, as to offer goods in
                    exchange
                    for it, was so as to also offer such currency to those who aided them in producing said goods. And
                    the
                    moderation of such venture was merely in the proportions, so that a profit could be made.
                    <br>&emsp;Of note then, is that as such motives were based on the prospects of exchange, the fact of
                    risk
                    and investment into such a venture made it so that those with such motives would share in the
                    capitol
                    required, and then split the rewards. And although the early stages of this saw a mixture of
                    indivudals and
                    groups making such attempts, so did the higher stages see broader cooperation, and by that further
                    inputs to
                    the requisite capital. Or better said, that be it initially, where the greatest risk and potential
                    lay, to
                    the matured moments whereby further progress could made, and at that benefit from the capitol to do
                    so, that
                    so things lay.
                    <br>&emsp;Through the advent of industry, the means for those with such motives was enabled, and by
                    that,
                    the output of goods increased, and also the potential for those seeking compensation for their
                    contributions. Wages mark the labored efforts of the former, while equity marks the capitol and or
                    stocked
                    investments, and by that potential return, of the latter.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, the economy is akin to goverment, in that each are a kind of soceital mode. And
                    by that,
                    the promise of the latter is in organization of the groups capacity, and at that, regulation of the
                    conduct
                    of those invovled. The advent of the former aspect is that through the excess' born by industry,
                    that so can
                    valued goods and producive labor be offered, and by that, quality of living and common wealth.
                    <br>&emsp;The downside, is that of that latter, that so is it banked on the availability of the
                    required
                    goods, and at that, the capacity for those in need to hold currency.
                    <br>&emsp;In this though, by perpetual attempts, one is subject to their according capacity; and at
                    that,
                    hurt upon failure. While the stability from production is one that is limited by one's work
                    elsewhere, and
                    it's fiat offerings as to purchase said products.
                    <br>&emsp;But in this, I would say, that the matter of stability, and the broader notion of freedom,
                    is such
                    that be it through hunting or gathering, or an economoy of any varied sort, that these are merely
                    means to
                    such settled ends. Indeed we may remark how we are in the mode of soceity were in; but for the same
                    kind of
                    gain. "For what is novel and basic does not change in a value'd sense. The only difference is in the
                    ease
                    and consistency by which said things are acquired."

                    So we need food. And our choice is either to gather it, or exchange cash for it. The former is
                    limited by
                    our abilities and permitt; while the latter is a mark efficeicny within the culture which would
                    produce such
                    goods to begin with, and at that the posiitions of labor as to award me the currency to purchase.
                    <br>&emsp;The principle though, is that one who gets what they need, is done so through a veil that
                    is equal
                    regardless of mode. Those being one of gathering or exchange. And it is important to rememeber, that
                    with
                    the change of society being long and gradual, that all who you are acquainted with, be it family,
                    friends,
                    offspring, romance and peers -past or present- that so will they be of the current mode. And by
                    that, we are
                    all part of this collective economoy, as we were of collective forgaing.
                    <br>&emsp;And so when I think of our progenitors, I see that they will be apart of an economy, and
                    by that,
                    be subject to the labor required, and cost of goods. As may there fortunes sway by output of such
                    goods.
                    <br>&emsp;Our remark though of the economical mode, is one that clearly varies in complexion. For
                    the Greeks
                    held an equal kind of economy as we in the modern world. Yet, the character of all our elements
                    differ then
                    them; particulary in the richness of our own.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, the moment we give up on our aversion to the 'neccessary' principle, is one where
                    we are
                    left to see what life is in respects to that.
                    <br>&emsp;For pain, and by that token the hunger for one's need, is something which will always run
                    paramount. "For our state amidst such a way, whereby a need is not met, is one which ceases our
                    ability to
                    be otherwise pleased. As our needs are such that they are, or rightly remarked at least, by the
                    satiety of
                    things which allow us to be. In living at least."
                    <br>&emsp;For life is in many ways a mere stripe in nature's canvas. Beyond the tiny details, there
                    lies an
                    esscence which is merely trying to proceed. And as enzymes bear us certain gifts, and oxygen the
                    means for
                    energy in our cells, so do the abscences of these merely alter the form of such esscence; whereby
                    the state
                    we'd call living, whereby the relation with nature is such as to exhibit such living form, that so
                    is an
                    alteration of this but a different orientation of such esscence, as to upon its cease, be what we'd
                    call
                    death, or a transition into the rest of nature's flow. For life is an assembly; in that the traits
                    we remark
                    as being inherent to living, are but the expressions of an ordered assembly. While death is but a
                    dissassembly, whereby those traits are no longer exhibited; and as it were, the portions once
                    assembled
                    drift off into the winds and currents.
                    <br>&emsp;In all of this then, you have two sides of things. One, is the state your in, your
                    condition.
                    While the other, remarks the motions of your time and attention. The former might describe a moment
                    of
                    peace, in that by your actions, such was your result; while the latter remarks your will, your
                    patience,
                    your oblige; by which your esscence, as assembled and exhibited amidsts the rest of nature, yields a
                    sort of
                    state in such assembly.
                    <br>&emsp;Virtue is indeed the term used to describe actions (from one to nature) that yield the
                    subject a
                    fair response. Namely, if all ends, in composition that is, were coneyed as either peace or despair,
                    then
                    virute would be that which, considering the subjects assembly, and that of nature around, that so
                    the
                    relation of the two brought that favorable end; and equally to the averse end, does vice lay. "My
                    actions
                    are of virtue or vice according to the result they give me. I may move in the same way for one or
                    the other;
                    but it is in truth, that per our relation with nature, that the motion I made would be evaluated as
                    having
                    been of virtue or vice, upon the result it gave me. Virtue and Vice then are judgements, in that we
                    reflect
                    upon the result of our actions."
                    <br>&emsp;It is to often overlooked that, in our assessments, that it is not enough to simply know
                    the
                    properties of our actions, but that of the qualities we seek. For it is one thing to say that an
                    action was
                    such, whereby we remarked what we did; and it is likely fair that the point we reached is also
                    simple to
                    describe. But as to what was dealt to us, in terms of our actual condition, so must that be remarked
                    upon.
                    For it is easy to say that I did such and such, and as a result, this thing happened. But this is
                    not what
                    virtue is measured by, but rather how such results impacted you. "Were you left in peace or despair?
                    And,
                    perhaps rightly so, were you, in the former even, moral?"
                    <br>&emsp;For that is soul the question ultimately. Not so much that we'd understand peace as to be
                    able to
                    remark what dealt us so; but that, in seeing what did, that our effective choice did not cause pain
                    to
                    another.
                    <br>&emsp;Oddly though, it would seem that as I remark the yield of my results, that so would my
                    moderation
                    against others be measured by what they, upon reflection, saw as good in their own yields.
                    <br>&emsp;At this point, we have some basic properties to our neccessary principle. For man is not
                    merely
                    pleased when he earns his share. Rather, he works with others as to bear an excess which feeds all.
                    He
                    doesn't do this out of generosity, but requirment. For it is not in his nature to satiate himself
                    alone. Not
                    that he wouldn't be pleased if he could; rather, by his self, he is not able. At least, being
                    consistent and
                    sufficeint is difficult to do.
                    <br>&emsp;And so by being collective, he is exhibiting a trait, or acting in a certain way, of
                    communcation,
                    aggreement and harmony, for ends which please him.
                    <br>&emsp;And I cannot entirely say whether morals are such, that by his pleasure in collective
                    harmony,
                    that he is admitting his own good alongside the admittence of other's goods. Or, if his virtue is
                    merely one
                    of an effective trait, in that by being collective, he finds what he needs. For in that, he is
                    acting in a
                    certain way as to satisfy the requirments in working together; the effect being one of finer
                    production.
                    <br>&emsp;For the concern then, is that morals seem more like something you owe somebody, while
                    principle
                    remarks what is wise for someone to do. And the truth in things, albeit hard to ever know, merely
                    forrays as
                    to what will lead to results worth acting for. While morals seem to enstate what is otherwise a
                    given by the
                    prescence of principle. But perhaps, the obligation in place, is there to counteract any lack of
                    principle

                    to
                    remove our hidden wants to explore, or cease our duties, so are we left with the nagging question as
                    to our
                    final purpose and place within such world. For without knowing so, that world, which seems ever more
                    present
                    as we are set in place, becomes both a source of scorn and sadness; as we either seek it, or are
                    ashamed not
                    to be with it.

                    In all, the complete inquiry of things regards the means for differentiation. Yet, it is oh so hard
                    to show
                    where the slight differences began; and where the aparent complexions are but compositions of such.
                    <br>&emsp;For I do not know if we have a soul, or if our mind is tapping into something, or
                    recieving at
                    that. But so much as we are fair to suspend our assessment, so may we say, that in all entirety, so
                    is there
                    the baser question of being, by which all other things are judged by.
                    <br>&emsp;The question then of morals, right and wrong, sin and virtue, is not much more than a
                    feature
                    within nature, or at least a statement regarding what we presume nature to be. For the latter, I'd
                    say that
                    evidence holds the soul merrit. While the former, marks a sort of challenge, in that we are at best
                    exploring the possibilities. It is worth noting that both sides tend to converge, in that what we
                    deem
                    nature to be, is both inspired, and at that confirmed by, evidence which we deem laudible by its
                    relation to
                    such truths we see. In that, miracles lie, and all things of intervetion or thought.
                    <br>&emsp;I would say though, that the basis of nature, and of a sort which is not to beholden to
                    antiqauted
                    concepts, is such as to be rightly tempid; as neither our physical understanding of the world is
                    complete,
                    and at that fully handled, for us to make any precident claims: as the ends are unknown. Nor, in the
                    evidence that we use to conjure causes, and by that, bear a sort of 'neccessity' to our sentiments,
                    as if
                    such maxims must be in order to produce what we mean to explain, that so in this are we quite
                    ill-formed in
                    any logic or philosophy which is, explcitily, born of evidence and concepts of a modern sort; nor,
                    in my
                    view at least, is there much richness within such inquiry, as would remark modern sentiments brought
                    through
                    our liberal ways. For the past did not allow for much exploration beyond the norms. And now even,
                    considering the baser facts established, so has there been little inquiry from that point. And by my
                    account, attempts at such highlight what facts are not understood, or ar absent to our personal
                    understanding. But foremost, is that in those inquiries there lies a depth which goes further down
                    then our
                    physical understadning can support; nor are there the right terms as correspond with such
                    understanding, as
                    to appropriaptely concieve of the realm of such depths; as the colors and hues of such abyss are not
                    naturally exposed to our definite senses; or at least the state of such senses is not developed
                    enough. But
                    beyond the promise of our path, and where such progress can lead us, I can say, that in the realm
                    beneath
                    there lies what can only be described as dark, awkwardly proportioned, and at that, unsure.
                    <br>&emsp;Our deepest belief though, as if a soul spike in our inquistive ground, is that although
                    we cannot
                    be much more than skeptical of the truth in things, that we can say that the mystery lies not in
                    proving
                    that there is someting which there is a basis for. For in our apparent being, there lies a evident
                    and
                    concieved conposition, all of which is sewn from simplicity. And the point is not so much to speak
                    of the
                    result of such weaving, but rather that such weaving occured, and by that, there must be fibres and
                    strands
                    to do so. "For even in our barest reduction of all things complex, there is still no supposed
                    blankedness;
                    or absolute unity at least, whereby uniformity and fullness is explicitly so."
                    <br>&emsp;In other words, albeit immesurably simple compared to the complexity we see, so is the
                    truth of
                    such composition possessed of character, and by that edges, traits, grooves. For without it, it is
                    hard to
                    see how there would be anything but the smoothest complexion. Yet, in the earliest evidence of
                    things, there
                    lies the grooves of dark matter holes. "So we ought clarify the edge by which objects are basically
                    deemed;
                    and how the depths by which said basis, be it seperate to said objects, or a mere darker spot to
                    their own
                    definition, can be better illustrated and explained." For it is not a meager task to describe
                    nothing. Yet,
                    with a bright eye and literary fidelity, the attempt is not so hard. For our mere idea of nothing,
                    and the
                    presumed difficulty in describinbg, is so, as to hold inherent traits which we assume within it; and
                    such
                    properties are in need of a steady hand to reckon such.

                    My thoughts are loose, but in esscence, we are becoming aware that responsability is a deeply
                    unclear object
                    in front of me.
                    <br>&emsp;As we approach our return to duty, so do we see that the future we once regarded, or so
                    merrily
                    trotted towards, is not at all defined.
                    <br>&emsp;For in our struggle to find some stability, we see that much beyond that we don't know.
                    Are we
                    meant for the world, for family, and in partciular offspring. Ought we travel; is there such thing
                    as the
                    world in an impassioned way.
                    <br>&emsp;I am not in any genuine sense struggling with the afffairs of our duty. Admittedly, what
                    is
                    familiar to me, and at that conceived as meager, is not something which our unfamiliar tasks
                    compare. But
                    ultiamtely, all points settle in and feel the same. And in consquence, the result yielded is one of
                    regularity to a task, and thus a station within one place. In that, our joy seems burdened by the
                    stability
                    whihc we seem warranted by; when there seems further deeds to come. That, or as much as we are
                    weighed by
                    our tasks, so do we dream of a route or end which would brace us not.

                    So we may not get the job. I will contact Amazon, though the shifts seem more sizeable then I care
                    for.
                    <br>&emsp;At heart, I am not concerned about our place right now. For as remarks our happiness, we
                    are free.
                    <br>&emsp;But life goes on, and as we know that we will not be a vagrant forever, so do I see that
                    we will
                    not be by ourselves forever. Nor will we be absent from the world.
                    <br>&emsp;Yet these things are all so far away. And in many ways, the heart of our suspense in
                    vagrancy; for
                    those other things are built on the requisite of us being non-vagrant; by which there is none who
                    hold much
                    above me.
                    <br>&emsp;What is odd, is that if I consider our forutnes, be it from time, the lands, or family, I
                    still
                    see that what I deem as promsiing from that, there is little to do with those supposed ends of our
                    future.
                    If we receive money, we are not thinking of its relevance to relations or family, but travel and
                    leisure.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, having the former is akin to buying a home, in that a down payment is
                    required along
                    with means to pay the mortage: meaning that it is but a matter of meeting the requirments, and
                    earning the
                    reward. Perhaps our confusion lies in the less than prevalent concern for providing for our family,
                    but
                    rather raising them, and at that, moulding them as not to be subject to, and at that personally
                    reach
                    fortune, but to actually live, and by that do so to their family.
                    <br>&emsp;Yet, we are left in all of this a sort of complacent to such interest. For I could almost
                    care
                    little for it to be.
                    <br>&emsp;One thought is that what we care for so much, at least what satisfies us enough not to
                    seek such
                    goods from family, is that our interests lie within blend of disregard and or unexposure to duty.
                    For we are
                    not required to have children or family; nor are we so discouraged. We in fact are at most subject
                    to
                    scrutiny over our personal dependance; yet such a situation only occurs because we find so much
                    relief in
                    having our meager needs met; whereby we have not oblige which bolts us to the ground. Admittedly I
                    have been
                    poor in making friends, and otherwise been too lavish in the one's we did make, and also foolish in
                    our
                    romantic attempts. And so the lacking of other's who bring security and strenght to your life is in
                    part why
                    you struggle to see much promsie in novelty; and at that, much care for accessory goods from labor.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways my life is such, that it has never been but a coming or steady going to
                    flourishing.
                    All squelching delights have vanished; nor have the impassioned flames of our heart been tended for
                    any
                    blazing moment. Instead, we have that feeling you get after exercise, or success in some work or
                    task; where
                    we breathe nicely and with ease.
                    <br>&emsp;Pleasure is very hard to state. For sex is clearly a marvel, as are trips and promotions
                    surreal.
                    And I don't mean to simplify them as mere moments. But we can say that the form of life is such,
                    that of its
                    entire canvas there are many spots; and such elations brighten spots of it; but do not strictly
                    color any
                    other. The fair admission is that, of those spots elsewhere, that the actions which effect those may
                    be so
                    as to enrich them, or make them pleasant, by the glowing effect from those brighter spots. But
                    wisdom doth
                    profess that the actions required to brighten the rest of the canvas does not come purely on the
                    elation of
                    those particular points; for the right choice need be elected, from the glee of those other
                    pleasantries.
                    "Ones' moments of pleasure bring a sort of well of cheer and intent, as to feel more free and open
                    to do the
                    right things. But beyond the effect of those points, in terms of pleasure, so are the accompanying
                    effects
                    which they inspire unaltered by those sources of inspiration; such sources are but mitigators as to
                    bring an
                    action to fruition: but the end of such action remain in line with the action which brought it: and
                    thus,
                    and influence to do usch action is but a motivation for another cause and effect. And wisdom fairly
                    suggests
                    that the orientation of our selves, from reason, is both usefull and required for cause and effects
                    of a
                    good kind to be the one's motivated. For a thief who was brought to glee, is only then happier to do
                    his
                    thieving."
                    <br>&emsp;Where we lie then, albeit obscure in quality, is of an end which has come by the leniance
                    of
                    tradition, and our otherwise forray away from its lingering threads. For we were not damned to not
                    have
                    relations or strict family lines. But we were ushered to a profession; if only out of the potential
                    benefit,
                    or the concern of the family we some day had. But in this, I sought not such benefits; nor were such
                    ends
                    but far off remarks. And by that, our later youth held not but a retreat from the duties proposed,
                    if only
                    because their labors and chastisment was without promise. Not till the blankedness of our consqeunt
                    state
                    began to fledge, did we take any part in forming ourselves to what did interest us. For in some
                    baser way,
                    the strenght one finds in being skilled and able, or of prowess, is such as to be pleasing; in a
                    comprable
                    way to settled peace, but of a confident and by that reasuring sort. And as it occured, in our lapse
                    from
                    the affairs of romance and profession, so did our self regard (and according practice) produce a
                    hankering
                    for such prowess. "And indeed, for some time, upon our bareness within the abscence of duty, did we
                    vehmently take to those self-committments." For such efforts were in themselves pleasing, and at
                    that very
                    rewarding in their honor and fortitude. Moreover, did they lead to an appreciaton of things, as
                    perhaps
                    remarked our more youthfull interests.
                    <br>&emsp;I think, that as histroy goes, that the depth of it all lies in the propogation of the
                    species.
                    For it is odd for someone to disregard that; or at least, considering theire nature to care for the
                    elements
                    which lead to such, that they'd not oblige themselves to so, or expect such things to happen. "As if
                    compared to our expected breathe a moment from now, that family was but a gasp that we saw years
                    ahead."
                    <br>&emsp;In this sense, I am wondering how the notion of happiness comes to be. For it seems a
                    weird, and
                    almost exlucisviely modern concept, in the way that governemtns operate in ways that are leagues
                    away from
                    our own attention. There are so many people as it is, and what one person does fails to faulter the
                    whole of
                    the species. Yet the sentiment of rignt and wrong, and what is othewise wise or foolish, cannot be
                    fully
                    stated.

                    My future is such, that I don't desire children or a family. I may want to the former, but the
                    latter is
                    merely an extension of that.
                    <br>&emsp;What I in fact seek, is someone to game with and someone to connect emotionally. Per those
                    wants,
                    there is an inflammed desire for the pleasures attributed to the latter; along with the glory sought
                    by the
                    oppertunity within the former.
                    <br>&emsp;But these are unnerved abbrasions to an otherwise stable wish.
                    <br>&emsp;And by that, I can say, that life can best be described along the lines of problems and
                    what
                    solves them. Wisdom would say what ought be the subjects for the former; while intelligence marks
                    the path
                    to them.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, I require nourishment; and to serve that, I need food. The means to this is
                    through
                    provision, in which the properties of such are in regards to income. So in my want of a friend, I
                    need be
                    open about our interest. In terms of romance, I need be vulnerable, honest about our expecatations,
                    and by
                    that, with care of others wants and interests, and not just myself. As regards children, I must
                    provide them
                    with the prescence of other people, along the supervision when our committments are elsewhere.
                    Regarding our
                    place in the world, all we have is our opinion and its varied forms.

                    For simplicity sake, we'll say there are two kinds of jobs: flexible and immobile.
                    <br>&emsp;For the latter, there is the concern of being stationary, and at that powerless to heed
                    your
                    passions for yonder. There is also the risk of coming and going, as such jobs are about employment,
                    as
                    opposed to gigs.
                    <br>&emsp;Flexible jobs have no inherent value; at least, the passion which a stationary job can
                    curry is
                    not absent from flexible jobs; they can merely respond better. Amd truly, coming and going is a
                    novel
                    pleasure, and can cease any staleness or depression in life. "The ability at least is calming." But
                    the
                    requisites for such jobs is in a skill that can be flexibly employed. As such, one must train to do
                    so;
                    which is not itself a drawback from the provision it provides. But, the actual use of it must be
                    sufficient
                    as to maintain said skill; so that the flexibility it is merrited on can be satiated by the quality
                    of the
                    ability. But on top of that, you must also submitt yourself to the employment. Which indeed may
                    lower as
                    time goes on, as the rewards of your application become richer. But so are we past the neccessary
                    training,
                    and into the progress through employment; whereby you grow in skill and fortitude through the
                    demonstration
                    of your novice means; to a point where such means become more promsiing, in that you can do more
                    lucrative
                    tasks; and by their richness, less of them. In other words, one must invest in the training
                    required, but
                    with a fair sense as to the use of such development for employment and further growth. For such a
                    path is
                    one that is in esscence fruitful; but by that, there is also committment and lasting expression of
                    said
                    skill; and one may not wish to dedicate themselves to that. Or, better yet, the novice years of said
                    skill
                    and their sterner needs, may not be so enticing. "For any path of this sort will lead to a state
                    which is
                    satiates you through little effort; but only so because you can do jobs that award satiety through
                    meager
                    effort: all the while your means to do so have developed to do so. For you are otherwise settled in
                    the
                    prospects which your novice skills can engage with." And beyond the actual good from the work, the
                    purpose
                    of it in being provisional holds the flexible quality of such tasks under the measure of
                    consistency. For in
                    being flexible, we must be able to employ ourselves with equal motion. And indeed, experience does
                    increase
                    your means to find such oppertunities where you go; or you may not leave your prospects due to
                    online. "It
                    is just simply the case, that these kinds of jobs are hard to cultivate with the meagerest amount of
                    effort.
                    For your promise never solidifes."

                    There seems regards for what I care for, and those which remark others. Friendship and romance are
                    not
                    limited by the simple ways of the former. But the subjects of the latter are not satisfied by the
                    extent of
                    such simplicity. I can remark that our vagrant stake is not a stable condition for our own
                    interests. But
                    the care for family is not a remark of that, but one of future equity.
                    <br>&emsp;For I don't wish to work from home for the sake of me. The work is either monotonous or
                    consuming.
                    And maturely, I see that our care to go where the perks of flexibility take me, are not substantial
                    when you
                    consider the good that your simpler stability offers. "I seek not that which more specialized
                    efforts
                    provide."
                    <br>&emsp;I lie then with a notion that our fortunes are such as to be sought so that we can merrily
                    proceed
                    and figure things out. But as the pressure to figure them out not feels so prominent, I see that
                    very little
                    of what I concieve as happening, will not occur naturally. Nor is a gradual prescence of your being
                    a
                    sufficeint state as to procurr such ends. Such a state may incorporate you into the world in ways
                    that
                    faciliate the requisites for such ends. But such an effect is merely the result of you being more
                    stable,
                    and at that comfortable in being broadly drawn, or positively hopefull and receptive to things you
                    concieve.
                    That may occur, in that you station in the world will compell you to more things; and at that, color
                    them
                    with worth, to which your oblige isn't one of insecure conjurings, but sincere want: of which you
                    happily
                    proceed, and earn the perks of having done so.
                    <br>&emsp;Again, this suggests that if we are working and happy, that friends will come our way, as
                    will
                    romance. And considering we have so many interests and cares, that the whims of these, ie. in
                    podcasts,
                    writing, things of posterous glory, will feed off of our confidence from such happiness, and thus
                    treat us
                    to the goods from those things we love.
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed this sentiment holds some truth. As our lack of friends or romance, in a baser way,
                    is a
                    factor as to why we feel to reserved in our pleasure, and at that, without enough pleasure or ease
                    to feel
                    peace in our station --whereby those wants from flexibility occur.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I am not so accepting of this personal stake in things; whereby we otherwise
                    ignore the
                    requirments for children. But I do see in this, that there are two paths; one being of hope from our
                    adventures and promise; the other being from our current pressures and unsure state, whereby we
                    anxisouly
                    see and dream of sufficeint scenarios (to meet those familial provisions) that are in themselves
                    pleasing.
                    "Whereby we held a stable scenario, which was pleasing in the obligate part."
                    <br>&emsp;The first scenario feels like the hopefull one. And I can say, that if we iron out all the
                    lingering fear and gloopy assurance, we are left with the tender and kind stability; in that the
                    fruits from
                    the more humane want of romance and friends, is such that the gradual growth and acquaintence with
                    the world
                    from there, is as humble and oppertune as those things we seek. "Whereas behing the hot one in town,
                    and
                    earning the according cred, is an aligned excess."

                    There is so much vanity, fear, pressure and judgement regarding our acceptence of a tender stability
                    in our
                    life, on approach to a firmer position which supports are natural want for family. "I might remark
                    that
                    essays and discovery make little blips; of quality sure; but besides your own rewards and fame, the
                    world
                    changes little. At least, the changes occur bit by bit. And time always caters to the bits
                    unimpacted."
                    <br>&emsp;That being said, if we hold true that the decades ahead are full of interest, and via the
                    tenderness around it, a supposed acrrument of firmenr means to the ultimate want of family. And, per
                    our
                    remark, that our place in reality is such, that by our own, through correspondence, or through
                    submission
                    and opinions/expression, that we'd be literary and according to the world. And such holds no purpose
                    for our
                    retreat into some foregin splotch of flowers: rather we can merrily be, on our own, via our advents,
                    and
                    through fortune or prosperity: but for the flowers, through that, which we easily see. And from
                    that, there
                    is not but our breathe, our muscle, heart and bones, our canvas of literature and knowledge, and the
                    otherwise heat of the land and age of our self and coming days -where future regards occur.

                    What is the best time to move? Well the cycle is such, considering our latitudnal constant, that it
                    will
                    more or less repeat in a timely manner. It is not irrelevant that you'd enter a new place on the
                    foot of
                    spring, or the exit of summer; but that you would feel the effects of missing one over the other, is
                    not
                    very mucb more than the minor experience of going through the stretch you choose. "And in accounting
                    for our
                    life, I can see, that through growth and maturity, that time becomes easier to sink into, and by
                    that, let
                    it whisp by."
                    <br>&emsp;In that sense, I can say that the foot of spring is such, that the coming months are warm,
                    full of
                    clouds, leaves and birds singing; nor do the mornings peak early, or the sun setting so late.
                    Though, once
                    said foot has settled, the land becomes dry, hot, thin in the attire and full of haze; and the days
                    are
                    longer, which brings on much excess of leisure; though the late skies are nice to see, and free to
                    do so.
                    "And our age is such that experiencing the mornings is tough; but our bend is towards that."
                    <br>&emsp;Te exit of summer is similar to spring, in that the land lush, warm and full of clouds.
                    But the
                    rains do begin, and as the entrence to winter is met, so do they come often. The cool airs are
                    nothing to be
                    averse to, nor are the leaves falling but a final welcome. But things do become bare, and eventually
                    frigid;
                    eventually pitching to a freezing cold.
                    <br>&emsp;Case in point though, as time goes, that so as the heart of winter sets in, do you reach a
                    point
                    where it is exited, and the foot of spring is on the horizon. In late January this occurs, as the
                    rains
                    become less severe; or at least less daunting as the winds and temperature don't mix them into a
                    freezing
                    tempest. And despite the lack of pleasure from the sleeping forest, there is more room to go outside
                    and see
                    the skie, and otherwise rest. For the sun rises earlier, and sets latter, and all the harshness of
                    the
                    winter ceases. The good to come has not yet occured, but there is still much which is naturally
                    present. And
                    by my accounts, if life were like that forever, there'd be little to complain about.

                    So I have no celebreatory remarks, merely those which reflect the heart of our path.
                    <br>&emsp;For our mom and dad pressure me for the right reasons. As pain, being the grand exhibitor,
                    is not
                    something that a mometns pleasure should be put of for. As we've learned, the nature of things
                    continuously
                    comes knocking on our day; or eventurally at least. Ansd whether such things are fairly known by
                    those who'd
                    implore me, so are they right in their sense that occurences of any sort will occur.
                    <br>&emsp;From that, I can see that our want of family is a final plea for us to be responsible. By
                    that,
                    our need as to faciliate that is the extent of our quest; concerning duties.
                    <br>&emsp;From this, I can say that of such quest, we've marbled the end, the right in our means.
                    But we've
                    got a somewhat open hollow between such ends. For we are not so stable right now as to be able to
                    pursue
                    such things; but as our want excites.
                    <br>&emsp;All in all, I see how our course in life is such, that for pleasures which are fair and
                    hearty, to
                    those which are broader and demanding, that so of the path we are on.
                    <br>&emsp;But I cannot say that our strides are full, or firm at that. We've seen much, and at that
                    learned
                    all but little. But our currennt place is not much as to reflect that; but rather a precipce to
                    action which
                    remarks what we've learned.
                    <br>&emsp;Our ignorance is not so prevalent, but our knowledge of things is not complete. From that,
                    I know
                    not which means would be best for those final pursuits. I have a sense of the qualities which would
                    bear
                    sufficiency and preference; but of what would fit such a bill, I am yet to know.

                    So our aim is such, that to return to a point in which I'll have to leave, is both unpleasing and
                    contrary
                    to basic future goods.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, we will have to continue working. And indeed, there being a state of this which
                    has a
                    balance of preference and ease, can form over time.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, I prefer efforts which are robust, as opposed to laborous or monotnous. This
                    is why
                    personal shopping is great; as your always moving, but lightly. Cooperation also plays a factor, as
                    you
                    build peers, and otherwise soften your days.
                    <br>&emsp;Another important factor is that ordinary jobs are stationary, in that you commit to the
                    position
                    their in. But if you stay long enough, you may transfer. At least, leaaving a job with the
                    confidence that a
                    new one will be found, is not only unnerving, but also a little deterimental; as you loose your
                    credibility
                    and stake. "At least it seems like something which you'd be better to hide; that you'd come and gone
                    to so
                    many jobs."
                    <br>&emsp;Now, there is the richer matter of wage and quality. The former comes through higher kinds
                    of
                    jobs, or specilized ones. While the latter remarks the form, namely in that you'd work remoetly. You
                    may
                    also do something meaningfull, and by that warrant your station.
                    <br>&emsp;In the simplest terms, these kinds of jobs are either steeped in requirment, or monotnous.
                    There
                    may be some which are not, and our resourecfullness will tell.
                    <br>&emsp;But an important remark, is that whether you must look and at that heed, or see and work
                    towards,
                    that you must be in such a place as to rightfully see the end you seek, and be drawn by it to go
                    through the
                    requisites; or, even in simplicity, you ought be able to apply yourself for such things. Better yet,
                    that
                    doing what is less comfortable for the sake of more money or flexibility, is a mark of your stature,
                    in that
                    you are not so sensitive to richer yet harder things. These sentiments have to do with the
                    gradations from
                    stability. In that, if you are secure, in that your needs are truly met, and that of such security
                    there is
                    space around via the advents of leisure and friends, then your skin will become thicker, your
                    confidence
                    more malleable, nor your dreams so depraiving, 'as you otherwise feel distant from a point which
                    contrasts
                    the lesser one your in: the one of which draws such far horizon'.

                    There is this sentiment which I have sought to explain; and I think I can.
                    <br>&emsp;It goes simply, that our work is meant to seep provision. And per recent insights, such
                    provision
                    is not based on what we need now, but a family ahead. Indeed, the state of our development may be
                    so, as to
                    remark our progress along such means; in that we were at a certain point to faciliate an according
                    measure
                    of want; nor were we lacking headway to grounds ahead which would faciliate more. "And our principle
                    is
                    such, that such ends ought be destined for the provision of family: for not much else is required
                    but what
                    the world asks for you in integrity, or the world in your opinion. And such means are in abundance
                    now: and
                    merrley flat because of our construction of it, rather than a lack of tools."
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, this future sentiment is atop the finer grounds of personal interest; whereby
                    the
                    means for such are as simple to faciliate our creative whims and expression. Such needs are but what
                    satiates our stomach and rest: and thus the income for the according food and bed.
                    <br>&emsp;In that though, the truth is that such affairs are not in themselves promising for those
                    future
                    ends. Nor are they at all sufficeint in their current state.
                    <br>&emsp;And the sentiment I mean to explain, is that so much as I don't care for that future end,
                    that
                    being dependant or not in terms of personal stability, differs only in the constancy of such
                    stability. As
                    those who you depend on, family namely, are not so lasting in their vagrant support; for they wish
                    well for
                    you in those final demands.
                    <br>&emsp;It seems that our interests are free for expression when we are the ones providing. But in
                    that,
                    we are merely at liberty to be on route or not for such final ends. "And your family is not going to
                    otherwise let you fail. All the while, your effort to support yourself, is free to do so in vain."

                    So consider this line of thought: Plutarch, as a dutiful man, who writes and smelters for his own
                    pleasure
                    and place, compared with the likes of Descartes and Hume, who seek much from their inquiry, as they
                    doubt
                    the declerations ahead, but in that, find no pleasure in merely thinking, but knowing; and by that,
                    they
                    seek praise and applause, as to warrant their quest, but are in effect worn thin.
                    <br>&emsp;In regards to Plutarch, I see his free time like a garden, in that he means not to sell
                    the
                    fruits, or earn acclaim; he might, and considering his novel attention, so may the expression of
                    such as
                    grown from his stability offer him some breadth; yet he does not care if he faulters, nor does he
                    yearn to
                    be heard, or finsihed, for in his duty he's already won; and in that, he is both calm in his wonder,
                    and
                    unsubjedted to the hopes of infamy; nor the associated fear of disdain. "For his duty already
                    absolves him
                    from the need to be known and seen: for he is already acquited. Yet steady, and as such, able to see
                    by the
                    fecundity in his oblige; whereby his gifts naturally extend, in both constance and design."
                    <br>&emsp;Descarte and Hume on the other hand have this restless search for mystery. Yet, there is a
                    contrast between the two, and of the sort which may remark their complexions. For both seem
                    inquistive, and
                    through that skeptical. And the source of this seems to occur by the falsity in the accustomed
                    declerations.
                    Where they differ, is that in order to find the truth further ahead, Descartes begins at the base of
                    things,
                    prooving he exists, all the while he doubts everything less reason provides; while Hume seems but
                    leaned
                    back, away from the indignence and cleracy of the accustomed front. But while Descartes creates the
                    world
                    anew, and finds in that a sort of novel understanding of the world, Hume merely inquires, and in
                    that moves
                    further than the truth once known, but to a point which is not itself complete. In that, Descartes
                    is whole,
                    yet mixed with ignorance and or complacence to his certainty. While Hume is merely alive and well
                    within his
                    further unknown. As such, Hume is remarked as being cheerfull and gallant; an instance of which is
                    remarked
                    in his tender comment regarding the false claim of man's wickedness, as compared to his ignorance
                    --and that
                    being the source of which we think is otherwise wicked. Descartes though, despite his adult acclaim,
                    reaches
                    a certain point as Nietzche, in that despite their productions and praise, they still remain
                    inquiring, and
                    bare the effect of being worn. Perhaps the key difference is that Hume is more happy and able, in
                    that the
                    unease which motiveated his inquiry was merely to state what he thought; wherein he moved past the
                    norms,
                    but by mere expression of a more well founded truth -albeit unwhole. While Descartes, and Nietzche
                    similarly, sought to rebuild; the source of which can only be remarked in some form of their
                    inquiry, as
                    reflects the depth of their doubt. "While Hume merely saw false reasoning, and sought to speak
                    clearly:
                    while the former two saw a foundation in need of renew."
                    <br>&emsp;In effect, you have Descartes and Nieztche, full in their acclaimed ways, yet still
                    pondering, as
                    if the weight of being proper in their completion wore upon them; for as history shows, more
                    thinking and
                    fact was to come; so almost certaintly there fuller theories were indebitaly false. And my suspcion
                    is that
                    they in some sense knew that. Or at least by virtue of the evident adolescence of their thoughts, so
                    was
                    there still more for them to ask. While Hume, in all his gallantry, seemed more pleased to have
                    offered what
                    he thought, and by that progress, won. While the other two seemed more enstated to the wholeness of
                    their
                    offering; which in terms of reward was perhaps foremost; for as we all know, Hume was only later in
                    life
                    remarked, while both Nieztche and Descartes were heradled as young men. The point however, is that
                    upon the
                    statement of a complete sort, that so did such an appeal by said makers, in terms of the care of
                    such
                    statement by such makers, weigh them down by the nature of such propsitions; in that, by their being
                    supposedly whole, that the measure for things is almost always further than that which you can
                    properly
                    profess. And my point is not that the demands of the public, as remarked their fame, led them to
                    further
                    perfection; but rather, that their own care, as remarked their offerings, of a whole statement, did
                    not
                    absolve them of restless need or want upon such statement being made; as such a statement, in
                    retrospect,
                    and perhpas by the still present difficulties of whole statements, brought them to an endless weary.
                    "Whereby what they sought, were credited to do, or merely thought by the liberty to do so,ledgered
                    in them a
                    ceaseless plea to reach said perfection. Fools of which they may have been, in that their methods
                    were poor
                    and false. But more than likely, it was there unsettled composition as to seek such completion, and
                    see
                    little in what they had, but what was still wrong."
                    <br>&emsp;Plutarch on the other hand is sentenced to something of an oddity. For if a man, less
                    composed and
                    centered as our friend, implores the idea of truth, then what is our friends actions worth? In that,
                    of
                    their supposed stabiliy, how are they rightfully so, when such truth is not known? Better yet, what
                    worth is
                    there in his novel offerings, when they are, for argument sake, mere thoughts; and not something
                    which
                    justifies his supposed stability, or advances the truth which would.
                    <br>&emsp;I'd remark Caesor's words in this case, whereby he says 'that things afar seem larger then
                    they
                    actually are; and upon coming close, they seem so small'. By this, we are to understand that what we
                    believe
                    to be the case is not always a proper subject for judgement; in that, despite the readiest and
                    fruitfull
                    resolve upon a certain scenario, that such amends, or the need for any, are not themselves just by
                    their
                    very relation to a supposed event: said event must be there, and of the complexion in which our
                    conclusions
                    are based. Otherwise the proposition is wrong, and any lauded appeals based on it.
                    <br>&emsp;And the point overall, is that those who's inquiry, however flavorable, is born from
                    restless
                    pining, or at least an unceasing need upon the steadiest of progress, that so are the claims and or
                    appeals
                    from such squanched and squinted eyes unbecoming. "As the perfection which they see, or deem to be
                    there in
                    the mould of perfection, of which the properties need only be told, seems more a mark from someone
                    whos
                    sense of such a thing, in structure or filling, is from a hurried and leary mind." With that
                    sentiment we
                    may rest upon the ever advancing laurels of what bears warrant to our actions: whereby right and
                    wrong, and
                    at that bad and goodness, is bent upon the scale of which we know so far as true. And nothing more
                    than what
                    that moment suggests.

                    So thinking of Plutarch, he seems the man whos efforts are born from the lessons of yore; in that,
                    upon his
                    lapse of responsibility, he learend the reason to amend; in both need and award. I compare him them
                    with
                    Hume in that each are quite settled in their path, in that life affords them needs which are common
                    to most,
                    and their place, per the collective of said most, is to be as they are fit within said most. Which
                    in all
                    simplicity, is to partake in the mode of such collective, be it governed, pastural or economic. And
                    to cite
                    our prior point, any caution and or concern as to the rest of the world, all while you partake in
                    your own
                    moral affairs, seems to be drawn by to hasty an eye. There are indeed things which are upsetting,
                    and the
                    conduct of the world does seem to stem from the accustomed truths, and their effect on culture and
                    policy.
                    But so ought one not hurry themsleves to a further truth, but simply speak their mind, offer their
                    opinion,
                    express the statements they think that truth would reflect. But time must go on; and if we think
                    that if we
                    just reached completion that all would change, we tend to run ourselves over, and fall behind the
                    ever-constant pace of things. Such things can be turned, but their results take centuries, if not
                    the very
                    least decades. And perhaps, as not to be flustered and worried about the inefficiency of the world,
                    ought we
                    be, in whats normal, and what is in all reason fair, set. For it is not so hard to find, that upon
                    doing in
                    a centered way, that our view of the world, in both its custom and effect, becomes less glaring or
                    concise;
                    but rather a medley of oceans and seas, lakes and streams, ponds and varied gusts of wind. As such,
                    we see
                    the world as less a point, but rather a broad system, of which we can only speak of in according
                    terms. In
                    effect, there is no event, or sight of said world, which is so as to draw a sense that perfection is
                    needed;
                    or a thing entirely to be found. For the truth in things, is that all the worlds knots lead to
                    tighter
                    points, or loose ones, and those enriched. But those sowers are but those rightuflly or not
                    commissioned, to
                    attend to their points, and mend them through the days and constant time. As such, our opinions are
                    all that
                    can be offered; as to influence those near and around us, or to some one who's commissioned effort
                    creates
                    too tight of knot. And by the parlance of credulity, so is the influence to one the source for
                    another who's
                    farther; as impressions get passed along. I believe this is why those prone to inquiry seek literary
                    fame,
                    for by prior times, and our expressive sense, that such fortuen and acclaim regarding such efforts
                    is the
                    way for broader changes to happen; as, per our word, so do more hear it. But none who are seeking
                    such
                    infamy, be it out of sympathy or whats vain, really have so much to say. There may be underlying
                    influence,
                    but only as much as you are in suspense enough to ask the novel question, do you produce anything
                    worth
                    remarking. And by that, the purest thing to do, is that which is not hasty or full of derision, but
                    rather
                    to do spread that which comes to you naturally, in your obliged state; one of which begins as if
                    instructed,
                    and that despite any true perill by which change is needed, so are we at least in line with our own
                    affair.
                    From which the mark of any with the plea for inquiry, comes gradually, and with a fashion of pure
                    conception
                    and regard: for of the world, of our wishes, to ends which were afraid not to me, so are we
                    uninclined.
                    Rather, we are at rest, treated, and at that wholesomely pleased. And what our eyes see is welcomed;
                    nor is
                    anything liable to imagery druged within us, but set with proportion; in which our sympathies are
                    whole and
                    fair, and not sweltered by grimmness.
                    <br>&emsp;To this, I say, with perhaps all the might of one who is calm enough to deem it, that by
                    the ideal
                    command, and our own false labors that have brought us of trajectory, that we ought be as such deeds
                    would
                    instruct us: or revert back to said path. "Wherein guidance is not that which bears us forward, but
                    back."

                    It is strange to consider that our instruction in life was wrong. For we seemed to be angled towards
                    a set
                    of experiences that our lessons were based on, in terms of what we could expect.
                    <br>&emsp;And indeed, our later life has levelled into seeing that the elements of such offerings
                    were not
                    far off; but in terms of their complexion and hue, so has the past, and our own sensibility,
                    revealed
                    otherwise.
                    <br>&emsp;For I see that a child is a dear want. I may not desire one now, or a deep relationship.
                    But these
                    are bound to happen. And so much as they do, so are our personal efforts, be it vagrant or stable,

                    ill-fit for such affairs. "As they are, in all bareness, comparable to homes and cars, in that you
                    must meet
                    the requisite costs, including maintence."
                    <br>&emsp;In that, per the truth in this, I see that our life's amends is such that family
                    requisites are
                    required. As far as I know, the cost of this is such, that for myself and partner, we need little
                    more than
                    what pleases us, and any minor addition in terms of what is practically required for bonded living;
                    and for
                    preference. But as remarks a child, of which I am sound to only have one, I see that our requisites
                    are in
                    principle and strict cost. For I don't believe that, beyond the special contents of the beginning,
                    our need
                    is to provide much more than we need ourself. And by that count, if we could offer what we each
                    require,
                    then the need would be as much as combining half more than what each of us already provides: as to
                    warrant
                    an additional hole. As our pairing introduces novel if not desired developments, so may our family
                    be
                    similar. But in esscence, beyond a small living for the two of us, to a more moderate one, so is
                    there a
                    relatively small living for our family, and a moderate one beyond that. For once we introduce the
                    scale for
                    instruction, we realize that our interest in having children is not much more than natural meaning
                    and care;
                    and of what we hold our child's interest to be, so is of the truest sort. Which is not, upon a brief
                    relfection, impacted by living conditions beyond the moderate sort.
                    <br>&emsp;Briefly, I would mention the novel aspect of modernity, in that we can easily work
                    remotely; and
                    as such, live remotely, and by that, travel with our kid. Let us say though that such means were not
                    available; and that, despite having such econmic means, that the oppertunity was not much more than
                    occasional travel. For perhaps friends, or medical needs, required that we be in Canada longer. And
                    to our
                    point, in a permanent fashion, in terms of remaining local. What then would our life look like? For
                    we'd
                    satiate our own needs and that of our child. As would we raise them with composure, and the
                    principle deed
                    of integrating (our kid) with other people. But as I then think about education, work oppertunities
                    and self
                    expression, I am left with a blank sense of what we mean to do. For our life may in fact remain the
                    same.
                    And from there, we are more or less kept till our kid becomes their own. But that is likely a decade
                    and a
                    half away. Though perhaps the irons keeping us local would cease our child aged. By which our novel
                    advent
                    of remote work, could permitt us to travel. "For their development could have already occured, and
                    they'd
                    have more means to socialize and mingle in newer areas."

                    So were reaching a point of harmony. My intent to live here and work is known; and our aid with the
                    garage
                    door has earned me some cred. I will not say that we are not at risk of chastisement, in whether we
                    get a
                    job immedately; or in lue of not being where we prefer. But I think that our intent and persistence
                    to go
                    where I wish to, is one that were free to.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I see the burden of life beyond our person l happiness. For like escape velocity,
                    so is
                    such a happinees, in all its pure moments, subject to the wear and indolence of independance; or the
                    coming
                    request to do so upon a stretch of dependance.
                    <br>&emsp;And so I mean to treat this well. And, via some sort of principle, ordain ourselves to the
                    live
                    which is operative for whats pleasing. Doing so when we are unsure of ourselves, and perhaps set
                    such
                    operations which are more painful and draining, is hard to say. For we run the risk of painting
                    nicer
                    pictures, and at that setting some hopefull intent; but all with the motive, or care to soften the
                    future
                    infront of our current happiness: and condition which, albeit nice and rich in memory, is not
                    stable, and
                    apt to continue.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I see the need for some strenght in our stability. I see the further ends of a
                    broader
                    reach, but such things don't compell me now; nor do their means feel as drawing, considering how
                    their
                    demands compare with our current interest. I do so though, that from what we've learned, and over a
                    fairer
                    and sturdier constance of time, that our personal stability may faciliate such happenings; be it in
                    our
                    steadyiness to see and seek farther things, or the mere attempts to do something familiar and well.
                    And
                    indeed, par our personal course, there is the sentiment of pure correspondance, along with being
                    more
                    romantic and social. These are the outer layers of our personal stake; while the security of
                    ourselves can
                    extent to closer friends and interests.

                    So were on thin ice in terms of the sentiment regarding work. We've shown our persistence in both
                    effort and
                    interest, to work at superstore; and I believe that we've been given some right to pursue so.
                    <br>&emsp;It seems unlikely that we will get hired before the years over, and I'm not all to certain
                    we will
                    get hired thereafter. But barring any peculiar reason, we ought be hired in the near future.
                    <br>&emsp;Initially, I thought this was unofrtunate, as the option to stay a year and make an easy
                    transfer,
                    seems a pain if we are not hired now. But I believe there's merrit in thinking that moving to
                    Vancouver upon
                    the entrence of winter is not advisable or desired. Getting situated by the foot of spring seems a
                    better
                    option, and doing so as winter exits seems prime for such. If we were able to transfer for Februrary
                    2026,
                    that would suffice. And otherwise, barring our decree of immediacy, we may just work from this
                    winter's end
                    till summer's end, and simply make do with our cash, and force the transition.
                    <br>&emsp;Dad is laving
                    <br>&emsp;Dad is not leaving till this weekend, but he seems to be staying till the beginning of
                    December.
                    He has an appointment in Kelowna on the 28th, and he and mom will come down with Dora after. By my
                    interest,
                    and what I can openly share, is that we are going to contact Dev in December --or every few weeks. I
                    don't
                    believe this will reward us, but we can at least address the sentiment. "For I am not concerned,
                    especially
                    since we see the trajacteory ahead: near and far." In that, I am with some hope that the holidays
                    will be
                    ours, as less Amazon alerts us, we are simply going to wait till New Years, and press to get the
                    job. "And
                    there is some work to be done in terms of ironing out our reservation and preference; when in fact,
                    working
                    part time in any capacity, all while providing us with the current and future means to securely be,
                    is not
                    so bad; and beyond the anticapted sentiment, you can almost certaintly scale your shifts as time
                    goes on; if
                    only to two 8 hours. And three would not be so bad; and would in effect, mirror our future means to
                    live
                    privately --in an 1100$ basement."

                    I mean to work at Superstore, but I am also looking for any online jobs. Some seem like scams
                    though, so I
                    thought you might have some insight. Data Entry jobs seem the most prevalent, along with product

                    are
                    effects we see, but know not the origin. OF the effect known as percpetion, and feeling at that, so
                    is this
                    a bit vague in terms of an observation. But even if we take it to be true, we are still then left
                    with the
                    source of it. Which in all honesty, seems comparable to all other effects, in that motion is the
                    supposed
                    cause, and thus origin.
                    <br>&emsp;But motion is a tricky thing

                    So I have a plan, and it comes down to our current scenario and it's relation to a supposed time of
                    independance; whereby the latter is embraced via the steps bound from the former; which,
                    definitively, are
                    not so independant, and by that costly; in which I may save and bolster that later time.
                    <br>&emsp;I cannot say what I'll do when I get to that point. Indeed it seems nice to rest on the
                    potential
                    of life, and its mixing with our promise. But I see little which I am hoping for, beyond the fairer
                    dreams
                    which would yield me ease within the future's demands. But I am all to happy to let such future
                    soften her

                    So I have no immediate plans. I've tried Superstore, and they were not hiring part time. Amazon
                    seems
                    equally promising, but their not hiring either.
                    <br>&emsp;In the short term, Superstore has said, and I do fairly expect, that by January we will be
                    hired.
                    Amazon may look for seasonal, or part time in general; and their employment would be easier to
                    leave, and be
                    novel at that.
                    <br>&emsp;Beyond that, I mean to save some money, and leave at the end of summer. I only wish to do
                    so, for
                    I mean to be somewhere that I'll stay long term. Pitt Meadows could be that, but being with my
                    parent's
                    likely not. Not only does it lower our ambition for trying new things, so are we generally in a spot
                    with
                    less to do. And I do wish for soccer, community and connection. Some of which can be had in Pitt
                    Meadows;
                    and considering the niceness of it all, I can say fairly that I'm fine.
                    <br>&emsp;Long term though I have less clarity. The main issue being the nature of work, the
                    requisites, and
                    our current and or antcipated attitude towards such --as regards interest and fortitude.
                    <br>&emsp;In this, I am considering ESL, some form of Yoga, writing, and in parlance with that a
                    degree.
                    Programming seems less likely, as I care not to get fluent, nor work so intimately like that. THose
                    others
                    fall under that line as well.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I'm landed then is the creator economy. Which indeed has qualifications, but more
                    importantly, platform customs and the user's material. First, each platform requires certain profile
                    choices, if not content pedigree, to earn money. And such formalities ought be understood; but also
                    mitigated by future adaptibility. Second, each platform has customary designs, and elemnents at
                    that. Namely
                    hashtags, titles, descripitions, thumbnails, along with the contents form and assets. Lastly though
                    regards
                    the material, in that you may grift, opinionate, entertaint, game, educate, or merely show something
                    funney.
                    Our interest is in writing, and generally about science, history and wisdom. I have a million words
                    at my
                    disposal, and more to foster through other's treatment. We have gone this path before though, and
                    our
                    exhibition of platform design was not excellent. I did enjoy the creation; though, upon the second
                    chapter
                    of said material, I found little promise or interest. I felt like we were hustling our deepest
                    cares, and
                    that felt off. One reason this deterred me, was because said efforts were to due with treating
                    other's work.
                    The form of it did not return much to me, and our caliber within said formalties did nto suggest we
                    close to
                    an upward slope. And indeed I must reflect, and chart the writing at the time, but I just stopped
                    caring.
                    Now, I am more focuesd on the returns of such effort. And given that our own work is viable for the
                    material, am then more interested. As for the form though, I have seen grifters speaking about AI
                    for some
                    time. And indeed, across blogs, photos and videos, AI has made a plethora, albeit generic amount of
                    content.
                    What I figure, is that because every niche is saturated due to volume, that the novel and or desired
                    personality of the material gets blocked out by the abudnance of other's work. It's generic, but
                    theres so
                    much. Moreso, is that said abudnace is of the highest quality, in terms of assets and surroundinbg
                    material.
                    Becasue of this, anything which means to create sincerely, must do so in a way that is equally
                    appealing, in
                    terms of the form. The thing that's struck me, is that the means to said quality is accessible
                    through the
                    exact means that such quality comes about. There are programs which make those abundant amount of
                    generice,
                    yet quality videos; can we not do the same? The real difference is that within that abundance, the
                    material,
                    in terms of a script, is also generated. We have our own though, and can find some meaning,
                    interest,
                    creativity, and at that, generosity towards such creation. There's truly promise in that. And
                    considering
                    our desired scale, I would nto fret if in two years, we were making a couple hundred a week. For we
                    have so
                    much, in terms of Winter, Limit, Rounding Out, Near Light, Summer, Warm Winters, and the whole of
                    this year
                    so far. Nor is there anything revereance for the abundant amoutn of literature, and personal study.
                    We
                    merely need a form.

                    ///I'd be fine to remark little and live, but our situation is usch, that by some pervading force,
                    we are in
                    need of employment. I care not, nor am I glaring away; we have accepted and delighted in the
                    potential to
                    stay in Pitt and work at Superstore. And indeed, anything under 20 hours per week will do. But right
                    now,
                    all we have are our applications, 10 of which I've sent. Dad is leaving the day after tomorrow, and
                    will be
                    gone for some time. I will with some earnestnest try; though communciation appears the trouble. For
                    those
                    attempts may not even be enough, and we ought to be more forward and submissive. We will share our
                    application, and seeing as their gone, time will go by; yielding me some pleasure, and bridging
                    between the
                    supposed return to Superstore. "Day after New Years, and I will work any form of part time. We can
                    at least
                    adapt our life that way."
                    <br>&emsp;As a quick note, content creation has a weary economoy. But the reward in it is one of
                    interest
                    and mobility; and so the haziness of it is not without worth. By that, there is material and form,
                    and of
                    the former I see our writings being such. The latter has a range of stillness, or basesness in the
                    imagery
                    and sound, along with the automation in which it is done. If it is less so, then we need motivation
                    and
                    productive pipelines; while it being more automate means our material interst can hold suit.
                    <br>&emsp;I reflect on the fact, that upon a stretch of activity, we generally seek rest. But there
                    is this
                    problem of returning to motion; for indeed our recovery may come short, and yield us to little
                    energy to
                    return. And consqeuntially, we are stiffened by our lack of range of motion. And indeed, our ability
                    outright is guided by our enduring and restorative capacities. For now, I would do more than free
                    range, but
                    not rush range of motion. I think that Vinyasas can serve some opening, as does running carry us
                    forward.

                    Ultiamtley, I see myself as a man, yet a boy too, whose morals lie in ignorance, rather than
                    admittence.
                    <br>&emsp;There is a reality to things though, and a wide difference between irratable senseation,
                    and that
                    of ultimate weariness.
                    <br>&emsp;In those, you may rest, knowing that the fear ahead is drawn from the poorness of your
                    cuurrent
                    step. "Life ought already give you enough, to be both occupied and forwardly bent; whereby, through
                    the
                    former you become more, and the latter holds such gain to some end."
                    <br>&emsp;I sit here then, somewhat frigthened, for duty has been placed upon me. In all honesty
                    though, it
                    is not that which concerns me. True, there is communciation required, and via surprise, there may be
                    less
                    room for us to breathe. Like our finances though, there is a sense, albeit limited in finality and
                    in all
                    fair nearness, to our harmony; in terms of what we knnow and our handle.
                    <br>&emsp;By that I see things as fair. The weather is poor, the tree is going up. Nor is our mother
                    here.
                    But I will admitt that excuses are not what will be well recieved; and so I'm not making one. I just
                    want to
                    live a little, and give myself permission to be as though the gust in our effort is being judged.
                    "Oh well,
                    I tried, is not what I'm saying. But weeks are no small length, and the care we have lies on the rim
                    of that
                    edge." Sentiment may hold me more, and burn our content. But this is not so expected. Our father
                    said that
                    our need for a job is not pressing: no rush he said. Our attempts to try are enough; and I am sure
                    that time
                    will go before more effort is needed. The feeling is like that at least.

                    I feel happily shot, 'like someone, disposed to peace, but is nervously comfortable'.
                    <br>&emsp;It is not in any fair sense, the fault of those which spark our angst. Such a proclivity
                    comes
                    from the awkward bent of our soul. Nor do our questions as pertain to such soul, 'as if were were
                    identifying the nature of that which was wrong', holds any real merrit when it comes to our insight;
                    for
                    such remarks really amount to compressing yourself out of this confined state, and in effect,
                    drilling
                    forever inward to some supposed source. The aim of this though is negative, in that it comes from
                    our
                    response. And as such, like the sun's glare, we turn away; but with the consquent neeed to find
                    somewhere to
                    go, in which our source being the problem becomes the fixation point. Yet we only burry further,
                    never
                    reaching a fixed end. "Like the awkard contraiety of nature's solid prescence, yet is more deeply
                    evident to
                    be small, bare, hollow." And our weary time comes from reaching for that voided point.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, the mark of a man is in the simple fact that he's being one. Without
                    comparison to
                    other objects, I merely say, of the one which are, of a sort, are we so when we can speak, see, hear
                    and
                    touch; and with a sort of rigor, in that we are not to stirn or forwardly wrenched, nor to layed
                    back and
                    soft, but firm rather, solid, real, pure.
                    <br>&emsp;Our regression burns via the coals of kindling. And such things furry is up, and earn our
                    mournfull care. But we are not but that which is born from 'drying the timber, and making us
                    excitable'. And
                    the irony is that in such a diffused state, we spend more time near the flame.
                    <br>&emsp;For in many ways the root of our ends is from our choices. And such choices, as make us
                    dry and
                    suscpetible, are bade from a ignorance to rules, and bumbling inquiry. A sort of conduct in which,
                    less you
                    remain enriched as a fool, 'you don't trust yourself, as you know the good that had once been
                    before'. The
                    burnt state were come's from a sort of tearing contrition, whereby we hastle ourselves out of this
                    poor
                    state, but invertly pitch ourselves into the ground; the effect of which, bares its form in the way
                    that
                    such a pitched state seeks thing. For the things which are dear are those which we find delight in,
                    in and
                    from a state of joy. While the care we have in a burnt state, are of that which such a state can
                    recieve.
                    The treats of the former come only to those who have seen, and from that mould themselves to gleam
                    further,
                    and as such, hold no entrence to those whose sight has whithered away. We are so happily shot
                    though, for we
                    find remants of such pleasure even in our pitched state. Only, as we comfortably drive through the
                    lands of
                    gratuity, so are we charred in our surrounding epxression; in that those former goods, despite there
                    lingering place, loose such prescence; making us somewhat resorted to keep to the goods on our
                    drive, and to
                    the effective end. And perhaps the point I mean to make, is that such objects, in all their flavor
                    and
                    charm, hold not whihc my memory dreams of of the past, nor what my content and pleasure relish as a
                    promised

                    I never have much to say, as can be seen when I state the mystery in things. Indeed, there is a
                    rawness to
                    our sight, and the admittence of our reservations to things is but an according attempt to say
                    anything at
                    all. And I care little for being blunt, as there is not much inquiry in that: which is all a man
                    seeks.
                    <br>&emsp;For I know I lack friends and things other, as are there things which would be nice, and
                    at that,
                    achievable by our constant effort. But so are we free and fine, however wobbly and off. The weather
                    comes,
                    it goes, and by our industry and might we greet it. But the days indoors, besides slowing me down to
                    a
                    vulnerable degree, are not so poor, by our activities.
                    <br>&emsp;I'd simply remark that the pitch of our time, be it slower and paced, runs contrast to our
                    middling state, whereby we have little to say, but wishes for progress. To that, as one who wakes up
                    late
                    cannot help but succumb to such effects in the day, that so do all our choices bear as as such, and
                    requie
                    us to do nothing but concede and amend

                    The world of deduction bares us a brute end. Inquiry though, and working to principle, rather than
                    from, is
                    not an argumentative process, but one of observation.
                    <br>&emsp;From that, we remark upon what we see, and ask what it means. We may reckon the terms, as
                    in the
                    notion of how there's anything at all, or maybe we, in a scholarly or illustrative sense, paint the
                    portrait
                    of such observations, understanding what they are as objects, and what they mean.
                    <br>&emsp;And like Socrates exposition, Aurelius' reflections, or those comparable strides of
                    Montainge or
                    Emerson, so do we turn such sight towards ourselves, seeing who we are, and what we mean.
                    <br>&emsp;There is a improper property though of this inquisition, namely the relation we have to
                    the world,
                    where we wonder how we are as to earn meaning by such things; in a similar light as to say, beyond
                    what
                    something appears, how it is in relation to the baser strands of nature, and being in general. By my
                    accounts, this distinction between us and the world, and that of objects and the world (or nature),
                    holds
                    more sway via tradition than it does from merrit. And indeed, those blunt strides of deduction come
                    from our
                    attempts to be as such, where the admitted mysteries of ourselves (and things around) drives us to
                    make
                    explicit statements.
                    <br>&emsp;Here is the beginning of things though, the channel for process. If we are to inquire, it
                    is
                    because we wish to and can. But the response to our prompts, which curries us to keep forward, is a
                    remark
                    as to the frontier yet ahead; and our according immaturity. If we are to deduce for the sake of
                    completion,
                    we are doing because our investigations are not full in their yields; and almost naturally so,
                    considering
                    they only mean to desxribe and illustrate, rather than know.
                    <br>&emsp;In any case, we might say that our observation merely exclaims what's seen, and by that,
                    concieves
                    all things which urge our inquiry as things of an equally happneing sort. In the same way that the
                    motion of
                    the moon is but a sight we've seen, so is the rapid beat of our heart but a remark made, during a
                    moment of
                    exhaustion. Indeed, there is still a unmodern vocabularly as to the motions of our mind, in terms of
                    our
                    fear and curiosity; but the point still lays. We are not here mending words in order to reach some
                    alternate
                    deduction. Such an attempt would have us but in a different dress, but equally ordained to faulter.
                    Said
                    ways are but a blatant acceptence to our inquiry's shortcoming, and the consquent concession to
                    proceed with
                    the certainty which our observations can draw. The point though, is that said proclomations are but
                    a
                    stronger guess, there being some evidence to support them. But the consquence is one of
                    disagreement, and
                    the irony of there being so amidst a proclaimed certainty.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I mean only to say what I see, and remark ourselves by a continued inquiry. The
                    subjects
                    of such pursuit are but rooted from things far and near that I've noticed; and as I have motions
                    while
                    running, fleeing and at rest, so are there finer motions --comparable to those dextrous-- when it
                    comes to
                    remarking upon things, and furthering ourselves as our observations spring. For instance, our angst
                    is but a
                    clawing sensation, pinning our openenss against a gritted wall. As in many cases, our very ailment
                    from this
                    blurrs our sense to recognize that we are experiening a symptom, rather than normality. But via the
                    domain
                    of all experience, and the natural bent of men and their outputs to other's around, so are there
                    enrgaved
                    motions and experience which trickle out of these confined and senseless states; to the point where
                    a clear
                    recognition occurs, and resolution attempted.
                    <br>&emsp;Weirdly though, those prior experiences which hold there place beneath the surface level
                    disturbances, have there place via similar recognitions and resolves. Said motions may have been
                    brought on
                    by parental guidance and pleas, or the bulk of common strides which retain in us some core propiety.
                    Riding
                    a bike for instance never goes away, even in a delerious state. Nor do we lose our means to read,
                    speak,
                    walk and breathe, despite possible erosions from a current ailment. And the point, is that in all
                    things, or
                    moments rather, some recognition and resolve occurs, if not by a drip. In a word, the slightest
                    slope will
                    bring all water to the sea, and by that, will the ocean rise. Our experiences fair accordingly.
                    <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst these subjects, or recognitions in myself, is the lack of curisoity
                    regarding
                    death. It seems common, in drama at least, that children often wonder what death means, and what
                    happen's
                    when we die. I would say that their somewhat concerned, and likely so for they've heard remarks
                    about; such
                    things being the charms of the wind blowing by from time's past. But looking at the source for such
                    gusts,
                    you come to the question as to why anyone remarked upon death at all? Is it for the simple reason of
                    closure, or comfort; to know that a loved on, or yourself, were set for some fine destination? I
                    really
                    can't say. Nor am I left with anything but two glaring points, namely as to the concern for a
                    destination at
                    all, and whether or not such concept held a dual end: meaning that the afterlife was regarded, and
                    the
                    promise of the light side being reached held one's comfort.
                    <br>&emsp;But both sentiments seem obscure in their origins? And only mention that, for in our
                    current time,
                    where the utterings of such things are, as I said, heard through echoes of older ways, and by that
                    practiced
                    by those who gleam to such, but in private, that so are we in some sense left with an original
                    question,
                    like those in that rooted past. For we are not presently with any pre-conception or influence to
                    what death
                    would mean, nor, I admitt, is there much which strikes me as being relevant about it. In fact,
                    considering
                    that we are influenced by the words of others, and in a better light, encouraged by those who,
                    depsite not
                    being afraid, still reflect and define for good in inquiry, that so in our own remarks, have we
                    relished in
                    a fair and simple concept of death, one in which the comparison to sleep has me seeing both as calm
                    and
                    gentle. "Such a statement, albeit driven out of curioisty and principle definition --and not fear-
                    holds in
                    me a sort of strenght and secuirty; for death indeed, albeit not inherenlty frightening, does hold a
                    sort of
                    neccessity; and by that, having a defintion gives the course of yuor life some sense." And it would
                    not be
                    right of me not to mention the obvious notion of death's appeal, when the fact of its mystery pairs
                    with
                    that ultimate point of it. But I am not sure whether the culture which developed in terms of it, was
                    so by
                    their own means to develop some sort of finality, for it's own sake.
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, I reckon the most prominent source of our regard for death, lies in our
                    closer
                    mysteries, namely mentaility. For such a thing, whereby dreams, vison, fear and doubt are colored,
                    holds
                    with it the deepest yet obscure relevance to our life. And I believe that, the weight we fairly give
                    to such
                    things, in binding with the little of it which we truly know, makes for a sort of baser uncertainty
                    about
                    things. "For we don't even know ourselves." But it is not so far off, by my account, to suggest that
                    the
                    obscurity of death does not pair with the obscurity of our mind; and that the apprhensions and
                    wobbliness
                    which come from the latter, meld with the nature of former being unknown. There's surely more to
                    this, but
                    we might say, in one sense, that our condition, or provclivirty rather, to be nervouce and or
                    unsure, makes
                    the greatest thing of uncertainty, in death, the more concerning. This is likely why the steady man
                    still
                    benefits from defining death, for he is at least sure amidst his comfort; while someone less sturdy,
                    seeks
                    for a relief to their fear, the defintiion of which bears them said claim.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I land then is in the managment of oneself, and how this, by its ordinary stability,
                    procurrs that indifference to death. For like a threat approaching, even the bravest of us locks
                    onto it;
                    unafraid sure, but attentive to the thing which their bravery holds them up to. But those nervous
                    act the
                    same, and likely moreso, in that their fear of something, draws their attention to it further. And
                    so, by
                    one's proclivity, not only is there view of it likely different, but so is their care for it equally
                    less.
                    <br>&emsp;The question though, is what would bring a man, in all his composure, to attend to death;
                    or find
                    reason and principle to do so. For I am sure that there are other men like me, who have no fear of
                    death's
                    mystery? It also may be so that their confidence brings their attention elsewhere, and away from
                    death's
                    waiting eye. By that, death never scared me, or alarmed me personally as we made our own broader
                    attentions.
                    But, the nature of such attentions were such, that our grip on life was not solid; and so the
                    postive
                    response from defining death, brought with it some strenght for that. As I'd state it, our efforts
                    brought
                    us to an open view of the world, and with that, an annoyance with cheap words, a fear of whether
                    they might
                    be right, a rancour as to our self-inccured afflictions, and a cheerfull heart which bore us a
                    measure for
                    such contraierty. There are life lies.

                    As in most things, our limited knoweldge prevents us from making simpler inquiries. In this case, I
                    feel too
                    stuck in comparing deductions with observation; and at that, the irksome point of poor concepts home
                    to the
                    former.
                    <br>&emsp;But alas, I can say, as I think I last mentioned, that my life is such, that it found
                    itself
                    moving a certain way, but in such strides as were in relation to the world; and by that, the
                    obscuirty of
                    such extent brought with it a tearing sensation, 'as if there were fires on the horizon'. To this
                    day those
                    flames still flare, but it is our personal solidity which has rendered them less scorching.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I fail, or have not yet succeeded, is in a full portrayal of the unknown world. For
                    deductions are not wrong, nor are the results of observation truly insightfull. But there is a great
                    deal to
                    say, and winding all the aspects together fairs a great struggle. For it is hard to remark upon
                    things, when
                    you admittedly suggest they are not in the way you use them. But as deductions take things for
                    granted,
                    regardless of merrit, so do those who suppose do the same; in that their observations lead them to
                    principles, or assumptions, which are in accords to an accurate view of the world. Yet the ground
                    still has
                    depths to go. And at heart, it is that tug o war between the course to knowledge, and the completion
                    of it;
                    the latter always being evidently premature, and the former never ceasing course.

                    There seems not much more to life than experience and principal.
                    <br>&emsp;However, each seem to be derived from some deeper truth, and a contested one at that.
                    Namely, that
                    of our experience, so do we mean that which we've observed, or been impressed by. And to remove the
                    confusion of sensibility and objects, let us simply indicate this sentiment as one of relation; as
                    we would
                    describe a balls bounce of a wall, to which the motions fairly lie. For the other, lies the root
                    contention,
                    namely whether the source of our principles and declarations are completely born from experience. As
                    a
                    likely result of experience being the source of said affirmations, so to the limits of our relations
                    lie as
                    the spring for declaration: as not to be stuck progressing throug inquiry. But beyond the motivation
                    and
                    resolve, the point lies in whether or not our principle reasoning is born from what we have already
                    experienced. The Humian in me says it does; at least such sentiments do suggest this. Namely, that
                    of the
                    truth which we proclaim, be it of neccasary motions and conduct, to the meaning and or reality of
                    objects on
                    terms of that, that so does a) the urge to affirm come from our experience thus far, and by that,
                    our
                    incomplete dealings with the world, and b) that what we see as born from the truth (now affirmed) is
                    too
                    bade from experience; nor, and formoest, do the elements and or strides of our reasoning bear
                    themselves
                    from anything other than what we've experienced so far. Indeed, one of the fair contentions is that,
                    albeit
                    true that our sight and hearing are impressed upon by the world, and of such qualities which we'd
                    see and or
                    deem in reaosning, that so would those inputs bear the source of our notions: the material if you
                    will. But
                    it is otherwise said, that of our thinking, in it's varied form, that these are not so much the
                    senses in
                    play, and by that receptors during experience, but rather something innate, intelligence, on par
                    with the
                    deeper streams of nature which we suppose. In a Humian way though, I'd wonder how our regards for
                    such
                    thinking are identified without the contents of our sensible impressions. Is the form of something,
                    be it in
                    color or proportion not derived from our experience with such qualities? And in many ways, there
                    seems not
                    but a progressive dimunition of abstracteness, whereby the subject of our thoughts is not merely an
                    arrangment of what we've experienced, but formed in our mode of thinking. Mathematics seems the key
                    mystery
                    then, for the marshalling of logic, or deduction rather, still uses subjects that bear there cloth
                    from our
                    impressions; while numerals seem inherently abstract. But I would say, that our sense of numerals
                    being so,
                    comes not from our imagining of them, as the vision of 1 or 2 still holds with it some objective
                    form.
                    Rather, it is the relations which we deem, or see mathematically, and the consquent feeling that
                    their
                    reality is beyond objective. In this though, I would say that as we remark upon things of a real
                    sort in
                    such way, as to correspond with proportions and relations, that so do the strides of mathematics
                    merely stem
                    from what is inherent to the syntax. "That if such and such occurs, by the natural relation of
                    numbers,
                    something happens." And by my account, this is itself an observation.

                    matters.
                    And to that I care the least. For violence and tryanny are not clean subjects. But as material, and
                    something which we can relate to, so are the impressions from inappropriate things a detriment to
                    such ends.
                    To be clear, said things are not inappropriate, as in the case of poor behaviour, but rather as
                    sources for
                    seeing the properties of those harsher subjects. For one, these sources are quite oppressing, in
                    that their
                    form is very dense, saturated and expressive. This does not lead to understanding though, but merely
                    a pure
                    digestion of everything they offer. On that, the actual merrit in what they have to say makes this
                    consquence a fault, simply because the quality of their impression stands small besides those of
                    other
                    sorts. Said alternatives not only leave with you a fuller impression due to the conduct of their
                    form; but
                    so does the material hold more nuance and proportion.
                    <br>&emsp;Perhaps, by our younger ways, we were so overt to the common path, that the submission to
                    one more
                    freeing and liberal, held with it an open lane to the farther parts of the world. And from that, our
                    igorance of such matters lead to a mixture of over-confidence, 'as if we in fact knew', and
                    gratuitous
                    contempt, 'where the apparent elments of the world gleamed upon us, but without any accuracy or
                    proper
                    receptiivty (by us)'. And this is why, by our irksome despiar regarding such ingestions, did we
                    lawyer over
                    the inneuendos and promsicuity which we normally consumed. Such things have their place, and like in
                    sobriety, so is it partly pleasing. But our pressue and condition towards the fuller world, hold no
                    bars
                    when it came to awkward insights of it's total elements. And through reflection and honesty, we
                    recgonized
                    that our nomral ingestions were both sourcing the imagery which those foregin ideas were made from;
                    and
                    otherwise rotting ourselves away, as we sought to see the world without being tugged by such novel
                    elements,
                    and better yet define them with proper sources.

                    Let us remain aloft, by doing our vinysasa, running, incorporating pull ups when we can, eating soup
                    and
                    fruit, and trying to remedy our sleep. In order to do that, let us wake up early, bare an incentive,
                    and go
                    from there. As for our leisure, were on the road to hatred, and Landslide (hopefully treating us to
                    t4). I
                    would love to watch Cloverfield (and the mystery of it), and maybe some thriller movies.
                    <br>&emsp;Vinyasa is merely a means for warrior and downward dog. But it seems to our benefit to do
                    runners
                    lunge and twist, then go through downward dog, till wide legged fold, and warrior from there. From
                    this, you
                    do two steps of lunging, with room for a break between. Running wise, our aerobics are the limiting
                    factor,
                    and the concern for pullups need not drag down our ease from running and pushups. Pullups can be
                    done prior,
                    on the lower bars, or in particular; but in the seldom moments their needed, in moments we properly
                    can. As
                    for our incentive, the kashi fruit bars are solid, as is Tofu and ketchup. Soup is pretty easy, and
                    I say we
                    make use of the broccoli. I would not be against some springrolls also. When we wake up, we need
                    some plan
                    for the day. In reality, were going to open our eyes, walk, then go for a scooter and run, then get
                    our
                    food. From there we've won.

                    My brain is burnt, and I'm putt off by everything. I appreciate that our emotions are not so filled
                    with
                    envy and fear; but the former does seem to linger, albeit postive, while the latter still comes up,
                    when
                    something less respected by me strikes our cooked mind.
                    <br>&emsp;All I'll say is that we are a certain way, and from that, open ourselves to thorny
                    impressions.
                    Why we are such a way, time does tell. But as to the form and pace of such state, that is more
                    remarkable.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, the time of my youth was met with a sort of lifeless commissery; whereby the
                    sentiment
                    of school and profession held me in a muted gaze. I rebelled though, recklessly in some cases; by in
                    that,
                    as our turn was not so horrid, so did our neutral state prime us for a different path. For we had
                    always
                    been young, open and kind, but held not grit or delight in the promsie of tradition. As I mentioned,
                    our
                    contarry efforts were of either idleness or gratuity; but so did our environment and natural
                    complexion shed
                    off the harsher sides of this. Leaving me then in a tempered state, I was struck by things of a
                    redeeming
                    sort; in the way that those in struggle turn to idoltray. I did the same, particularly when it came
                    to
                    productivity and prudence. Guided mind you with a modern bend.
                    <br>&emsp;Here though our story lies, for in that wake, we shed off any lingering attention to the
                    properties of norm, and instead burrowed ourselves in to the matters of health, writing, and
                    eventually
                    reason. As it happened, those early days were ripe with vehemence; partly to affirm ourselves and
                    void
                    negative reception, as well as to inbed our simmering passion for a life further and bound. As time
                    went on
                    though, those emtions began to bade, and the eagerness to please and obsess washed off.
                    <br>&emsp;The result though was not one of grand progress, but rather solitude and mute sentiment.
                    Our life
                    was rather ornate in the basest of ways, and our free time and care was laundered by nothing other
                    than our
                    novel pleasantry. The story goes though that we emboldened the latter by reading older texts, and
                    found both
                    merrit and means in our self-goverened way. From this point our life pitched up, but not to any
                    fufilled
                    end.
                    <br>&emsp;You see, that early portion of our formative ways, was one that held a clear villain: the
                    lack of
                    living which would produce depression; and the promiscuously gallant life which we held too little
                    love or
                    fortitude to embrace. By that, it was easy to ignore the future and sink into passivity; and
                    otherwise grow
                    into those reverant ways. Such reverence though did not procure much more than novel satisfaction.
                    There was
                    a large amount, but the world around seemed either intrusive or contemptable. I'd remark the fact
                    that in
                    those days we'd plan everything; from meals to bed time. While our more settled chapters held less
                    reservation to naturally be, as perhaps guided by our experience thus far. But you see, therein lies
                    the
                    change, in which the good which I procucred against the bad of tradition, that so did our
                    'tradition'
                    develop into a full and settled state; whereby we needed no more aversion or aggrssion towards such
                    norms,
                    but rather to simply be ourself in the way we pleased. Indeed, there were lessons, and much of our
                    matured
                    stated brought with it the mud of prior emotions.
                    <br>&emsp;That is however, the concern for the recent past and our coming memories; as such strides
                    are what
                    we'd remark upon in terms of the bearing our past deciions gave. As for those times, it is the case
                    that we
                    sunk into ourselves, and held less occupation by purely being ourself. We had been so obsessed with
                    such as
                    a matter of validation and engagement; propogated mind you by the happiness this brought. But as the
                    heat
                    from tradition died down, and our ease of reaching finer pleasure ensued, so were we left without
                    occupation
                    or ends. Indeed, I found much which brought further light to that path, whereby we saw more that we
                    could
                    do, and by that, further goods we could reach.
                    <br>&emsp;But this soft abandoment of common committments, and our otherwise flourishing through our
                    private
                    governance, brought with it a sort of division regarding possibility. For the good from me has
                    always been
                    enough; and never anything but lacking ourselves and right action, would bend me off that vibrant
                    road. But
                    our place amidst people, time and things while being such way, brought with it a sort of trouble and
                    confusion. For my efforts were such that they could almost naturally procure themselves: I still
                    needed a
                    home though. And by that, our pecuniary efforts saw an expected exchamge between me and other folks.
                    But via
                    our fear of revealing our personal governance, our reservation to be more involved as not to run
                    contrary to
                    such governance --and by that have to explain why--- and our more common and emtional desires (in
                    both love
                    and praise), we errored in finding any broader footing, in both comfort and profession. It was not
                    so much
                    that being ourself was a struggle, or unfufilling, but the basic pressure from being so occupied
                    warranted
                    the deeper feelings that had been covered through our maturing state. But, our efforts to partake in
                    such,
                    and succeed, failed on the count of being as our we were in that governed sense. We never adapted,
                    partook,
                    or spoke in ways that were relevant or effective for the ends our feelings sought. And as those
                    matters
                    failed, we found life restraining, and sought freerer time to be myself. I have learned recently
                    that the
                    means to said feelings is not so challening, or contrary to your goverened self. which is
                    encouraging. But
                    that is merely a remark of our less than free state, continuing to care for the goods of our
                    governance, but
                    with the acquaintences which soothe the emotions which our duties erect. "And our maturing state
                    held to
                    much fear and too little means for relation per our personal state; and so the conditions which
                    sprung our
                    hope for relations and growth remained unchecked, and thus turned us to conditions which were less
                    demanding."
                    <br>&emsp;In other words, we learned to be ourself in a resourefull way upon our abscence from the
                    common
                    path. As the concentration for this left, and our natural gait was of that formed complexion, so did
                    we
                    further enrich such state, and simmer our care and judgement for it's goods.

                    Tradition has lost its stature. The effects of it linger, but so are we merely asked to contend with
                    that as
                    we freely explore.
                    <br>&emsp;Such dispositions of the past hold not much more than a sensible view of the world, which
                    rests on
                    both the function of it, and our surrounding oblige. As we ignore the ucstom of the latter, despite
                    being
                    free to beleive what we want regarding the formeer, so do I find much comfort and peace in affirming
                    such
                    things, as it mends our tendancy to be on our own.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, if I removed the notions tangled on the weeds of mentality, I am left with a
                    fairly
                    deemed concept of the world. Considering the legacy of observation, and the pressures exerted onto
                    the seams
                    of pure reason, I can say that all things seem constant and orderly. By that, our place in the
                    world,
                    orbiting the sun, with plants and man foraging about, so our life lay. By that, I fear no
                    interuption of
                    things, and can remark upon my life as if the things I commonly observe, and know to be present by
                    other's
                    observatoins, are true. I do see the plea for reason, as to rightly know. But our proclivity of
                    thought is
                    one that affords little concern for the concepts and truths born in the past: as such things,
                    despite there
                    fullest attempts, seem to hold their aboslutness in small borders. And my calmet principle, is that
                    iwthi
                    nthe borders that our observations profess, there is neither mcuh which is suggested as our purely
                    reasonable statements would propose; nor, foremost, is there much to concern yourself with outside
                    said
                    borders, which you may suppose. By that notion, I don't deny or refute reason, nor the attempts to
                    bind the
                    modern borders. But there is little merrit I see, in the more animate and customary interprations
                    brought
                    from the past. Namely that they rest on what I can only say is a cesing ambiguity of mentality.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, I can say that our need to affirm, or remark at least baser things, is that our
                    more
                    common actions are so far off, that having a sturdy point from in front and behind, eases our time
                    while
                    doing so.

                    I turned my head as my time as a boy was ending; and the direction of my gaze peered inwards, and
                    happily
                    so. Prior to this, my time had been either reckless or somber, and the resolve to mend both seemed
                    out of
                    reach, or uninteresting. As a sort of boiling point occured, I amended to what I was drawn to, and
                    that was
                    myself.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, the proclivity for such cares were such, that by the inportance which
                    self-regard
                    brought, I was wholly prepped to converge with such. Upon doing so, I worked myself through efforts
                    and
                    tasks that were a benefit to me personally, be it in prudence or calm delight.
                    <br>&emsp;As the years went on though, our discipline began to settle in, and our need to attend
                    things
                    became less about focus and managment, but rather letting it naturally happen. But as the norms of
                    our gait
                    turned, so were we left with little to attend. We warmly felt the heat of our inner glow, but
                    without the
                    deeds to tend the flame, we felt unoriented. In effect, the common obligations we had began to feel
                    more
                    like burdens than provision. And the result was that the goods which our disposition proccured, felt
                    intruded upon by those civil tasks. Resulting from this was a barron appeal to some route that
                    seperated me
                    from such mundaneness. But this resolve was fruitless, and we were left with nothing else but our
                    self, and
                    the civil norms.
                    <br>&emsp;From this point I realized that our need for things could not be met outside civil
                    affairs. I
                    turned my head towards things which would afford more excess in the things we needed, and more
                    simplicity
                    and fulfullment in the means to them. This part of the path though did not lead to success. As it
                    were, we
                    were well in our intent, and quite able to achieve something. But by our behavior and choices, we
                    did not
                    follow through. And as these aims were subject to our adolescent character, so did our care for
                    romance and
                    friends equally suffer.
                    <br>&emsp;Time then began for me, in that I questioned little of our happiness and its appeal; but
                    the
                    stability which this was propped on held not but a dim light. There was just something about having
                    to
                    provide for the things I cared for, that had me filled with envy and shame. Reasoning that our ends
                    justified the mundane means felt hard to convene with; if only because such reasons were too
                    private, and by
                    that, hard to share. As it happened, we spent our time fiddling and meandering, trying to find
                    acceptance
                    and fortune, as to bear our simple needs a simple furnishment. This did go well, and these years
                    were not
                    short of positive. But the truth, is that nothing but our momentary grace ever came to fruition. And
                    despite
                    having a range of dreamt and firm predictions, so were we merely alof on time's current, never set
                    or
                    ordained for anything beyond. We simply settled and sat at the point we were at, letting our
                    fortuity and
                    felicitiy grown.
                    <br>&emsp;Upon this age, where we found ourself, and thereupon the solidity of its frame, so have I
                    struggled to fill that form with any constant amount of living. You see, life is hard to particpate
                    in, as
                    the candor of her sides, albeit bright, hold a draining effect by the surrounding amends to her
                    stirn
                    requirments. I always morned over our need for such affairs, as the cost of them seemed so protuding
                    into
                    our calmer delights. That, and the nature of those delights were such, that all I needed was the
                    meagerest
                    means to sufficiency. But our mature state did not afford us anything more than the admission that
                    we needed
                    satiation.
                    <br>&emsp;From this day where I now live, I have learned and grown, dreamt and reflected; and here
                    and now,
                    in the greenest of places, we have not but a lingering amount of weeds. For our time and ways is not
                    ordained to far off fancies, nor the crushing defeat of our overly stirn regards. We have moulded
                    ourself to
                    care, in a way that remarks the world in all her depth and light; a way that holds me accountable to
                    both
                    her promsie and place, via actions which our common, needed, and affordable. By that, we need not
                    dream of a
                    time when our sweet delights are free for us to tend to; as we do not see this as realistic, nor a
                    misfortune. It is true, that life demands that you breathe, eat and keep warm. Nor does she permitt
                    you to
                    acheive this nasically or happily, without the abilities and slant of man. But our time in the
                    recent year
                    and days, has shown me that our shortcomings have purely come, from our ill treatment of our own
                    portion of
                    that slant, and the fufilling process of being both stable and fed in the whole of life. To much had
                    our
                    aims been garnered on the goods of reason; yet such a manner was not fully stated, in either a
                    mature sense
                    of the world, and our appropraite requirments. As a boy we held no belief in the common end; but to
                    another
                    we did not know, and thus go. We turned to ourself; but it is fair to characterize this as someone
                    finding
                    joy in not; or at least delight outside a path. Truly, the fruits of that became the path itself.
                    But this
                    is not what we feel is offered by reason, nor what we find true in reflection. For the goods our
                    governed
                    way are not so as to be comeplte in themself; but rather as an assortment of scents and flavors that
                    blossom
                    upon our stride living. For no bad day cuold cease enough to prevent our calmest cares being met.
                    And the
                    moral, or lesson rather, is that the goods of reason are merely those which formed on another of
                    life's
                    path; one which holds its candor and hues to all her sides and shades. And from that, our insight is
                    that
                    the steps we take, and to the glimmer on the horizon, is such that of this path which reason exacts,
                    so must
                    we take it as if it were the path were on.
                    <br>&emsp;Indeed, the part of our writing which lies like an iceberg under the sea, in part lies in
                    the
                    matter of defintiion. But such elements are merely there as a means of binding against your
                    inefficency. For
                    it is not one in motion who must reflect and treat, but those who fail; as strictly, they have done
                    so if
                    being is no longer bade. For that is what reason is for; to orchestrate what you feel and expect
                    based on
                    your past and place within nature. For however she is, and what we wish she'd be, so are our motions
                    fair
                    and finest, when they can be ordained to be so, as the world accepts. And quite literally, all
                    actions are
                    such, that they warrant reproval, if upon use they elicit the hault of being. And so, as time can
                    finely
                    exclaim, that tradition, naievety and an otherwise wordly progress, garners a need to iron out the
                    effects
                    of imperfection, to bear clarity in how your proceed imperfectly, and otherwise remark on the goods
                    which
                    make it worthwhile to progress to. For it is all too easy to abide with whats common; as such norms
                    feel
                    laudible by there lasting prescence. But life is always changing, and the standards of now are but
                    the
                    deeper strands which life has not yet woven out. None of us really act in the way that those in the
                    1800s
                    did. Nor do we see things fundementally as those a millenia ago. But despite admitting the contrast
                    of the
                    former, and the differing norms which our standards now reflect, it is in those of olden days, far
                    back in
                    the faintest history, that still hold a basic thread; one of which our own deepst cares and beliefs
                    reflect.
                    And one which, upon a mere honest observation, can over time be shown to leave nothing but scarrs.
                    But as we
                    don't do what those in recent centuries did, for such manners seem immediate in their antiquation,
                    so is it
                    those deeper threads which take time to iron out. And the fairest way to succeed this, is to

                    So the world is more or less a certain way; and of the way it is, so is there a way to be. It is
                    worth
                    noting that a natural view of the world, no matter the colors or proportions, is more or less
                    assumed. If we
                    do not assume it, then it seems better to look past any practical matters. Or, at the very least, if
                    nature
                    was in fact all dual and loopy, ought we define the elements of our oblige in such accords. "For it
                    seems
                    wrong to view things in a certain way, all the while we hold our standards in a different light: the
                    two
                    ought reminsicen one another."
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, of the world and how she is, it is important to note that our view of such is
                    drawn
                    primarily from how she seems; and as such, we deem our amends based on what such view amounts to.
                    Only, this
                    view is mixed between sentiments which are present and lasting. In that, our sense of things may be
                    born
                    from beliefs that have thei heritage upon the beginning of time. Or it may be something that is
                    newly
                    contemporary.
                    <br>&emsp;In all of this, I see much importance in simply illustrating the scope of things; and by
                    that,
                    having but a point of view, that perhaps sees both sides, but then merely inclines. For I do not
                    know much;
                    as the deeper nature of things is both a matter itself, and otherwise obscure is its depths reflect.
                    Nor do
                    the definite strands of the world afford much reasoning for which our natural inquiries obsess. But
                    we may
                    rest on the observations we do have. And considering that much of what we believe sits upon
                    surrounding
                    sentiments, so may we remark the points of we which remark some, of the deeper sort maybe, all the
                    while we
                    oblige the specifics which derive from such sides. For instance, if our view of family is born from
                    the
                    roots of civilization, then our current sense may simply spring from that direction. But if we hold
                    more
                    anthropoligical sentiments, then so may our ends seem differnet; considering the possible pitch from
                    points
                    further back. Despite the compaisons being somewhat absent, I simply wish to say that if you are
                    going to
                    consider farther points, and by that simplify more recent ones (which we might have seen as being
                    relativley
                    far back), that our otherwise further regard is not itself a marker of truth, if only because it is
                    further.
                    It is fair to think that the further back you go, the more narrow the points become, as there are
                    either
                    less; or those which are there, are so that they have been precisley seen; for things so far back
                    would not
                    otherwise be deemed, if they in fact were not seen. So past the edge of common concepts, there is a
                    cohesive
                    bend to most observation. If we applied this sentiment though to the remarks of nature herself, then
                    we
                    might say that our descripition of things, for instance the universes simplicity, would be a
                    perspetcive
                    amidst others, each hovering around a shared point; the perspepctives being a variation of
                    concpetion and
                    understanding (theory even) of a piece of evdidence; the nature of which, holds not much more than
                    the
                    doubts of measures and submission. So upon verification, we may simply vary in terms of what we
                    think.
                    <br>&emsp;On this note, I would say that our modern permitt to view things naturally, permitts us to
                    consider our efforts via the truth of our personal world; and thereby not the one which governs the
                    whole.
                    In a similar light though, the idea of life, and by that the candor and process of it it's way, is
                    comparable to the borders of our 'natural view' and that of the depths below. In this case, we'd say
                    that on
                    the natural end, wherey observation stacks ontop of that obscure frontier, that so the microbes of
                    Archeon
                    lay. Indeed the border lies between the geology of the Hadeon, and that of microbial fossils in
                    early
                    Archeon. It is prpphecised that polymers, a sort of medley of moleucles which blended, led to the
                    early
                    forms of that which would become microbial. Of this I do not know; and of the relation and
                    resemblence to
                    commonly known cells, I cannot say. But what I would then suspect, and bend to, modern sentiment
                    surely
                    consigns.

                    So, not to get in some knots, considering the comparitive points I spoke about, but we might benefit
                    from
                    just creating a natural line.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, we're in agreement that our humanity is born from the planet, and it is a self
                    contained
                    system within the nature of things. By that, our being as man is marked by our lineage as apes, and
                    the
                    consquent development from the various stages of man. Despite being characterized by our use of
                    tools, the
                    bulk of these stages can only loosely describe the deeper elemnents which we generally remark as
                    human.
                    Namely, language, memory, imagination, along with the social formations which governance and custom
                    refer.
                    These elements, albeit sourced from an age ago, hold their prominence in the recent three hundred
                    thousand
                    years. Indeed this may be granting too much; as per our notion that the compleixities of man, at
                    least the
                    arrangment that gives such qualities any prevlenance, that so may the primordial forms of these have
                    remained till much later. I am willing though to say, that by 100,000 B.C, that we were more or less
                    governed, similar in manner to current day indigenous tribes. Nor was our language so ape like, but
                    more
                    elaborate; differing perhaps in that it was not so refined; but able still to be particular. And it
                    seems a
                    fair tenant to suggest that the more concrete and definite motions of our mind blossomed in parallel
                    with
                    language.
                    <br>&emsp;In terms of family, the root of this holds its baser form millions of years ago. Mammals
                    in
                    general hold some motion which reflects a family; a parental harmony at least. Where the discrete
                    mention of
                    this though comes in, is when our behaviour becomes more clear and deliberative; whereby our
                    engagement with
                    hunting for instance, comes about with communicative forthought and reflection. The conduct and
                    relations
                    which motivate and manage our family is similar to that, as are all kinds of relations: family being
                    a mere
                    portion of that.
                    <br>&emsp;But indeed governance comes in, for the purpose of family is accompanied by the efforts
                    which were
                    obliged to greet. In terms of relation, governance is a sort of commisery and custom as to
                    collectivley
                    facilate such ends. And by that, the need for family is mixed with the novel interest one has for
                    it, and so
                    the latter committs amidst the needs of governance.
                    <br>&emsp;At this point, we are left with the question of neccessity, as family pertains. And in
                    esscence,
                    there is a side to this which feels essential, namely in the continuation of man. But the origins of
                    these
                    happenings hold a distinct place when compared to our modern times. Namely, in the way that our
                    collective
                    functions, and how the motions of old derive custom. For in that far off way, the concerns of the
                    many was
                    in their collective means for shelter and satiation. And as custom was pillared upon this, in both
                    the
                    agreement of folk to partake, and the aim of authorities to commission, that so would the purpose of
                    family
                    lay; in that, as if an neccessity on the basis of propogation, but seperate in kind from our need
                    for food,
                    that so were each, in their basic kind, consented on collective need for this. This was the soul
                    lens at
                    least.
                    <br>&emsp;In modern times though, the proficiency of man, in his stable continutation, sprouted into
                    points
                    of progress, whereby the primary objects of older times (and their governance) could be amended with
                    less
                    concentrated points. The pillars remained, yet less folk were require to hold them up. And by that,
                    more
                    could do as they please: and the custom folded around such freedom.
                    <br>&emsp;We may speak of culture later on, but I would like to mention the advance of our freedoms.
                    For
                    just as the pillar of satiety needed the whole to erect, and the agrarian advents which allowed for
                    success
                    without every hand, that so in the following millenias were other frameworks developed; not only to
                    a point
                    which further stationed the basic pillars ---of both an original and novel time--- but to an end
                    which was
                    full of pillars of a pleasing and kindred sort. Engineeering comes to mind, in that enough hands
                    were free
                    to erect the Pyramids of Gyza; or the mere splatters of tech, in masonry and printing. So upon this
                    did the
                    world birth an economy, and firmer stations of people as remarked it.
                    <br>&emsp;From this though, lies the hearted question, namely of our needs amidst said economy, and
                    the
                    deeds to bide it. Generally, it is hard to say, for the assertion of any sentiment requires an
                    elegant
                    proposal. From where we've come, I'd say were on track to exlaim the present: but such statements
                    are what
                    need to be done, and bringing what we know and what we now see is quite hard to do.

                    So consider two populations of people, or governances rather. Each may be a hegemon, or empire; they
                    may be
                    ruled by a king, a minister; and more likely than not, they are seperated into provinces, kingdoms
                    or
                    states; and better put, the arrangment of these amdist one another, be it federally or the empire,
                    remarks
                    there total status.
                    <br>&emsp;Now, generally speaking each form compares in the orientation of crown and county. Where
                    they
                    differ is in how sharp the point is, and how broad the base is. In any case, if there is a conflict
                    between
                    both blades, then subjects within the base are called up to fight; be it to blunt the other knife,
                    take some
                    of its base, or merely defend the same interests of the other. As it were, the destruction caused is
                    usually
                    to those involved in the fighting, and those amidst the figthing grounds. Generally speaking, the
                    back lands
                    see little damage, while those on the front receive the most. If there is conquest, then so may the
                    path
                    taken by the victor lead to damage along their route. More often then not though, upon their cease
                    of land
                    or crown, the subjects of the defeated state become members of the conquerer. Their status may not
                    be as it
                    was before; and almost surely their custom and ways will alter. But beyond the loss of those who won
                    and
                    lost, so is the time ahead slanted up.
                    <br>&emsp;In terms of conduct, the horror of conflict lies in the trauma one recieves. There may be
                    fiendishness, strict laws and according severity; or there may just be censors, curfews, obdience
                    and
                    according custom.
                    <br>&emsp;What is important to note though, is that good and bad occurs in the heart and minds of
                    people; as
                    are crimes committed to and from folks. A community though, suffering instance over the loss of a
                    neighbour,
                    is merely a emotion shared by those who held similar relations with the one lost. If only one person
                    knew
                    them, and their feeling was such, a grievence within the community merely marks a broader amount of
                    people
                    who knew.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, we can define one's actions as particular to them; and along with that, that
                    such
                    actions were defined by the depth of such path, as opposed to generalizing across the norm of more
                    than one.
                    In that way, a solider is made aware of a conflict, goes through recruiting, travles and initates
                    themselves
                    to the operation, trains, is transported, begins their service, as a mechanic, medic, artillery
                    officer or
                    man of the front. And for each, their path is such that, be it a battle in the evening, or a
                    skirmish at
                    noon, that upon its end, and by fortune's gain, breakfast, lunch and dinner lie. Nor does rest avoid
                    them;
                    and if nerves, trauma and fear grind them to a sigh, then so do angst and boredom occur. Only, while
                    they
                    are amidst their post, near or far from the cliff side. And as for battle, let us just say that a
                    man's
                    service and pain is earns him respect, and affords him pride. Nor in injury or violence, is he home
                    to any
                    but himself; and by that, subject to anything but his character, heart, courage, and is candor and
                    hue for
                    action. Not a shots been fired, nor a hit recieved, that was not of one ill-fit for this
                    description.
                    Someone though who took pains to inflict more upon others, or cackled and smiled at other's hurt,
                    such makes
                    a fiend. And indeed, I say all of this, for despite being well spoken of the groups and divisions
                    which
                    partook in such conflicts, it is almost absent of any to really know path of any given man. And from
                    that,
                    as you lean back and adjust to your own humanity, and otherwise step down the tracks of actual men,
                    you
                    realize that what is likely so and common for all men, is not so fiendish, nor anything short of
                    civil; but
                    merely law being executed, and foreigners being spat at. But any hurt delivered to them, is but
                    arsenal
                    being used for the operation, or the severity of penalities which policy exhibits. And none hold but
                    a
                    seldom mark from the pity establishment of modern and stupid men.
                    <br>&emsp;At heart, man is but a wandering animal, happy with others as he is with the comfort of
                    food.
                    Indeed, it would seem fair to say that part of the warmth he feels to others, is in the confidence
                    they
                    bring him in his pursuit of goods and things. Such desires are furnished by the support other's
                    offer. But
                    as for the path he's actually come, so is this hard to chart. And less we remark upon things in the
                    most
                    basic of ways, then our ignorance will hault our inquiry. For it is not true that man was so, then
                    governed,
                    then economic, but rather they were men, each with a name, or being, with a nature that had them
                    convene.
                    And from that, by the heaves and hoes from Erectus to congress, so has there been not but a day,
                    where the
                    minutely furthered slice was experienced. Bit by bit the days grow, to the point where a novel piece
                    is
                    fitted. But we are truly part of a massive puzzel; and as to remark the truth, ought one only in
                    time use
                    the biggest pieces. Or, if they do as the world is now, hold little speculation and stateliness, and
                    be but
                    general as the world seems present. Then even, how thick is each piece, regardless of the single
                    layer. For
                    the names of countries do not encapsulate them. Nor do the words and ways of their governent express
                    the
                    conditions of their people.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, the world is always in a moment. But in extent, the pieces in play are but
                    systems of
                    their own. And each of these holds with it a sort of structure and quality, of which one ought not
                    generally
                    suggest, nor the other being summaried and in fairness forgotten. As it were, how things were and
                    how things
                    are, give us insight to how things should be. But predicting the future holds with it a great demand
                    to be
                    thorough in your statement. For if the world is full of strucutures and objects inside them, then
                    the future
                    state of the world will simply remark the arrangement of that. If the present then, and winds of the
                    past,
                    speak to the road ahead, then so ought the complexion of that road, as we'd only care to know, be a
                    scale in
                    which our basis for prediction stands on. "For it is foolish to look up from a world which holds a
                    thin form
                    and empty substance, and expect to likely see a point ahead with otherwise qualities." Furthermore,
                    it would
                    be unnecassrily astute to claim that our predictions should be of the world as it fully is, rather
                    than we
                    thinnly imagine. And if so, then the propiety of our present statements is laid, and the scale for
                    whether
                    or statements are meaningfull at all. For the future is important indeed, but if your proclomations
                    are
                    sprung from a small view, then the end which you see is seemingly worthless.

                    The economy, being a result of excess, holds in it a sort of potential; in that by industrial means,
                    folk
                    are not only subject to the riches of the economies state, but able to produce.
                    <br>&emsp;For the way an economy works, is that attention can be paid to developing goods and
                    service.
                    Because this requires time and care to faciliate, people can sell their efforts; and those managing
                    the
                    venture purchase it with a wage. The modern economy though also permitts more and more people to
                    begin
                    ventures; be it in craft or art. For a venture is traditionally one of exchange, in that a resource
                    is
                    manufactured for consumption, labored by those who earn wages to produce, and purchased by those
                    who's
                    seperate income permitts their interest to buy. But the means to this can be translated into
                    ventures which
                    are less of industry, but creation; namely in printing, visual arts, and the modern variations.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, the modern state of the economy is such, that people may cultivate an
                    equitable
                    fortune, in that their efforts can be servicable, rather than compensitory. Alongside this, folk may
                    invovle
                    themselves in such ventures, as laboroers fit for this creative venture. This is where the trades of
                    film,
                    media, design and games come in. And indeed, if one initiates a pursuit of film making, and hires
                    those to
                    work, so may those people partake in the ways of such creation, and bolster themselves for future
                    creativity
                    --of an equitable sort.
                    <br>&emsp;By that token, I mark our lingering interest to play and create when it comes to gaming,
                    study and
                    film. And because of this, the craft of video making seems a draw. Moreso, when I look at our life
                    in terms
                    of needs, and the according earnings we seek, so is there a course for investing in our means,
                    namely in
                    that of video/media production. For such lanes hold the side of things which I care for, and the
                    genersous
                    interest I imagine. This seems then like an oppertune path, as it makes use of the creative
                    industries
                    within the economy, and our skills and relations within the field which I'd wish to create.

                    In this way the world lies. And per the economy, so are we in but an elabortae form of the orginal
                    system.
                    In that case, there were pillars which had to be held up everyone. Eventually, less were required,
                    and more
                    could attend to other things. From that, new pillars were held up. As time went on, the mode of the
                    system
                    changed to a principal excess, whereby the arrangment around food and shelter was but a baser layer,
                    upon
                    which the relations of commerce and leisure ran. It seems that we are still in it, having changed
                    only in
                    the means by which new pillars (of goods and service) were made. And indeed, the baser governments
                    held some
                    sort of custom over commerce, as to make it fair and equitable: both in labor and exchange. In many
                    ways,
                    the purpose of government was in binding the pillars that the collective held together; and the
                    economy is
                    but a higher layer which people partake in; and like a well which everyone brought water from, so is
                    the
                    governmetns an equal faciliator in the pools of commerce.

                    So home sentiment is fair. Mom is almost absent with content. Our dad appears to be unhappy with me,
                    but our
                    efforts have brought some content. And the fact that we've tried to find jobs, and are in fact
                    applying,
                    polishes any rough edge.
                    <br>&emsp;For now, our own time is what matters; for we need some strenght to try and or see, and
                    otherwise
                    accept our place and proceed in it's standing. Were just nervous through our idleness then.
                    <br>&emsp;Sleep is the gravest concern. We did have some sugar recently, and the impact was not
                    insignificant. But right now our sleep is a concern. Were staying up to late, and foremost, were
                    sleeping
                    in. There is to be fair a drain of reason from our circumstance; but so would we have natural
                    inclinations
                    if our habits were better.
                    <br>&emsp;This is why I consider preconceived plans. Beyond our leisue, I mean to sign some sort of
                    agreement, as to convince ourself to get up. If only to contrive our day. The struggle though, is
                    that we
                    are not simply encouraging ourself with tasty promises. Rather, something to have at all. There's
                    not much
                    which feels special though; which I can see at least.
                    <br>&emsp;Were just off cycle. We need no permanence at 7, but a return to norms near 8. For our own
                    activity is ultiamtley the concern; for if were groggy in the morn then our day will move slowly;
                    nor will
                    our evening stand up to consumption. And being up with the day shows a sort of prescence at home,
                    and thus
                    leans us away from scrutiny.
                    <br>&emsp;Perhaps our life could offer us the proper path; for if we knew what we ought do for that,
                    then we
                    would not need to prompt our purposless interest.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, I see far ahead, in our oppertunity to partake in the modern industries, and
                    thereby
                    bolster ourself for personal living and future relations.
                    <br>&emsp;There is not a dear amount for us to work on though, but rather make decisions which carve
                    us down
                    that path. Indeed, we could be at a different point now; for we are not at the moment occupied. But
                    depsite
                    seeing the reality and stability of us as being in line with that, so have our past decisions kept
                    us from
                    anything outside our precadence to this. We have not but what we may soon have. And our effort has
                    not but
                    been in vain. And our trajectroy is merely working towards success. For now, what is critical is
                    more near
                    and personal, namely of our sleep and conduct. There is much which I hold in kind, but our energy is
                    relatively off.

                    From what I know, there is a both a dream and means to creating things online. Life is not so wholly
                    from
                    doing so, but there is a novel appeal, and practical advantage.
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, the greatest barrier to entry is in consistency. For if you wish to validate
                    your
                    channel, grow it, and earn from it as you find your stride, then you will have to post. This is why
                    picking
                    a niche and formatt which fits your capacity is essential. Making a podcast could be alright, but I
                    don't
                    think I want to make 50 of them before I make a penny. Shorts on the other hand, particularly on
                    plump
                    platforms like Tik Tok, can be oriented in a lasting bulky way. There's no guarentee though. But it
                    is worth
                    noting that your progress and familiarity will bring you to consistent points of satisfaction,
                    anticipation
                    and humility. "I recall our first videos to hit 600 views, and how good that felt." Our videos
                    weren't
                    terrific though; and if the material was the core element, so was it of something old.
                    <br>&emsp;One of the oddities in all of this, is that none grant you a reward, nor prevent you from
                    gaining.
                    In some sense, the motions of users on a platform are what determines what is subsquently met.
                    Strictly,
                    those who have come hold a clear relation for algorithms to suggest; moreso, are people who have
                    been
                    already noted as being a certain way, and so by a users perceived interests, so are such creators
                    eligble
                    for suggestion. "As they are the sample lot which users are pointed to." That is why niches are
                    important,
                    as you make yourself relevant within a certain direction, for those who, typically have such
                    interest, and
                    are otherwise noted by the alogrithm as having such an interest as (meta-noted) which you are a
                    source for.
                    Make your stamp then, as you warrant yourself the chance to be seen.
                    <br>&emsp;In that way, the core argument is one of platforms. For engagement is not itself the
                    economic
                    issue, but rather of exchange; which econmomics is built on. But there is little doubt or reasoning
                    which
                    requires regard for the profit of exchange, as the basic means can facilaite that. What matters is
                    the
                    engagmenent. This stands on the function of a platform, and thus the persistence of such operation.
                    Facebook
                    for instance, despite being around, functions quite differently than it did before; and thus the
                    proper
                    oblige to its system has changed. Youtube is generally what it's been, and Tik Tok also remains the
                    same.
                    The latter though, for instance, is rewarding longer form videos. Which is but a newer side for
                    creators to
                    lean on. More impprtantly though, is the longevity of Tik Tok as a platform, and whether it will
                    remain
                    present in our country; or at least, if so, whether it will keep to its current function.

                    At the foot of society is a sort of collective commissery; namely, towards the purpose of needs and
                    satiety.
                    <br>&emsp;Government, and custom, is that which forms around the strenght of such union, in that
                    upon a
                    stable conidtion of such gains, so is the binding of it admitted. You might imagine this as lonely
                    wanderers, merging together to support the other's travel amidst the grasp for sustenance. But as
                    enough
                    come, or at least some reliability is gained, then like a pillar erected for stability, so around
                    the folks
                    surrounding doth culture and custom lay.
                    <br>&emsp;Upon this point, the matters of water are attended. As food being essential, and water
                    being
                    randomly got, so by the settled communion --by virtue of the steadyness of food (that all to moving
                    substance)- that so the steadyness of water lays. In a well perhaps. Better said though, around the
                    essentials which afford a governed communio, that so are a) those essentials maintained and
                    improved, and b)
                    other pillars erected. For man needs more than food, but also shelter, custom, production of tools
                    and other
                    means. And so does a richly simple commune lay.
                    <br>&emsp;As time goes on, people notice other things. As if upon the pillar of food, that means for
                    reliable water were gained, that equal to the search and industry for that, were other things found;
                    things
                    which could be added or used for improvement. And by this, the ocncept of buildings came about,
                    along with a
                    novel dispersion of tools and goods.
                    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the space between everyone producing and buying goods, and those being made as
                    mere tokens
                    amidst the simple ways is unclear; for how did any have money or means of exchange for such goods?
                    How could
                    the labor required to extract and manufacture be ordained without compensation? Even if someone were
                    a
                    cobbler, a blacksmith, a watchmaker or cook, who held any means to purcahse them? The spring for
                    economics
                    needs more specifics.
                    <br>&emsp;We can say though, in general terms, that amidst the foundational pillars of the group,
                    new ones
                    were laid. These amounted to advents in culture, profession, and the goods and activities that came
                    about.
                    As it were though, this line of development furthered to the point where points of exchange littered
                    the
                    land: a true economy.

                    I have always been happy, and aimed for it. Our life has not been but a required garnish.
                    <br>&emsp;The toruble in describing this though, is that there are needs, and beyond your
                    simplicity, so are
                    you without a grip on such things, out of control: for you either freeze, or seep the warth from
                    another.
                    <br>&emsp;In that I can say, or at least I could recount, the choices I've made. But right now, all
                    I see,
                    is that even if I were to garner some stability, that happiness would be my sight. For the thing I
                    know, is
                    that such goods are all you do, or ever will seek. For it is what remarks the stride of our moment;
                    and by
                    that, the warmth which your life brings for. This is why, when we are sapped from heat, we dream and
                    amend
                    for such success. But the happiness we see is really one of imagery and pursuit, rather than
                    experience. I
                    would not say the things we anticipate are poor in making us happy; only that their worth is in the
                    happiness ahead, rather than the passion your feeling now.
                    <br>&emsp;This is where I lie then. For much of what I feel makes me happy is not, on inspection,
                    much
                    different than what I can imagine. Foremost, is that the giddy excitement I have of some exocitc
                    end, is not
                    of more worth than the actual end is concerned. And the thing we forget, is much of our pleasure
                    comes from
                    the sight of such experience, rather than what it will actuallly confer. For I too feel myself
                    setting
                    sights on things, feeling elated; and otherwise relishing the fact that of such fancied sights, we
                    can see.
                    And our depression comes when such sights are gone.
                    <br>&emsp;It is all so important though, that what we care for now, is in many ways what the future
                    is
                    promsied on. Only, the character of it changes it's hue, thus drawing our passion towards something
                    so
                    apparently vibrant. But the fact is, that the granduer of that image draws us more now, than it
                    would during
                    the moment. Better put, and my point, that the good from that experience is so on the balance of its
                    elements: but such a balance is not what we imbued with on approach; for in that, the very idea of
                    something
                    is what energizes us, and our view is whats pleasant. That, and the very prescence of a view,
                    affords us a
                    sort of barrier from depression and apprehension.
                    <br>&emsp;My point then is one of wisdom. As the good that our view brings, to me, seems not what
                    the
                    present will then be. For you will be there, having to experience things. Indeed there may be a
                    arrangment
                    of work and feed which allows for enjoyment.
                    <br>&emsp;I just don't value much on the promise of things. For I don't feel that the present is
                    lacking
                    those things, but rather a harmony with what is available. I think we forget a) the work required to
                    reach
                    our dream, b) the continued maintence of it, and c) the value of it once it becomes something were
                    apart of,
                    and d) once it's over, we simply dream of more, or settle ourselves in, and be happy as our fortune
                    permitts. And this latter, to me, is not to be averse to. But I think it is essentially on par with
                    what you
                    can currently be.
                    <br>&emsp;Our approach in life has been such, that of one, we at one point withdrew. And from there,
                    assimilated to a purely happy being. Here the tits and tats of leisure came to brew, along with the
                    bones of
                    self-regard, and the cheer from our world view, and seeing her grain and hues. It has been like a
                    grove,
                    where the leaves were shining, or paled with blue icy frost. And the sun, always setting, to a moon
                    which
                    comes to rise. Nor the birds mellodies amidst the heat and wind, or the flushings of a squirell. The
                    grass
                    is soft, and there are slopes which give a slant view of the lands and sky. And indeed, though we
                    must treat
                    it, is there shelter, full of satiable and crafy ends. Theres not but peace and prosperity here.
                    Though we
                    do spend a bit to much time in the surrounding forest.
                    <br>&emsp;And so now, I feel on the backs of tradition, and otherwise set to relieve this gasp for
                    breathe
                    which comes ever so often. I don't wish to put myself in this place, nor do I want to avoid the drip
                    in our
                    comfort which comes from ordaining another. But I have, in our fortune and dubious ways, founded a
                    mine of
                    calm delight and joy. And our sights ahead, as the sap of comfort compells me, is not to a new mine,
                    but
                    merely an array of motions --be it expanding or stabilizing-- that surround the current spring. It
                    needs but
                    additions, in both the rafters and company. For I don't truly consent, nor admire, the fancied
                    elation to
                    adventure, infamy, posterity, and gain. These are but the prospects of one unfamiliar which the

                    portions of nature. Things of which don't linger in their good upon completion; but instead draw
                    more.

                    The difference between fammily and relationships, is in one, your duties are based on what will
                    cultivate
                    connection, but not neccessarily permitt it; while the other is, in a role, servicable, and thus
                    needing
                    your to provide: and for the sake of that, earn.
                    <br>&emsp;I will have a family some day. But our condition is such, that of the relations which
                    would
                    procure that, I either don't care, or don't lack. While the matter of children is such, that even if
                    I had
                    the requisite partner, I may not even need to be extravgent in my procurement of that; and
                    considering the
                    further need as to garner a child, I could still work for that. And I am resting on the definite
                    aim, as
                    would come about in being considerate with my partner. For we would both excite the prospect of a
                    child from
                    one another, define it, and resourcefully amend.
                    <br>&emsp;For now though, I have no such quest. Nor are my aims of relations and correspondance but
                    of open
                    regard, and confidence through the mere means (including communication) which afford them. "I feel
                    fine
                    desiring such things, in their ordinary means and ways. We need not starve ourselves of such
                    elements,
                    despite our simplicity."

                    The oddest force in the world is money, as you must work for it. Nor do things worse buying come
                    cheap. And
                    even if you could afford it, there's not much in a single experience, but one whose pleasure extends
                    through
                    your life; and as such, you ought procure money consistently, as to purchase things often.
                    <br>&emsp;But the thing I find is that such hopes are built on rickety foundations. Simply, when we
                    are
                    lacking, we dream, and by that, find passion in things which can bring us there. This is from an
                    ungrounded
                    or satisfied customer though. And in effect, wisdom fairly suggests, that upon realizing your hope,
                    that you
                    will simply wish for more. Mainly in part, because of the thing you seek being a mere experience, or
                    some
                    preferred ordinance in your living: the highest being king.
                    <br>&emsp;These do not prolong your experience though from the moments invovled, but only the
                    search, your
                    grasp, your success and achievment. But where does happiness lie if not in the living? Dreams seem
                    but an
                    antidote to a current lack of happiness. The principle though is that what strikes you about your
                    discontent, will not bring you content upon arrival. For the candour of what you seek is that it is
                    opposite
                    of where your currently at; and the contrast brings your gaze to some brighter horizon: the peering
                    of
                    which, marks your passion and claim. But not what actually lies at it's edge: for you must actually
                    do as
                    living requires, and that which offers content. Or you will simply seek more.
                    <br>&emsp;This discretion, or prediction rather, is merely here as an admission to our cares within
                    living,
                    and of finance. For if I had all the money in the world, I would go to India, Bengal, China, and
                    perhaps the
                    richer parts of London. But these hopes are but tingling inclinations, buzzing from dreams of the
                    past.
                    Indeed they never come to fruition, as either aims or the according resolves; but their moments do
                    leave a
                    sort of lint, and carry thus their seeking smell.
                    <br>&emsp;By that, I would rather clean these off, then have to humour them as part of our amends.
                    For they
                    remark what I would call 'an idle state'; one of which, fairly by nature's demands, and less so by
                    our
                    fiddling oblige, comes from our sedition to dutiful ware and monotony: whereupon we tiredly dream,
                    'for who
                    wishes to be so tired and stuck, and set in it'.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, my interests are grounded from self-observation, and the similar dualism to
                    nature's
                    claim; whereby we hold the elements of amends based on our propiety, and those of reward. This is
                    but a root
                    though, a sort of personal bank of pleasure and security. For we are a man, and by that subject to
                    the
                    world. Only, our intent is not to fancy our unbridled inclinations --to Bengal. As mentioend, these
                    are from
                    an instable state; and not likely absent if our personal bank is empty. For we may be nieve in our
                    surface
                    level ways; or we may be puffed up from our youth, or simply with angst in our less than glorious
                    positio.
                    There are an assortment of ways as to why we dream, and proceed either with confidence or angst.
                    Wisdom,
                    though not with disdain, merely remarks what's vain about this.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, I ought balance our current wares with that which is expected of me. For our
                    civil
                    state is such that little is needed: but some still. And so our abscence of much bears disharmony.
                    Per
                    tradition though, we are not so needing of parlay. For we may wish for chidlren, in a predictable
                    sense; and
                    that of partners and friends, etc. But our distance from these things is like one's seperation from
                    political contribution, or cultural definement. These are the seeds which get blown upon a blossomed
                    spore:
                    and by that, a prominent man. "To much do I see a prevalance of the former, without the traits of
                    the
                    latter. Or, if those traits are prevalant, their to fixated and focused, and lacking of the
                    effortless charm
                    which a lush prominence produces." Family is equal, in that, less you seek meaning, or feel
                    compelled based
                    on reaching now which is eventual, then so are you actually preparing, or on approach to such
                    eventuality,
                    by the natural rise of your prevalcne and character. And as the world heeds your offer, so doth that
                    of one
                    whose hand you take: and to those you tend to. "It is a fine principle to state, that of such
                    attention,
                    ought I have it in both quality and extent."
                    <br>&emsp;In all of this then, there lies the things I find dear, and those which we'd describe as
                    part of
                    our life. The former has been spoken of for years, and the reason for our prominence in such regard,
                    is also
                    its own line of reflection. Where our life has struggle though, is in the strucutral side of things.
                    Our
                    invovlements, friends, genuine contirbution. These things have garnished my efforts for an age it
                    seems. And
                    never, beyond the insight of failure, have I succeeded. It is true that our cares and attempts were
                    off
                    tiler; likely because our pivot point was from deep within. Indeed experience has shown me how to be
                    from
                    that base; nor is it without much strenght to try something new. For I can almsot mold what seems
                    uncertain,
                    with similar portions and light as those which I now see.
                    <br>&emsp;Plainly speaking, I wish for some friends. Perhaps they will not share our care for
                    personal
                    reason and reward; but so in our leisure can we compare. Near this is public invovlment, namely that
                    of
                    recreation. In these, we bear the benefit of itinerary, speaking, vulnerability, along with social
                    potential
                    as pertains romance, partners, relationships and friends. Indeed, having a job fixates me and thus
                    draws me
                    to these ends. It is also benefited by doing them. Similarly, finding other means to communicate, be
                    it on
                    forums or specilaized sites, can offer an equal amount of relief and attention, like recreation. As
                    such,
                    these elements orbit eachother, and afford one another harmony; in that by being there, each is able
                    to
                    accept the requirments for itself, lean in as to exhibit committment and the according stability,
                    along with
                    a sort of pleasure, in that each can happily see the point it provides: and of this, others offer,
                    in that
                    they bolster the ware and tear of those around, and at the very least allow them to make their
                    point, and
                    relish it. Nor is the fact that such point becomes easier and rewarding a lesser remark.
                    <br>&emsp;As we said, our fears are not such as tradition would see me; nor are our visions of
                    grandeur and
                    reprieve either prominent or consented. But our life is on track for something. Even if it is more
                    moderate,
                    and not dissproprtiante as our visions concieve. By that, I simply wish to correspond with our Sums.
                    The
                    folks to which I'd share are clear, and equally relevant to the sentiment I'd express; and that
                    which I
                    would express is concrete. Our writing compares, though is less definite. And, in propiety, our
                    interest and
                    contribution are heralded here, as we may simply offer a modern take on the mind, God, death and
                    morality.
                    This indeed is our great painting; one of which our current portraits relate. Our children are
                    similar, in
                    that they are the offspring of our current attentions, be it ourself, a job, a partner, a friend.
                    <br>&emsp;I will submitt that our idea of contribution is warped by a fractured view of the world;
                    notably
                    born from TV and screen time. These things just melt my mind; and even as the years have gone on,
                    and as a
                    source of refutation and validation, our otherwise impressions still leave me irriated by what I see
                    on TV.
                    And as so, our common remark is that when our view of the world is guided by study and experience,
                    so is
                    there not what we gleam from TV. But when we do watch it, our fears and elation are instated; and so
                    our
                    duty and oppertunity consent. In that, all I can say, is this very fact of confusion and display
                    from the
                    televised culuture, moves me to offer some truth, or deep expression. There is room for this, and
                    indeed I
                    find it fufilling. In the same way as one paints about death as to remark there grasp of it, so is
                    our wish
                    and or incline to be on TV, or express ourselves publlicily, an equal amned, in that we grasp our
                    feeling of
                    the world. But the world does not strike me as needing change; as death does not spurr in you a wish
                    to
                    alter it, but mend to it. I think that a better way of viewing this, is that as death is there, so
                    is the
                    world. And by not expressing ourselves, be it through writing or expression, we get weighed down by
                    it: as
                    some feel in there grief about death. And the side of our world view which is subject to colorfull
                    expression, only unerves our insecure state. "While one's fear of death is not prodded by others
                    expression." As such, I'd say there an educational offer one could make as to afford the ease from
                    expression, and the fair impression to others. Different to this is the need to express as to remove
                    your
                    irriation: whereby we similarly refuted other's view of death and validated our own. Only, in that
                    case, it
                    being so private, meant the proper course was one which remarked your own. The world is not so
                    different; in
                    that, of death, despite us dealing with it all, that so is the primary force one which remarks your
                    experience with it: and to that, your reflecting amends. To the world then, ought we proceed
                    positively, as
                    if we are tailoring our own needs. Truly we could iron this sentiment out, but I'd say for the
                    moment, the
                    idea that we'd share as to sturdy ourself, and in by that happily effect others by impressing upon
                    them our
                    pure expression, makes the affair both personally and publicly satisfying.
                    <br>&emsp;Last in our remarks are the matters of work and correspondance. As the world draws me to
                    express
                    myself, like the force of death, so am I compelled to submitt what I write; as such words are a
                    summary of
                    my dealings with life, and thus expressing them feels formitative. Whereto I do not know. And
                    Indeed, there
                    seems a difference between the mere message I'd send to a professor or forum; and that which I
                    actually
                    procure, like Descartes and Kant. I don't mean to be a writer though, like Rousseua; or Hume even.
                    Indeed, I
                    might benefit an acquaintence with something similar to forums, but in a more concise format for
                    essays.
                    Still, I wonder if our thoughts are better kept as written, and not constructed as those submissions
                    would
                    need. Per the future, I would format my words as to be readable and seen: and in that declarative.
                    Nor would
                    the clearer ideas of Sums be in need of much more than demonstration. But my doubts of death and God
                    seem
                    but private triflings. And easily so; for the wear upon our life draws these mentions out, but the
                    deepness
                    where they lie, and the ripples which the surface elicits. But our steadyness lets me be pleased
                    with said
                    things dear. As remarks work, so is this simple, yet complicated due to aims. For the matter at
                    hand, we are
                    talking about some sort of profession or skill, and all for the sake of money. Only, as my dear
                    efforts get
                    ruffled by surface tension, so does our care and aim for work get rippled by fear and desire. And,
                    as I sit
                    with a clear head and course for action, so do the lingering threads of those sentiments blurr our
                    otherwise
                    content. "Why are you choosing this I say? You won't earn glory, fame nor the means to travel." When
                    this
                    conflict comes up, the work at hand feels more like a burden then satiation; as we feel drawn to do
                    more,
                    and thus the current post is both limiting, and a cost of effort while we work for something more.
                    And the
                    whole venture feels like a drag. In the sense of expression though, you may seek to create content,
                    or be
                    invovled publicly through forms of media. And by that, per our course, so may our skills and
                    invovlement
                    lie. The question though, is whether we learn a skill to leverage, or amend to a path which affords
                    skills
                    and oppertunity; one being short term, the other long.
                    <br>&emsp;What I want is perhaps the mitigating factor. For working little is enough, and sufficeint
                    for
                    what is near and plenty. But, novelly, or of passion, I may seek travel, be it domestic or far.
                    That, and a
                    more plump and ordinate means for living holds itself some favor. In part though, if I remove the
                    harsher
                    sides of fear and delight, then I am left with what could reasonably be, and fairly beyond; but by
                    means
                    which I cannot see. Seemingly, our buiness is a sure curator of such goods, but in correspondance
                    with it's
                    success: and as such, its exhibition of success as a buiness: by which, as one, we must neccessarily
                    amend.
                    Skills may be otherwise garnished, or novel employments; which may be found through simple
                    oppertunity and
                    positions, or by some eligble offer and training. This seems to benefit only the conduct of our
                    work, not
                    its privilage. For if I did go to Thailand, the Atlantic, so would I need a reliable means; and one
                    which
                    I'd be fine doing. So experience is required to secure a familiar standinbg amidst online labours.
                    As
                    regards craft though, besides creation, there is the old way of education. I see much beneift in
                    having a
                    bachelor, as you can simply write. And earning so can likely be done cheaply and swiftly online: but
                    the
                    three year committment is hard. As it were, diplomas and certificates hold no clear route to income.
                    They
                    may afford potential, but no direct eligibility, and thus privalage. Online training seems fair,
                    though the
                    balance of skill and community seems split; in that for one the means are cheap, the other
                    expensive; but of
                    the former, it is unneccessary to have the format which affords the latter: but so are you left with
                    the
                    abscence of what said latter would provide. It is not entirely true that to find that community that
                    you'd
                    have to pay; but there is much of it which you do, and the value is merely there for such effect.
                    Moreover,
                    the less direct you are in the community, means that you need to be more impressive to enter it;
                    which
                    requires creation, rather than skill. If you simply have that, then you are left with a wrench and
                    no
                    client, nor means to attract other workers. Balancing this with broader skills, and potential
                    variety in
                    oppertunity, does afford some reason to invest. But perhaps each scenario is unique, and as regards
                    its
                    price and value, ought you merely be open and curious, as to find, consider and see. All the while,
                    noting
                    your interest, in that you could work online, with a team, for creation and the good; and through
                    that, by
                    the means of video, audio, graphics, color and design, along with Javascript, media management, SEO.
                    "The
                    oppertunity will be in a company or team looking to hire, based on skill and specific ability; such
                    as
                    moderate means in Javascript, as to clean a website: a digital clerk of sorts. Or to actually
                    perform a
                    task, such as edit a video, or create some flyer. That, or to work on a team as an editor."

                    For many reasons, our interest in success is dampened by our happiness and stress. For we can't
                    really see
                    ahead; or we simply dream. But as for action, we tend to get riled up, as if our state in life is
                    probing us
                    to do something rewarding. In the moment were drawn, and can see how well we'll do, and the objects
                    which
                    our success is born from.
                    <br>&emsp;As I settle though, and our happiness comes to be, and our fears flatten out, then so are
                    we in a
                    less elated state. And our view of success is less defined in it's means and ends. As such, our idea
                    of the
                    things we'd do to succeed, hold less promise or confidence; in part, because our view of the end,
                    and the
                    passion stirred in me, don't draw out the view of the means, as to be broader in its form: and
                    thereby
                    evaluated on the way it is at heart, rather than its near and discrete proportions.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I land then, is that from our experience, this part of the path were on is one that
                    either
                    turns away --settling into the content we have-- or proceeds for elaboration of that happiness; but
                    in that,
                    focuses little on the fertility of the project itself. Rather, it tends to be consented to if the
                    form of it
                    is sufficeint, as to afford our creativity and solid base: but not one which is overly attractive
                    and
                    dazzling: which is to say, 'it need not be as a project would want, if it were meant to yield us
                    success,
                    but simply what our generoisity can work from'.
                    <br>&emsp;Right now I am in that state, where we are too happy to care, but inclined also by the
                    sense of
                    duty ahead, and our worth from doing so; and the desired relief from such duty, and its spurr of
                    richer
                    amends. But such amends are not so enticing when are need for them is meager. What I will say, is
                    that in
                    this current rendition of future regard, we are higher than we were before. And as the wave of
                    interest ebbs
                    from passion to past times, so is the bobbing nature of the latter of a relatively complex sort. Or,
                    in
                    short, what is sufficient for creativity is in fact dazzling. Though, when I look at our work, I am
                    not so
                    dazzled, but merely impresed by the strenght of our elements. But little of its excites me, as even
                    the
                    simplest complexion would in a passioned state. So there is a natural flattens to our confidence.
                    Even then,
                    I still recognize the wholenss of our work, and its fit for broad appeal. Theres no heat to this
                    recognition, but as our wave of content bobbs upward, so is our novel desire enstated. "For what, I
                    do not
                    know, but of the basis, as would serve our ordinary worth, and the bobbing fancy to make it
                    something more,
                    for the further gleams of fame, or the nearer wants of reward, so are in total drawn."
                    <br>&emsp;I wonder though what such a venture would be. For the marks of elation are quite easy to
                    make, as
                    all seems good when the future seems so clear and prized. "For we will no matter the route make it."
                    But,
                    even if in our relativley solid contentment, and the more faded view of our work, so am I more
                    inclined to
                    see a reason to do it; and by that reason, form our brand and title. For it would be easy to say
                    'dailyTips'
                    or 'GreensTavern'. Something quick, impersonal and catchy. Then there is another, where we say
                    something
                    personal, overt and obscure, like 'TheMason', 'GreensBounty' or 'JoyWantWonder'; something which was
                    meaningfull to me, and esteemed as something which only those in the group would know. Somewhere in
                    the
                    middle though, there is the remarks of reason and living, along with the nature of this being a
                    channel,
                    with a form and some guided plea for other's attention: something which demonstrates what one could
                    expect,
                    in both the routineliness of our content --hence DailyTips-- and the material of that --be it
                    misties

                    from

                    the begudgement of the latter. But so did we acqueise to it, and find reaosn and worth in it.
                    <br>&emsp;But as time went on, we were to keen to leave it; either out of relief, or by some
                    oppertunity to
                    do so. And now, when we have nothing, nor the means to find it, were somewhat stuck.
                    <br>&emsp;I would say that snetiment attrats upon you via a restless state; in that those who would
                    deem you
                    as unworthy and need if discontent, merely do so in a pointed way: which gets flared up by your
                    actions.
                    <br>&emsp;For perhaps their view is ruffled, and thus they forget the past, and fear the future: and
                    judge
                    you accordingly. But as time goes on, and your response to their treatment is affible, then despite
                    not
                    filling their wish, so are the senitments cooled, leaving not but practicality.
                    <br>&emsp;I don't think I have an understanding, which would afford mere allowance for easy
                    progress. But
                    there is room for me to try, whiff, and merely proceed. For that, we have oppertunities: but they
                    are not
                    final. Nor are there many routes with clear paths to them. But we are not so averse to trying, or
                    seeing
                    them.
                    <br>&emsp;One of the great assurances, is that where we mean to go, which is all that matters beyond
                    our
                    current vagrance and communion, that such a place has a variety of means, each surrounding one
                    another, and
                    by that, offering potential changes for the sake of preference. As I see now though, it is hard to
                    image
                    about such potential, when you have nothing for now. The point, is that despite a future with
                    ideals, so do
                    you need somewhere to be, however unideal. And indeed, what would be permissible in that is quite
                    broad, and
                    there are options. But time and direct effort seem the only promsing means. For everything else
                    seems blown
                    into the wind. I can widen our search; but really to things which you can be direct about. Emails
                    are always
                    preferable, as is anything which you can communicate directly. But for now, we only have two
                    walmarts and
                    Superstore, each of which seems likely, if not promising. And per the holiday, we need only tenure
                    our
                    family sentiment, remain open ourselves; but thereby remain upright, live, be.

                    So tomorrow is a good aerobic day, plus a little ride into Hammond and Fresh Co. They've get
                    Bananas, A
                    bounty of Springrolls, and some potential for quinoa. Tomorrow is the last day of 2016: finish the
                    frame
                    traps, last podcast, game of year, and any replays: then it's onto the switch.
                    <br>&emsp;Diablo is fine and plenty, and we have reached t4. We need to figure out the Kurast City
                    and
                    Mercenaries, for the resistance they give. Besides that, Sly 2 seems fair following tomorrow. Path
                    is
                    coming, and I don't mind the 40 bucks. But our life is a little unclear right now. Like it's quiet,
                    too
                    quiet. Mom is coming on Friday --which means a 2 day break. And at any rate, there has been little
                    contention or slights. We are waking up early, and seem to be doing well; so that may be part of it.
                    I have
                    to confirm, but as far as I can tell, Superstore, Poco and Ridge Walmart are all an option leading
                    into the
                    New Year. I am applying to Craigslist adds as well. But there seems not much more than that. I am
                    fine with
                    those prior options, but the time for them is after the holidays. Sentiment seems on our side, and
                    so
                    perhaps we can settle; with balance though, to keep steady and respected, and also for ourself.
                    There is
                    much ease and fun in doing so. Sly was great, as is Arthur. Allies are in the heart of an age, and
                    practicing Yin is quite enabling.

                    So just a few remarks, coming primnarily from a talk on Hume. Namely, that in terms of formal
                    reasoning, ie.
                    logic and math, or better yet propositions, there is not requirment, or fair expectation, that
                    anything
                    within said phrases ought actually exist. You may have three connected points; and it may be
                    demonstrated
                    that the angles are always 180*. Better yet, considering a set of conditions, you may deduce much
                    from them:
                    but that the objects which we are speaking of, with such conditions, do not neccesarily exist. There
                    may be
                    no triangles; or things with that relation. The propositions are merely formal and or abstract. One
                    may ask
                    how we get the elements to use in the propositions; and in terms of mathematics, the buisness is
                    seperate
                    from other objective matters; in the sense that, of a bachelor, who is so if they are umarried, that
                    so may
                    there not be someone who we'd describe as such. The question though, is despite there being no one
                    who meets
                    that condition, has there never been? And if so, how can we make such a conditional statement,
                    considering
                    that the subject of the statement is supposedly unexistant. Similar to math, whereby we attribute
                    values and
                    relate upon them, that the idea of a bachelor is used upon the value of a person; meaning some
                    generic and
                    or abstract object of that kind; a kind which can be more or less dervied from the experience we
                    have with
                    it. But we might then as easily say, that a person who is 8ft tall will never exist; and we surley
                    haven't
                    seen one, but the reasoning perhaps for the logic does not require that we do. The reasoning may be
                    strong,
                    but in a formal sense, hinges little on whether an actual person has or will be of such condition.
                    In some
                    sense this is the question, for the meaning of a statement tends to come from its place in the
                    world; and
                    thereby it's impact upon us, had we listened to it. But such an amends usually comes when the
                    statements are
                    based in, and spring us to action, via matters of fact. For if a person cannot be a certain height
                    by the
                    impermissibility of nature, then so is this logical reasoning quite obsucre from matters of fact.
                    Both in
                    the form of the proposition, in that the grounds for it are not (we'll say) based on matters of
                    fact, but
                    mere qualities which bear themselves as possible via the physics of being, 'anot not so much what an
                    actual
                    person is'; as well as the real results of the statement, that they'd be more than merely valid, but
                    true,
                    or real rather.
                    <br>&emsp;Where I lie then, is wondering why knowledge is of worth? It would seem that my
                    inclinations for
                    it come from similar source which inclines me to more apparnetly deisrable things. Not so much that
                    my taste
                    for sweets sits alongside a similar pallete for insight, but rather, in my remarks at least, as I'd
                    suggest
                    my interest in such common desires, that so would I say that I seek things from knowledge.
                    <br>&emsp;But in fact, I do not know what I seek, for the basis for what I would, is not something
                    that
                    really serves me. At least, in a modern sense, what I can not attribute to higher motions, or
                    functionings
                    rather at the surface of nature, that so in those deeper sways --where real knowledge lies-- so is
                    our
                    abscence from it without ware and concern; nor is the prescence of it much consolation. As my fears
                    and
                    deeds tend to come from observation and experience. And much of what I see in myself, combined with
                    the
                    collective insight of the man, brings little care in me for things that knowledge is traditionally
                    sought
                    for. My mind is not some seperate entity, and a mystery at that; nor is death some experience which
                    has any
                    reason to be feared of; rather the notion of soul, and afterlife, are but the ends which death is
                    proposed
                    to be an entry to: and of such ride, I do not think much of the facts which describe it, nor is it
                    one which
                    sallies the natural content I have in death.
                    <br>&emsp;In whole, there are many of us who act with a sort of unity; but also perhaps, with an
                    eventual
                    forward bend, as what you propsed as true, and acted by as if you knew, becomes less taughitble, and
                    the
                    concreteness of your view gives way to a glaring need for change. "And immaleability feels the
                    weight as it
                    is asked to reposition." As such, there has been a history of denial, formalism, scrutiny, and
                    otherwise
                    complacency when liberty is in fact present. For all I seek is to live in a way, that my labors and
                    delights
                    are tended to. This is almost in line with my peacefull grace while respirating, and uncontrolable
                    gasp when
                    there is no air. That as such, so do I honestly remark about the quality of my experience. And in
                    that, lies
                    what is best described as a sort of liberty, in that I can either act or suggest something which is
                    out of
                    the norm. When I do so though, and feel the heat from standards, so do I a) refute those standards,
                    so I may
                    look forward without being pulled from behind, or b) state my own standards, as to cement myself
                    ahead on
                    the new path we've found, and it's end which were on route to. "You can't simply deny the false
                    beliefs of
                    others, but find one's which are true. And indeed, the orthodoxy of those falisites can interfer
                    with your
                    interest in finding better ones; and like a sickness which would cloud the eagerness and ability of
                    our mind
                    (to wonder and pursue), that so is the removal of friction a similar thing: at least in this we are
                    dealing
                    with it with the medicine of defiance and rebuke."
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, I see that our life as beings, is best described by conditioning. For things
                    which
                    act in a system, and in fairly complex ways, hold but a mere banking towards certain motions; but in
                    the
                    composition of there being, as oppsed to the fairly straighforward motion of a particle, there lies
                    a medley
                    of particular motions; each pointing as direct as the other, or any finer piece for that matter; but
                    by
                    there orientation into a objective system, so do the composed motions, or unified sum if you will,
                    resemble
                    that of gravitation, whereby the attraction of 2 piepces is merely the same as an indivuidal, but
                    being
                    exerted by two indidivuals. Ie. the effect is in the portions: but where lie together, merely
                    exhibits that
                    portion in a larger way, via union, or rather combination. As for the reason that things exert what
                    they do,
                    and are in the combinations that we see, it is whole and fair to suspect that, beneath this apparent
                    complexity, there lies a deep abyss of simple homogenity. Even though the truth in the matter is
                    unknown,
                    that so is it a fine principle that, despite this deep comparability, that there is in fact no
                    isotropy; and
                    that it is more likely the matter that, of that deep and rising tide, that the meagerest of
                    differences
                    eventually compounded into the complexiites we see. One might view this as a one mile pole which
                    slightly
                    started to unwind, and near the top, exponentially loosened and strung apart. The illustration
                    though, is
                    one that is better viewed like a tree, in that the rise of comparability reached a point where the
                    differentation merely broadened after a long period of time, and in a hasty manner. I'd fair this
                    concept is
                    not to hard to see, even if my explanation is a little parched.

                    I would reflect that our choices have brought this moment of lethargy, but I can't pinpoint them.
                    Likely
                    because our timing was a bit off yesterday, and our activity wasn't so robut. Namely, we had
                    springrolls
                    early, and did not walk between 2 and 8. Our legs just feel stiff though, and they weren't so
                    yesterday. I
                    am not unsure of the route forward, but as for why I am as I currently sit, is unclear. At any rate,
                    learning more about yin and recovery is fundemental, as our midday rest is pivotal. There are some
                    great
                    twists so far. Agile running is a great way to open up, and sutain a brief yet hearty aerobic
                    session. And
                    our strenght finds it way as our endurance increases. Though its natural rythm get's squashed from
                    our
                    indolence. It's not that I feel narrow, but drowsy, with some heaviness to our rigor. When there is
                    room,
                    try slotting in some downward dog and leg raise practice, in order to straigthen out your spine.
                    Runners
                    lunge and warrior have a good flow and place. Though I feel a little spread out in our efforts,
                    partially
                    due to the cold and its impact on our food making and walks.
                    <br>&emsp;At any rate, I feel most comfortable in our future environment. For being stable, holds no
                    drain
                    on a potential lack in quality, as there are positions around it which can routinely provide some
                    potential
                    change. Too, the elevation of our means and satsifaction, and the decrease of weight and tradition,
                    balance
                    out all conditions; and naturally allow them to adjust.

                    The meager truth is that our occupation delves us away from contentment; and pins us into the sense
                    that our
                    actions are either burdensome, or immoral.
                    <br>&emsp;Why ought this be? Is it because of our life, and the instability that we've procurred
                    through
                    frugality? Is it all likely that the minor amount we need, and are given, is restrictive due to it
                    being
                    held by others.
                    <br>&emsp;What I've found is that, for our benefit, the contempt we receive by those giving, is
                    really aimed
                    at our direction towards the ienvitable things in our life. At least we are bade to question whether
                    or not
                    were on the path to that, or are simply relying on eventually beginning. Perhaps it is our way and
                    age, and
                    the seemingly far off point which we'd concern. Yet, no caregiver wishes for delays, or comfort at
                    the
                    expense of the future. There may be a misunderstanding as to what that future is; but even in the
                    strictest
                    sense, they have a point; for we are not on route to such end, but living as though it is not so

                    So I sit here, fine, free, and more or less happy. I contend to the environment around, and our
                    personal
                    position with respect to it. But this is not something for me to run to, but assimilate in terms of
                    something deeper. For if someone tells you to grow up and focus on your life, then lists what such
                    would
                    amount to, regardless of the merrit in those suggestions, ought you still focus on your life. In
                    that,
                    reckon the importance of your life, and if the way you ought live it is unclear, then find out. But
                    if your
                    waiting, then your never going to feel set, or accepted.
                    <br>&emsp;In many ways, my dearest consent is to that of a family. I just can't imagine that we
                    won't
                    someday have one. Considering our time a decade ago, I can only imagine where we'll be another from
                    here.
                    And so it being eventual is not some derailing factor the present, or anything seemingly nearer. But
                    there
                    ought be a path. For we may find personal privation and amends fulfilling, but they will not bring
                    you to
                    that final place. And so, for your own sake, and that of what lies ahead, ought we live further and
                    more
                    meaningfully.
                    <br>&emsp;Where life lies in a balance of regard, whereby we remark our choices thus far, and the
                    potential
                    which lies ahead; and then the future which we see from a point we'd already describe as happy,
                    wherein the
                    path ahead is not one where we'd now try and succeed, and thus have the promise at hand, but rather
                    a sight
                    to what it all means: as if we'd already won. For it is easy to admitt your mistakes, or at least
                    recognize
                    where your at, and which choices could afford promise. It is another to see, beyond practical
                    insight, what
                    lies in terms of your life entirely.
                    <br>&emsp;We sit then as one already pleased, and quite content. But when we are sprung to regard
                    the
                    future, by virtue of our instability in the present, I see but the little awkwardness which our
                    choices have
                    earned us so far, and what we could then do to amend. And indeed, the sight of this, however near,
                    still
                    fills me with a sense of grounding, and by that a blend of delight and apprehension. Perhaps, from
                    these
                    feelings, lies the sense of what is beyond, as if to fixate the draw the nearby future has. Only,
                    I'd remark
                    that as our current stability is not as tilted, and we retain the insight of the future, while being
                    as
                    pleased as we were, so are we left with a contented view of the future; and in that, a brodaer
                    regard for
                    it. "It is as if we were asked to solve a problem, and upon doing so, we learned about the nature of
                    said
                    problem and said solutions; but in the process, the issue lost it's effect, and thus laid there as a
                    drifting regard for the time ahead: while we sat and rested. Only, our mind is still sat forward,
                    and our
                    contentment isn't one of stability, but time."

                    Continetal philosophy traps itself in the process of identifying things seemingly external, via
                    internal
                    sense. For their being so unque, or external, adds a sort of property to what we'd otherwise see it
                    to be:
                    for we are internally seeing it, and thus, via the means of such sense, that the absolute view of
                    something
                    is from our internal conception: yet what then are we seeing, if not the non external, yet
                    'impressed' view?
                    <br>&emsp;For me, this affords me a sort of inquiry which I'd described as 'contintla progression'.
                    Simply,
                    we live as though the ontology and being of things is paramoubt, and observation is but a
                    resemblence of
                    something truer: the actuality of possibility. But, when we ultimately designtae our impressions as
                    seomthing seperate and dsintxinte from what we see, then so are we cutting ourselves off from the
                    knoweldge
                    which inquiry brings. Simply, concern your senses as equal to and on par with the objects you see;
                    and
                    remark on them as interactions within a total system: your impression being a term of that. In that,
                    ought
                    we simply be in the neccessary state of progress and inquiry, as to understand all, when there
                    appears so
                    much mystery and difference, yet, less we are of mind, then all is ultiatmely the same. "And inquriy
                    allows
                    us to remove the blockiness of this paradox"

                    As it were, I have a progressive model. Fundemntally, it believes that all phenomena can be
                    explained by the
                    motions of existence, but describing this is both troublesome and obsucre.
                    <br>&emsp;For one, the basis of such statement needs subjects, or objects rather, to be used as
                    parts of the
                    motion. For we are stuck otherwise in a dialectic, whereby our inability to identify one thing,
                    leads us to
                    remarking upon an entire whole.
                    <br>&emsp;And indeed, breaking the barrier of this obscurity surrounds the goal of our inquiry. For
                    if we
                    are left with a proper sense of how things appear distinct, yet act in a unified way, then our
                    proposition
                    will be sound. "The way to think of it is in a sheet of fabric, whereby it is all stitched together,
                    and by
                    that, entirely bound. There may be linens though, or fibres. And the polishing of regard we need, is
                    to not
                    run the latter notion into an infinitely plural/piecemeal notion, nor an entirely whole fabric
                    notion."
                    <br>&emsp;The strong sense I have, is that the fabric is more or less whole, but is able to fold
                    whilst
                    retaining substance. And via its ripples, so do complexities lay. The question though, is why it
                    folds as it
                    does; and not just in general, but particular to each point? At least, the apparent distinctions of
                    things,
                    in terms of either properties or localle, suggests some non-uniformity, or isotropy rather, in the
                    spurr for
                    being.
                    <br>&emsp;No matter, our idea of this is beyond the current remarks in physics. It is true that such
                    regards
                    could better really explain the esscence of waves and thermodynamics, and in that, diffuse even the
                    basest
                    of reasons to explore further. "Indeed my need of consolation is already whithered away." But I
                    can't help
                    but remark that our current views on things, and the clarity we seek, is still apt to linger past
                    the surest
                    contentment with our physical view. For I do not know God, nor death, or mind, nor living. And
                    despite there
                    being little which our explanations cannot afford, so is there still an ambiguity, or disregard, for
                    being
                    on the whole; and by that, there seems little grounds for imploring views that run contrary to how
                    those
                    subjects are traditionally seemed.
                    <br>&emsp;By that though, it pays an arm and leg to understand the process by which said things are
                    viewed.
                    Namley in the form of propositions. Here deduction lies, but not so by conditions, or laws, but
                    rather
                    principle, or neccessity.
                    <br>&emsp;And indeed, the progressive model is one that means to ask questions, and by that, assume
                    less
                    certainty than the proponents of something absolute; all the while we establish boundries, as to at
                    least
                    know, within all fairness, how something is with respect to what we already know.
                    <br>&emsp;And all inquiry is, is in establishing the simplicity of those boundries.

                    <br>&emsp;Simplifying our exercise and food would go a long way. For one, remove smoothies, and just
                    have

                    just
                    grab one, and perhaps another, withotu thinking. Tomatoes, Kale and some nut mix well as breakfast,
                    and any
                    assortment of bread and grain fill the night. Adding salt to our broth also makes the sauce a
                    delicacy.
                    <br>&emsp;Rule one should be to bring some prana and warmth to your training, as to do your poses
                    better.

                    So when we were young, we found little interest or reason to strive; nor was it too pleasing or
                    healthy to
                    smoke and slouch.
                    <br>&emsp;But in our resolve, we left for certain matters whch truly drew our mind. Only, the
                    motivation
                    against the opposite was not clear. For we felt principally off while in college; and our health
                    during
                    couriering was strict. But I recall seeking a better job, and being excited. Perhaps, if memory
                    serves me
                    right, we were sitting in our car, considering whether we wanted the new job, or if we would stop,
                    and more
                    or less priotize ourself, and some effort with Justin. I choose the latter.
                    <br>&emsp;And from there our entire life changed. For we stopped worrying about schooling, nor were
                    we
                    fraternizing with destruction. Rather, we focused on ourself, and in a relatively strict and
                    vehement way.
                    <br>&emsp;Doing so felt like a sort of condition, as if we were ordained the constance of attention.
                    I
                    recall telling my parents that I would forever live at home; and by that point, five years ahead
                    seemed like
                    an eternal abyss. And our sentiment was that we were going to reach such end. I remember trying to
                    convince
                    them, by saying we'd watch house, write, read things of the eastern sort. And there wasn't much
                    resistance
                    to what I said. Not very much understanding surely, but no conditions on our intent.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, we sat on the back deck, during the final days of the warm sky. And I recall
                    sitting
                    in a lawn chair, looking up at the blue, and feeling a sort of dried air inside me; but in that, a
                    sort of
                    harmony, unity, a sense of proper living. This moment was not rich in the ways that our later years
                    would
                    be, but the form was comparable.
                    <br>&emsp;It was not till we moved to Coquitlam that I referred to such sentiments, namely the mind
                    and the
                    self --while reading Osho. In that, I became incredibly aware of the portion of me which exhibited
                    desired,
                    want, and ego; and the other which expressed integrity, strenght, ourself. "Left for the latter,
                    right for
                    the former."
                    <br>&emsp;It was only till the year after that this complexion turned to real things; as if I had
                    discovered
                    the measure of experience, and only had to appropriate our actions to things as to produce such
                    experiences.
                    In many ways, our life has not left this motion, differing only in the extent of our observations,
                    and
                    choices subsquently made.
                    <br>&emsp;Right now, we are feeling the abscence of things, which would normally ground me, and
                    allow me to
                    be who I uniquley am. As it is hard to converse and say that you are not working, going to school,
                    in a
                    relationship. "Imagine if they knew how much time I put into defining friends, and chilrden: or
                    death."

                    It seems the right thing is to properly be. Our definitions though of what this entails holds the
                    line of
                    differnece. For some rest on the laurels of logic, and use concepts and abstractions to weave a
                    perfect
                    harmony. While others refute this, saying that the properties of said concepts are not
                    representative to the
                    world. Those who say otherwise, then refute the emperical basis of such critiques, citing the
                    inability to
                    know anything truly via the senses.
                    <br>&emsp;There is a loose thread though, in that the alterante truth which we can know is deemed to
                    be from
                    our mind, or that which we can truly attest. And in effect, there lies a very blank page of reason;
                    a sort
                    of pointed medley of principles and doctrines: all void of everyday matter. "But then applied to it,
                    as if
                    it were a scale."
                    <br>&emsp;The primary concern in all of this is that the lineage of this thinking has produced a
                    sort of
                    pessimistic view of anything alteranative. How could there not be some eternal good, some sort of
                    animating
                    spirit which brought things to accord; but also a will within man, as to permitt his rightous
                    obediance to
                    such good, and thus make him moral: for what else permitts, or brings one forward in and through the
                    concept
                    of eternity.
                    <br>&emsp;The issue though is that the contrast to this sense is not well defined. For beyond the
                    complexion
                    of each side, the former is still endowed with the musts of logic. For it is true, that if there
                    were a
                    good, and a will, that so would the latter be proper upon its alignment with the former. But who
                    says there
                    is anything of the sort? It is true that the conception of nature holds some mystery, and by that,
                    it is
                    concievable that our baser views of her permitt the streams of abstractions to be. But the plea for
                    there to
                    be so feels unfounded.
                    <br>&emsp;In short, there is the matter of truth, which in the common sense, is undiscovered. But so
                    lies
                    sentiment, or one's reasoning as a motive to produce an end which seems conducive to the proprted
                    view of
                    nature. And I would say that the abstract view of nature has no reason to be so, less we believe
                    that an
                    alternative is poor. But the definition of an alertanative, where there is no logical basis for
                    things, but
                    merely the arrangment of nature thus far, is one that holds room and plenty, through living and
                    death.
                    <br>&emsp;As an appeal to Hume, our wishes are ingrained to the elements of the world, and find
                    their
                    preference in real things. Nor is it fair to suggest that the form of those senses, or linens
                    stained by the
                    world, are not either a) of the world, or b) made as such as to be of a form via a relation with the
                    world.
                    "As in the relative motion of things, bringing mechanics to be via relations, rather than an outside
                    force".
                    <br>&emsp;This is the problem you see. For the aim of heaven does hold a scale of morals and virtue.
                    And
                    from that, a measure of good behaviour. But the sentiment of heaven feels like an idea that is made
                    via our
                    time in existence; at the very least a concept which our struggles in existence procurrs, and nudges
                    us to
                    reckon, or remark. "Equal to our thoughts being compared to someone else talking."
                    <br>&emsp;As a sort of progression, we may say, that in critiquing something, and stating something
                    holder
                    more truth, that so will the values established of that falsity be tampered with also. For if it
                    isnot true
                    that there is heaven, nor a lord, then so will our feelings and amends regarding that be deemed
                    falluable.
                    <br>&emsp;My feeling, is that the abrasive response by those who deem such a criticsim as either
                    cruel or
                    unfounded, simply have no regard for what good there'd be in an otherwise truth. Notably, what the
                    reality
                    of death is, and what measure of behaviour ought there be with such truth in mind.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, we can color this discoure with some finer complexion. We are rational; at least
                    we are
                    capable of words and speaking. In that, the confusion of life, its tradtionall remarks, and ours
                    current,
                    lead us to say what we would; in that we remark upon whats been said, and what we think is worth
                    adhering to
                    now. In that, we are left with the mystery of how the world is; namely in the oddity of sensation
                    and
                    matter, considering the very diffuse form of nature. That may be considered the micro scale
                    question; while
                    the macro scale is concerned with the apparent complexity of things, yet via a rather homogenous
                    basis.
                    Better put, the esscence of matter being solid, holds with it either a quality, or joint remark
                    regarding
                    relations, namely in the differentation of substance, as not to merely hold what we deem properties
                    of
                    matter -- solidity, motion--- but also the distribution of it, as the apparent complexity of the
                    world seems
                    to come from.
                    <br>&emsp;The mystery most personal to us is sensation; the defintiion of which would surely
                    eradicate any
                    archaic mention of mind. Just as the idea of solidity is but an aggregate of something smaller and
                    not so
                    solid, so does sensation lay; in that by the relation of things, so do we have such experience; but
                    the
                    actual experience itself, whereby we are aware of the sensation, and by that privy to its result
                    (pain),
                    that so is our awareness of an equal granularity as the stimuli reception. For instance, light is
                    not but a
                    certain ripple, and it wofts over to us after bouncing off something; and because we see so many of
                    those
                    wofts, there is a composition. In terms of perception, and its form, it seems right to say, in a non
                    dual
                    sense, that each point of stimuli is received by a particualr appartus: a point if you will. And the
                    hypothesis is that there are as many apparti as there are points of the composition. Also possible
                    is that
                    the resolutiion of our vision is perhaps not so granular, but full of larger portions which have
                    there own
                    correspondingly large apparati. "Somewhere in the middle, lies the batchings of discrete stimuli,
                    with
                    batches of discrete apparati, which form a less diffuse image: as if this section of apparati formed
                    this
                    portion of the input. Together, the composition may in fact be full of many large pieces, as we'd
                    deem;
                    while the actually mechanism is in fact more diffuse, but arranged into higher order. As if there
                    were the
                    provinces of an impression which we were aware of, but the actual making of such portions (and thus
                    pieces
                    of the whole) were made from the municipalities. "

                    So, the care one has in where they live, is not but a range of practical limits, prosperous wonder,
                    a hint
                    of hope, and a realistic chance of nicer scenery.
                    <br>&emsp;At it's core, all is the same, varying only in complexin. And indeed, the brighter side of
                    our
                    efforts is aimed at seeing further sides; or different ones.
                    <br>&emsp;But while we may be resting ourselves, or procurring some meaningfull end, so are we
                    obliged to
                    the lands around; in terms of where we'll walk, what we'll see, the literal crust of our existence.
                    <br>&emsp;As it were, most places fair best when they have views of the sky or mountains. Distance
                    being a
                    mere scaling factor to this. For being near a mountain does not offer a lingering breadth to it; nor
                    does
                    being far away hold much notice. The sky is not esteemed based on its height, but rather the scope
                    of your
                    view. So if there are trees in the way, or rises in land or residence, then you may see little, in
                    terms of
                    width and depth. And indeed mountains and the sky blend nicely when the right viewport and distance
                    is held.
                    But both can be appreciated on their own. A mere hill will always offer some sight of the sky. Nor
                    will
                    flatlands offer little near residences, and especially not amidst the more open stretches of land.
                    Mountains
                    tend to be tricky to see; for unless a road is wide or bare of trees, then only in the center lane
                    can you
                    see what lies yonder. There are paths though and rear allies which can afford a direct line of
                    sight. But
                    foremost, is a park mans friend here. As the more open land there is, particularly when there is a
                    height
                    above the tree/house line, then the relative peak of the mountains will stand out. And indeed, open
                    lands
                    may fair these sights with ease, differing only in the flat spot you view from: which is not always
                    as nice.
                    To note, that being higher up in general will give a better view of the sky. For the better parts of
                    the day
                    are the quick moments from sunset to dusk, where the melting yellow mixes with the darkening hues:
                    making a
                    rich and velvety blue. This can be seen better from higher up. Though, distance does benefit one's
                    view of
                    such things, as you can see a the broader scopes of the gradient. But with an untrained eye, or
                    squinting
                    stance, the bulk of the colors may blend together.
                    <br>&emsp;In that, you generally have two aspects to living. One regards walking, the other riding.
                    For the
                    first, you are benefited greatly by a grid system; as your medley of strolls will have more
                    variation in
                    terms of routes, rather than relying simply on changes of direction. Parks are God's proof here, as
                    resting
                    amidst a walk is amongst the best feelings, and of a nourishing sort. "Reading a book in these
                    instances is
                    likely my favority thing." But one need not rely on local livnig to enjoy themselves, or find
                    activity. With
                    the advent of scooters, one may evenly ride to nearby points of interest; be it for a view, a rest,
                    or a
                    mere bound around. Whereas our walks extend to the roads nearby, and on occasion to the edge of the
                    neighbourhood, so can riding take us through town, and far parts of the land at that. Combined with
                    transit,
                    you can go to a whole new world. From that, the everyday things you see and care for, have little
                    gems from
                    intersperced sights; along with occasional gems of far views following travels to esteemed spots.
                    This gives
                    an appreciated volume to our daily movement. "For it can be all to troublesome to either need some
                    marvel,
                    or fetter or not having one; or to unervingly go to one."

            So we are of the Green family. And for many years, I have been cushioned by our welcoming of our parents
            generoisity, and the corresponding positivty which we've incresinlgy shown in such a state; to which they
            have further accepted me.
            <br>&emsp;But the sentiment as of late is one of stark contrast to this. For the man, Ryan, who is of the
            family, is not truly himself. What he lacks, or better yet, what he achieve, is one thing. But that he is
            essentially cultivating the softer sides of his time, and with relative angst, furthering his deeper sides,
            is not so redeemable or satisfying for me and my parents anymore.
            <br>&emsp;The truth in the matter is complicated. As a comprehensive review will show you a) where we are
            best to go towards, or what we are to relieve, and b) what I personally seek, am at liberty to care for or
            be content with, and otherwise seek, and see as neccessary --for which I have till this point learned. This
            is generally forgotten when I recieve input from my parents; who, in all their kindness and loving heart,
            bear down of the fairness of their point, and construde in a way that lacks compassion or reference to those
            former elements. It is, plainly, as if they wish for me to be fully be, or at least be as I currently am in
            an upward trajectory. But they forgo who I have become thus far; nor, of the comforts which I am now part,
            how they've came to be. And depsite our assumptions and complacence being in part why we are without much
            handle on things, so is it not from an overreaching abuse of such comforts. Time just came this way; and
            fairly, I was sent to so; and with a mixture of fairness and naievety, focused on the things pleasant to me,
            and of a dear neccessity.
            <br>&emsp;I don't feel like the amends for broader pursuits, and foremost some stability, is ill-founded.
            But the balance of sentiment ought reflect current treatments, 'as if I needed such relief', and whats good
            long term, 'which ought hold, from the beginning, our trajectory; and upon establishment, review of our
            balance, and the profit ahead and or reach for sustainability'.
            <br>&emsp;At this point, a fair admission would provide some clarity. I moved up to Kamloops December of
            2022. At that point, I had stabilized in Vancouver, following our families split from Pitt Meadows; and all
            in all, I was happy. Truly, I had made some bad choices, but there effect was not at that point weighing me
            down. And depsite the awkward assertions of the summer, we had more or less settled into the flow of work
            and living. I can't say where things would have gone, or what I would seek or see; especially considering
            the current state were in, and whether or not that other future would compare. But I can say, depsite not
            fulfilling this, that I was on route to see the good and ease in work and living.
            <br>&emsp;But alas, I moved, and for the soul reason my dad was sick. I can account that the sentiment of
            this quickly died from despair, to a lingering misfortune. By the time the new year came about, our norm of
            being home settled in, and our day to day living occured. Our stay was in relation to our parents trip in
            the spring. And beyond that, we had some sense, or feeling of uncertainty, that we'd leave after the summer.
            By this time our dads health was not much in question, and our own life was fairly free. We wrote, made a
            book, made a new version of our website. We played God of War, watched the Excorcist, watched Kyle play
            Elden Ring. And foremost, we developed a sort of humble living; one of which was more than ever, pleased to
            be as was right for the present, and not but considerate, if not clear, on the nature of the future, and our
            all to easy oblige: to which we were fine to consent to and later amend, and by that, live with happiness
            and ease: for we sought no other direction than how things would come to be.
            <br>&emsp;Past a few incidents, the summer came, and our stay was in question. There was little apprhension
            on my parent's side, and the thought of me staying was quite welcome. I personally saw little delight in
            this, as Kamloops felt confined. And as the early months of summer went on, I felt a little stale. Despite
            going through the motions, I felt content to stay, and transition into the fall. I can't recall when this
            notion came up, but our parent's planned to go to Europe the following spring; and so our stay seemd to
            naturally follow. Equally unsure, but the unsigned agreement was that I would stay till July; in part
            because another trip to visit my grandparents was happening after the return from Europe. These plans
            admittedly may have solidifed later in the year; but so they became. All the while beforehand, we were
            simply accepting our stay into the cold months; and I'd say our sense was that we'd leave in the spring. And
            from there the itineraries developed.
            <br>&emsp;Through the fall we picked up our pace, refurbishing our book, getting to practical state of
            health, and doing some of our deepest writing till that point. "Beyond light as it were." But in this stage
            something happened. Our sense of the future and how things would be was tampered with. You see, our idea of
            work and living was that, in our comfortable estate, we were good and happy to make use of it, and enjoy it
            in a fair and laudible way. The future would come, and we were not averse or afraid of what it did. And our
            transition would naturally occur. But, as one would see across the years prior, that we had a habit of
            siding with whats good and pleasing, for the price of waiting for those future things. And indeed, the
            simplicity which we had experienced with them thus far, gave me a sort of reasonable excuse to do so. But
            there wasn't sure fire happiness with respect to our outer regards. For we still dreamt of fame and glory,
            of changing things. Admittedly, this feeling had begun to flatten out when we left Pitt Meadows, but still
            in this current day we held the remnants of literary and romantic expextation. And indeed, this was a mark
            of our naievety; but better said, a remark as to our choices, and the tone of our character and state as
            became of them; to which we were not so acquited or in place regarding the manners and means of friends and
            success. "Our relative success, near the roots of things in years prior, likely led to our complacency in
            how things were; but for this and that reason, we still held the remnants of dreams, which cloytered our
            wish for Bronte and Sums to be heralded to me." During Christmas we had a melt down; feeling the
            inexhaustible wait of being happy all the time, and not subsided by the imagined bond between me and Bronte,
            the Mason, or Shawn. These things not being there, led to a radical implosion when we weren't by our own
            means happy. That is the sentiment at least. And so we felt the need to be so perfect, that the slightest
            request to not do so felt unerving and drastic. So, at Christmas, when dinner and festivities were lauded
            without care, so were we averse, and unable to appreciate any of it. And as it were, we cried out that we'd
            made a mistake. By my counts, the feeling was that we had been living as though things would come for the
            better; and such sentiments were cushioning the less than outward nature of our lives. Realistically, there
            is a moral here that exclaims the unneccssary privation of our excellence. But as I knew, and in some sense
            as it practically were, that behavior of ours was merely to blind to the future whhich would give room to
            not be so perfect; and feel fine being only moderatley happy. The progressive point though, is that depsite
            being so happy, and via our excellent means, that such mode of living required the sort of variety and
            limberness which any mode would. And our choices had not procurred the support, comfort, relations or care,
            for what would yield me such. "And our mistake was taking ourselves too serioulsy, and overly relying on our
            means to make us happy. For in doing so, we turned ourselves away from what would, to the point, be there
            and heeding to your excellence; and not, as it was known, as a friction or contrast to it. For the choice
            otherwise, was to be compeltely self sustainable; the price of which was a state of excellence which could
            only come from day to day action: for neither the truth, nor complacence of others, would accept the end as
            so. And our cry was such, that we never thought otherwise. But, poorly let it happen."
            <br>&emsp;So as year two came up, we were fairly contemt. Though, our insight at the time was that more
            invovlement would produce more ease and regularity in me. And for some part it did. By the spring we were
            going to church, attending Yoga, showing up for several meet ups online, and life felt good. What I noticed
            though was that these things were not always desirable to attend; particularly because the nature of them
            was such, that our truest selve was not known. And rather than going to see friends, it felt like seeing
            acquaintances or colleugaes. Some new some things about me. But very little of what actually held me through
            the day I shared. As a result, we stopped going to these things. For the flow of our life was such, that
            being consistent was key. And it happened that these events felt like things we were waiting for and having
            to attend. And our actions were such that I just wanted to flow on by. I learned though that these sort of
            things were accessible to me; and this sense extended to broader means as well. And our future has seemed
            more pleasing and balanced because of this.
            <br>&emsp;Besides that, we were very productive early in the year, remaking our website, making a bunch of
            videos online, rewriting our book, and generally maintaining a constant stream of writig; one which has not
            ceased to this day. Our leisure remained pure, our use of scootering brought much wonder and depth to our
            days, and the general sentiment around was that we were more than fine, free to be, and on route for a
            fairer time ahead.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed the summer came. But whereas the prior one felt like a drain, this one held moments which
            were at worst, moderate. Indeed, our bare appreciation allowed this, but so did scootering get me out of the
            house; and even out the drawn out days. As my parents came back from trips though, the idea of me leaving
            was put on hold. They suggested that they would like to travel in the fall, and that I might stay then. I
            had expressed interest in leaving no later than October 1st. After some time, it was settled that I'd leave
            December 1st.
            <br>&emsp;What occured though, is that my parents decided to sell their home in the middle of summer. They
            had friends who expressed interest in buying the place, and so they made formal agreement. They would sell
            their home then, and my parents would find a house in Pitt Meadows. The former though never came to par. And
            still to the day, we have the home we purchased, and the one not yet sold. As it became known, October 26th
            was the acquisition date. And through the weeks leading up, we loaded up smaller things to be sent down to
            friends houses. I recall feeling sturdy, yet apprhensive about the whole thing. For it was expressed that,
            by virtue of senitment, and financial strain, I would have to get a job. I did not care for this, but our
            choice seemed out of the mattter. Up till this point, we were under the impression that we would recieve
            means to move once we left our parents. A clear figure of 5000$ was the unsigned agreeement. When I had
            moved up to Kamloops, I had spent to much money on rent, and accumulated some debt. My parents paid this off
            for me, kindly; but also gave my sister twice the sum of what they gave me. And the understanding was that I
            would get the other half when I moved out. This could not occur due to the financial strain of owning two
            homes.
            <br>&emsp;Since we've moved, I have felt a receding amount of contempt regarding our life and scennario.
            When we did move, there were frequent comments about me getting a job, and indeed I felt compressed between
            our resitance to doing so, at least in the options available. I leaned in though and attempted to go to
            Superstore. There was a miscomunnication, and I did not get a job. Till this point, we've spoken to Dev,
            showed our interest, clarified our ability to work anytime, and hopefully there is some promsie for a new
            year hire. Similarly, I spoke with Poco and Maple Ridge wal-mart. Each are near equals to Superstore in
            preference, and, like Superstore, hold oppertunity in the new year. Everything else has been a bust. Despite
            our initial reservations, we were willing and directed to cleaning, caring, land duties, even conierge.
            Nothing came through, and all the likely because we sent resumes online. While personal shoppping affords a
            direct line of contact.
            <br>&emsp;As of now, I feel a bit more part of the family. And despite not seeking a richer end, I still
            feel a fairer approach to our reasonable destination. Having work would make things at home stable, and thus
            we'd be happier. But the nature of being at home is that most obligations feel intrusive; especially when it
            is for the sake of being at home. Compared to our own dependance, being at home feels like an easy comfort.
            Which, indeed, holds the point of our future remarks: and our parents emphasis on work. At any rate, I am
            sure we will find some harmony in being here, and more stabily proceed to our final end. It may be
            otherwise, by virtue of a lack of harmony, or we may recieve that small privalage of being sent there with
            haste.
            <br>&emsp;Of such end, I see a place I'll be long term. A place whos simple oppertunities can act as
            promises of relief and improvment. A place who's' very nature directs us to establish our self, and our way.
            Vancouver seems this land, for it is dense, rough in terrain, yet bold in it's views. And, independance is
            all I really need; for I feel little long term means or care to direct myself when I'm not.

                So we have spoken with mom and dad. It went well, then became abrasive, but then settled back to fair
                closure.
                <br>&emsp;Simply, we are free to figure things: but that we must figure things out is a certainty.
                <br>&emsp;As I was feeling a week ago, there is this sentiment in the family, that in good times, the
                future
                is not so near, and our promsies of how we'll proceed need not oblige some proposed threat. As such, we
                felt
                that our treatment was corresponding to a less than severe outlook. Now, it seems that this treatment is
                not
                going to be one of fortune, but mere acceptance. We can try for Superstore or Walmart as we can. But
                this is
                3 weeks away, so relax, run, rest, enjoy. Your not asked to do anything. At least it's out there in the

                I would like to say something though, at least so that you may understand. I am at home, and indeed, for
                some time, I've done so rent free, with accomodations.
                <br>&emsp;First, this is the extent of it. I don't smoke, drink, drive, go out, buy things in general.
                It is
                a privalage to be at home, and I am not on the side that says that this is the right thing to do. But it
                is
                how things happened. And my interests and ways climatize to it well. If I could say this without venom,
                you
                could live at home as I do. But by your own interests and ways, it happens not. Ultiamtely, it is better
                and
                required to be indepenant. And by your scrutiny, and by my own reflection, I agree, and am feeling the
                effects of not doing so. "It's as if I said, 'I'll get in shape some day', but that day either doesn't
                come,
                or, if it does, you have to work even harder, because you've lost so much in the mean time." I am indeed
                feeling the ware of being at home, sleeping next to mom and dad, having no friends, no romance. It is
                easy
                to feel good and comfortable when you don't have anything to do. But it is not easy to be happy. "My
                privalage is really an allowance to be myself. But doing so does not extend very far." Indeed, my care
                for
                health and propiety is helmed for that. And I get quite defensive, for I do have little besides myself.
                And
                when the means to that get nudged, or spun over, I get defensive and frusterated.

                Ultimately Jess, I see that your struggling, and in all fairness, I am not. This is because of privalge
                sure, but also from the chocies I've made.
                <br>&emsp;As it's happened, Dad asked me to move up at the end of 2022. I left my job, and all things
                relating to romance and friends. In retrospect, I was to pleased to leave and return to ease and
                comfort.
                That's just how it goes.
                <br>&emsp;Mom and Dad went for their trip in April, and my sense leading into that was that I'd leave at
                the
                end of the summer. Summer came, and they asked what I wanted to do; we were in perfect harmony, and the
                thought I've being there through the holidays didn't overt me; so I decided to stay, and likely leave in
                the
                spring.
                <br>&emsp;Mom and Dad then said their going to Italy and Palm Springs --for two months basically in May
                and
                June--- and for a very long time, it was known that I was to stay till July. "It's hard to describe
                agreeements within a family, but in terms of understanding at least, it was such that Dad asked me to
                stay
                till then, and I surely obliged."
                <br>&emsp;When that day came, we had a discussion. I expressed that I wanted to live; specifically, I
                said
                that I did not want to spend another winter. Mom and Dad said that they intended to (maybe) go to Hawwii
                in
                the fall, and whehtehr or not I coud stay for the sake of the cats. Nothing was signed on the dotted
                line.
                My wish was not to move later than October 1st. Septemebr seemed nice. A little while went on, and I
                said I
                would stay. Decemebr 1st was explicitly stated. I did not want to get stuck here for the winter, and
                likely
                remain till the spring. Shortly after, Mom and Dad got into cahoots with Sharron and Rob. They had
                scoured
                for houses, but for some time, the sentiment was that 'our house is not being sold till next year',
                we'll
                look then. When we spoke prior about me leaving, there was no move on the table. And, to be clear, in
                the
                year prior, I had that credit card debt. Mom and Dad gave me 5000$. My understanding is that they gave
                you
                10. Dad said he would give me the other 5 when I moved out. And, generally, there was a comfrotable
                feeling
                (often expressed, more or less) that I would have meand and support to move -whenever that'd be.
                <br>&emsp;Jim and Sharron said they'd buyt the house near the end of July. Their house did not sell
                though.
                As this fact became final, Mom and Dad had already bought their house. We packed and moved, and I did so
                happily; at least, without a scuff and frown. It simply had to be done.
                <br>&emsp;Now that were back though, I've just been on the end of a pitiable and contempuous snetiment.
                As
                if I've been wasting away, 'and it's about time your grew up'. I've felt this odd, because prior to the
                move, this snetiment was nowhere to be found. "It's as if people were happier, and understood the
                developments of the past." Yet, having moved, it's as if none of it happened, and I am now merely
                someone
                who has not been working and needs to get a life.
                <br>&emsp;Now, I understand how the privalge I have upsets you, especially when you don't share the load
                of
                it. But my feeling is that, if you were not struggling, then your judgements upon would either be a)
                absent,
                b) not so scruitable, and c) more accurate. "I feel often (and I do this to), that when I'm upset and
                looking at others to be upset with, I look for things that confirm my feelings, rather than warranting
                them
                to begin."

                As it often occurs, I need a moment to sift my thoughts and reflect.
                <br>&emsp;Our family is a little unstable, as I. Harmony is always on offer, but the truth in this is
                hard
                to oblige, when the present is so rot with the ultimate effects 'of merely having harmony'.
                <br>&emsp;Our stability is such, that we can see, be it alone or with others, the future in a solid and
                forward way. Currently, however, we see a discociation from our current spot, regardless of harmony.
                Indeed,
                the harmony could itself solidify, and secure our drifting pace, 'but still a drift no less'.
                <br>&emsp;Now, in moments of duress, it is hard not to respond to heavily to the current moment. In
                calmer
                moments however, but of a negative sort, you can see clearly what is right to do for the years ahead.
                <br>&emsp;By that, I see that we are not so fit in regards to health, nor is our moral, relational or
                creative prowess where it could be; nor is our personal interest as collected as I know it could be.
                "I'd
                describe our life as a constant amendment for the latter, while the former aspects whilter away; leaving
                me
                with nothing by hopes and apprehension, and thereby a drain our interest."
                <br>&emsp;Our composure within these slower moments lets me see how things ought be, with respect to
                orientation for the sake of stability. For one, indepandence feels neccessary, for progess is otherwise
                exposed to the differing forces of others; nor is it able to be consistent, and by that, further. "It
                often
                gets dry and swollen, or otherwise cracked in its base, and wilts and wains."
                <br>&emsp;I will not sit here and say that what is near and present, is not either relevant, likely to
                be
                irking our emotions and intent. But, in all fairness, the unease I feel is revealing prior notions; or
                at
                least current thoughts tailored to our reason and sense. Indeed, I am all to contained, as not to let
                our
                negativivity spurr feelings in that 'progressive sense'; as if I considered moving farther forward, away
                from our current pich, but due to the dissaray which such pitch has brought, and accordingly omtivated,
                that
                there are less than proper objects to be measured through our sense, and future regard.

                So I don't forget, the Cybersecurity is a good option for someone like me. Relativley cheap, fast, with
                praacticum, work from home, solid.
                <br>&emsp;I am looking for information about the nature of study, it being online, and examinations. Who
                I
                may colloborate with. The price is important too, and the course layout is also unclear; as you don't
                recieve credits, nor is the schedule for them outlined. I would like to have more information regarding
                the
                certificate and prospect. Skills are one thing, but they merely allow you to perform; or indicate your
                potential via a portfolio, or the practicum. But the certificate then is the real stamp, and I am
                curious if
                everything else is novelling benefiting, while the certificate is a meager credit.

                Quick note. I had a poor controller. I bought 2 more, each had its quirks. My plan, was to buy one, keep
                it,
                and return the old one as if it were new. Having bought two, I still (in esscence) returned one, then
                exchanged our intial with the second. As of now, we are getting a refund for the 2nd controller. We have
                also returned the first. So right now, we've got refunds for both, and a free controller. Meaning we
                have
                two. They are generally fine, though I ought clarify which one I'd take back --as each have their
                quirks.
                Once things have settled, I may buy another for exchange, but still then have two.

                So we have been asked to stay, once again. Despite this, we have also been offered the means to leave,
                and
                in a fair state.
                <br>&emsp;I am not sure what to do. What is right holds me towards Vancouver; as it is where I'd like to
                be,
                grow and stay. I compare this to atheletics, in that, for all positions, ought you remain limber and
                spry.
                But even if you mean to play baseball, and well, so ought to be in line for that, per the aspects
                (particular) required. In the same sense, that you may merely be un-negative, and by that, ample in your
                general atheltics, but thereby not fully foster, that so may you, in your specifics, be equally ample,
                but
                not full grown.
                <br>&emsp;In that sense, we have never been unathletic per say. But our time doing so has never been
                easy,
                as our amends to cushion and or iron out downward trends, has never been understood or accepted, as such
                intent was aimed at something non-specific. Across the whole of our lives, ought we be specific, sure.
                But
                our cultivation does not lack the product of such pursuit, merely the orientation: as if we indeed had a
                heading at all. For so long we've merely been, and well, but to no end but that which might call me. It
                is
                time, or at least reason ultiamtely suggests, that heeding some call, be it with far or mere limber
                steps,
                is upon us.
                <br>&emsp;In this way, we have a fair amount of clarity. As the sentiment within me is one that wavers
                over
                the quality of our 'general athletics', but not our direct skill. In other words, we are more concerend,
                theres a feeling at least, that of our mozying ways, ought we do this or that to make such strides
                preferable. Indeed, there are remarks about this; and if our strides were not at all ruffled, then
                surely
                I'd be fine to remain generally well. But I see from time to time the reality of being so general, and
                the
                predicament we find ourself which affords us to do so, in fact not being so stable. By that, in the
                finer
                moments of this place, we consider the actual truth of the matter, and where we can be that is not
                merely
                general, but actual, stated, right, of ends.
                <br>&emsp;Indeed, our current moment has me accepting a sort of finality, in that, of our time ahead, so
                are
                there things which we see our general attitude being unkept for. I do not doubt that we will reach a
                point
                that is appropraite for those; but this carries with it the sentiment 'that we will then begin'. Which,
                again, is not something I am overt to. But in the current moment, when our ease of mozying is troubled,
                and
                were asked to otherwise bolster our generality, or a path which is specific, it is hard not to seek the
                latter.

                So I know what things mean in the long term; regarding what's right, and our likely course. The mid term
                is
                always tricky; and indeed, our life is so that we'd prefer some stabiilty to that sense. But for now, we
                know that we are not living at home scott free. We may leave, and in no hurry. Or we may get a job. For
                those, there are the primary one's for personal shopping; though, from our direct line with them, these
                jobs
                are more than faorable, but approachable. Secondary jobs are those at similar stores, but other
                positions.
                And we may find something that is akin to cleaning or labour, but part time (and thus not so bad). These
                are
                harder to approach though. We are able to communicate with Superstore and east/west walmart. And less
                they
                say no, and for some time, then we'll rest on those.
                <br>&emsp;There seems no pressure to do so otherwise. Indeed, the sense that we are not benefitting by
                not
                working (while at home) is fundmentally there. But the contempt for me not working has ceased;
                particulary
                with Jess moving home. The fact that she works validates her being here; but doing so in the same
                condition
                as I, makes me less privalaged, and subject for scorn. So whether we move or stay, is up for me to
                decided,
                and let pan out.
                <br>&emsp;For now then, regardless of what we know and expect, we are free to see and heed the days
                ahead.
                Foremost, we are not well. Our sleep is off, as we are not eating enough, nor (in unison) exercising.
                This
                isn't from a lack of sound principles, but use of them. I cannot recall why, for I feel that we've had
                periods of up; but for whatever reason we've come down. My blodd pressure feels parched, my chest feels
                no
                more than moderatley strong; and our sitting is a bit uneven.
                <br>&emsp;Our sleep is the biggest issue, be it a symptom or cause. Foremost, were waking up then going
                back
                to bed; which is an almighty deficit. Something I'd suggest is not putting to much value on the time,
                and
                any commone sense of it, but rather sleep appropraitely based on when you go to bed. The time you wake
                should be regular, but let it alter based on your current state, and merely alter the average. Right now
                we've been going to bed around 2, waking at 8, then drifting past 9. Waking at 850 and getting up then
                would
                be better. And going to bed at 1 would make 815 approachable.
                <br>&emsp;Exercise wise we are doing well, and the grounds are there. But our state is such, that basic
                things are adding ware where they should not. In this way, we ought balance the return to an ample
                state,
                while not pressing to hard. I'd describe the routine then as one of activity and firming; whereby the
                aerobic motions have some solidity to them. Namely, balancing free range and running, with squats and
                light
                pushups, can afford us some progress, withou to much rigidity. There will be some, but pushing ourselvs
                to
                do pullups and grough pushups will only drill us in.
                <br>&emsp;For what we lack in ability, and the ware from the balanced approach, hatha and recovery will
                produce. Namely, downward dog, upward dog, leg raise, forward fold, and warrior will suffice. These may
                need
                balancing in terms of your state; but the primary ones of downward dog can at least be common, and
                satiating
                for whats essential. Our recovery is in the greatest state, with folds for our legs and arms winding us
                out,
                and permitting our sinking rest. Finding similar variety in our hatha would go along way. But going from
                standing, to squats, to wide legged, through lunge and warrior, can all hoist up the neccessary downward
                dog, leg raise and upward dog. In the same way that running and skips can hoist squats, pushups and pull
                ups.
                <br>&emsp;Food wise we are in a notably poor state. We've stopped having smoothies, and for whatever
                reason,
                the result has been poor. I've recognized the lack of flax, for which I am having seeds for breakfast
                and
                lunch, and the limit of calcium withotu the soy, for which I've been having my supplement. Said
                supplement
                has bid us a tricky custom, for we don't entirely believe in it; nor is it recommended to have without a
                big
                meal. If I accept it's novelty, and not be to barren of the calcium which the soy supposedly holds, then
                we
                can grant its stay and merrit, and have it with dinner. One of the main issues though, is that with our
                sleep and lighter exercise, we don't eat our roughage for breakfast. I am sure this is contributing to
                our
                'half full feeling'. That, and our oranges are not present, and thus our first bit of energy is absent,
                or
                subsistuted poorly. We have given up smoothies, and quinoa for the most part. But oranges are so cheap,
                that
                as a crux of our diet, it is worthwhile to spend on them freely. For else, we have sunflower seeds,
                cranberries, bananas, rice, barley and lentils; along with breads, popcorn, potatoes and hash. All is
                well,
                but for the fundementals.

                So I'm watching a video about the climate. And a pretty good one at that. Theres this common style of,
                'did
                you know', and 'so and so says this, aint that interesting!'. This case had such a style, but with a bit
                more substance; which I saw at least.
                <br>&emsp;But I noticed, as they were remarking upon something, that all that I was seeing was someone
                spreading facts. They may be ill-founded or not, but the expression was merely me stairing at a wall,
                and
                saying things of little worth. Similar to one speaking about the fate of the universe. Our life is here,
                happening, and so much is going on which is but glistened by these marginal effects. The meaning of the
                facts is that such a brimming is increasing, and that subtle changes have significant results.
                <br>&emsp;My insight though, is that people speaking about things does not bring to life what you'd
                otherwise recieve from reading a prompter of headlines or prices. These are more like advertisments,
                rather
                than enditments on the position of traffic, or converstations being had in shops nearby. Its broader
                things
                being said. But the point of prediction is from the flowing present; and such flow is really slow. And
                by
                that, our life is best to respond in principle. Because there are injuries and misfortune. But gradual,
                as
                there has been prior to these remarks. Theres but more swelling.

                So I phoned West Walmart on Monday: Jessica was sick. I phoned yesterday, once at 850, another
                at 11, and both times I could not get through. "I found that getting transferred to customer
                service is more likely to put you through --as that is where I failed to reach, not neccessarily
                the online shopping." I phoned today then, and Jessica was not there.
                <br>&emsp;So I phoned oll Dev, he picked up, I said it was Ryan Green, and he seemed relatively
                delighted to hear from me. I wished him happy new years, and he to I; and I just sort of got to
                the point, 'asking about any oppertunity to work there'. Admittedly, he kind of slackly dodged
                the question. But I did get some information, the heart of which may meant little, but was not
                expressed to me with much scorn or contempt. Simply, times are slower seeing as it is January,
                and so, by his words, 'he does not have the budget to hire'. Literally though, he said quite
                clearly, that he may in a few weeks. I confirmed that I wuold phone him then, and he said sure,
                we may be able to get it going. This is similar to what he said before. And I don't believe he
                was just waiving me off; as his response to me calling seemed pretty genuine. So I don't doubt
                his intent; and my intuition tells me, that he understands that I am keen to get the job, and
                that if he could offer it to me, he would. But he's not really going out on the line. Which is
                probally fair and to be expected. Balancing our expectation though is a meager matter, as he may
                likely say the same thing when we call him then. Or he may actually say sure. It seems our
                eligibility is banked on whether he can, or he wants to. Otherwise, I feel pretty confident that
                the matter is one of mutual understanding. That he remarks upon me as a stranger he knows, who
                has shown eager interest, of which, like a good anyone is fine and pleased to offer someone, so
                would he oblige. But his dutie comes first. And so it will only be our fortune, when his
                generositiy and responsibility align.

                So walmart west manager left, so no hiring. Similar to Dev, I feel like i'm in their minds. And
                hopefully upon a new manager, and the corresponding need to hire, I'll earn the chance to be
                hired. I should get a call regardless, when Jessica knows. She may forget, but like the other
                two, I'm almost equally set to call a few weeks from now. If none of the three will hire me, or
                are not hiring then, less we hear something concrete which warrants me staying, I'll look for a
                place March 1st, likely find this in the first half of Februrary; and assuming we go look at the
                place, we can stop at Metro Town walmart and Superstore to inquire about a job. Phoning is
                always fine, and surely this will permitt us for other jobs in the case of nothing from both
                superstores or walmarts. But we can directly correspond while were there, phone, and at least,
                put our ear in. Realistically, if we associate ourselves as we have done now with the current
                superstore or walmart, but at Metro town or Grandview, then we can equally set ourselves for
                surer employment. And our few month layover will bare us till then.

                So the news is fine. In theory, it offers sensibility to common folk. Who, to be clear, are not
                common because they watch the news; rather, by the fact that they are common, in that they are
                mere working people, that the news caters to them.
                <br>&emsp;For me though, I find it does not suffice for serious study. The fact that it is
                media, makes it a little eradict and elated, and thus not effective for detailed views. That,
                and the actual view it offers, is quite small compared to actual reading; in regards to earthly,
                political and civil matters.
                <br>&emsp;The issue you see, is that, in the civil realm, there are all matters of grooves and
                happenings. And one account of something here does not relate to much over there. Broadly
                speaking it does, but so is the value of such remarks made against the quality of our broad
                view; which is not but minorly served by one mere account. This is prevalanent in world affairs,
                as one conflict in Jerusalaem is no mark of Africa, South America, Europe or Asia. Nor does it
                encapuslate the whole middle east. And I would not say, on local levels, that the remarks of the
                polis in Jerusalem is fully understood; for who even understands their own polis. It really gets
                boiled down to the leader and his accredited actions. But this is not the entirety of a
                government, in federal, state or municipal levels. Civil matters are even more diffuse; as the
                frontline of conflict takes place in only certain parts of the country; and from there,
                interarctions between folk are guided by such. But outside that realm, even under the natioanl
                influence of the conflict, so do people's ineractions occur outside the heat of such conflict.
                More important, is that even in terms of conflict, be it in arms reach of the fire, or under the
                national influence, so is there so much which goes on between people, that an incidence of every
                sort would not remark much. As, in each kind of action, such as driving, there are an
                overwhelming amount of occurences which are passing and normal. This is the case for all things
                in life. And if we consider the relative view of things, whereby things occur by their relations
                to others, rather than by some generic force, then the accidents in Jordan are not all linked to
                those in Cyprus. Observing one or many incidents can teach you about the kind of occurence at
                hand; but so are the principles derived applied uniquley to different areas. For it is one thing
                to say that poor road laws produce accidents in general; but so are the poor laws of Jordan
                exhibited to its onw people, and those of Cyprus by their local laws. As it is no small matter
                that the complexion of principles vary. As are the elements subject to them also varied, and by
                that, seperate and unique from other locales. "In many ways, the proper regard of the world is
                best described under the lens of force and object: one being state and law, the other history
                and man. Where each comes about, subject only to their moving pace: but under the influence of
                that which has settled around: as objects sure, but on permanet grounds. The matter of channels
                and the water which flows through it."

                particualr holds risk of backlask; and the curtain is no different.
                <br>&emsp;We are also apt to spray the shower, in a collective attempt to clean it. Long term,
                this will do us good, and we ought oblige for the present.
                <br>&emsp;Closing the door after we use the washroom is causing trouble. I need to not let it

                cannot be closed. Espcially in spite of there being a smell.
