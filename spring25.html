            At some point I will confer about our duties, and the meager means to meet them. I may consider the
            rules
            and custom which erect them, or pose them as a demand, or simply worthwhile, but more or less, I am in
            tune
            with such things, and need more remarks about our amends, and how we'll effectively demonstrate those.
            <br>&emsp;But, seeing as that moment is not here, and we are thus below the weight of lacking such, I
            will
            remark on those sights which my 'flatter state' is holding onto. "For, like passion, my delights, upon
            my
            means to be with them, slip into the realm of definition: where I try and hold principled attention,
            since
            our actual prescence to them is seperate: I try and hold myself there, for they are so dear, 'and I hate
            to
            seem them go', and with all might, bear our credulous regard, 'for in moments where the abyss is
            calling, I
            fight to prevent them becoming such memory'."
            <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this is our physical study. The issue of light has pressed me for some time,
            as
            remarking on our senses and impression, and by that, our view of the composite world, falls short of
            what it
            could be, in confidence and like, when our means to illustrate light, heat, their motions, and otherwise
            form, is either absent, 'or but a basic term, rather than vibrant concept'. "One ought know the fish and
            places of a reef, rather than it merely being one: for you can only then say so little."
            <br>&emsp;Adjacent to this is emperical methodology, namely, in spectroscpoy, carbon dating and other
            modes
            in which particles are observed. This is valued on our natural basis, 'as we can better claim the soul
            of
            the world, if, by such measurments, we can thus, in it's constitution, claim'. But similar to
            composition,
            in that you ought know more than a basic term, so ought you know more than the prescence of something,
            'that
            your knowledge amounts to knowing that something is there'. This awareness is but the crust of learning,
            as
            you ought know how such things are known to be there. For it is one thing to say the earth is however
            old,
            and another as to why, and thus how: by that, we may actually understand what the earth being so old
            means,
            as the mark that tells us so --as seen through instruments-- tells us also about the object at hand.
            <br>&emsp;Lastly, on the finer things, is the mark of a cloud, or mountain. This is so, that we look at
            Golden Ears, and see it in whole; but we also see that one of its peaks is called Blandshand, the other
            the
            Needle. But I do not know what they are, 'as if, Golden Ears the thing or place, had some feature, like
            snow
            even'; yet I could not say what such feature was, 'like a scratch or tatoo on someone's arm'. How ought
            I
            even state the heart of the mountain. Clouds are no different, in their flat expanse or roaring tuffs.
            There's even varied kinds of puff, be it the rising flat heads, or bundled rolls. These need better
            names,
            'for I wish to say more than it is nice and cloudy out'. As all days are different, and the suns rays
            even
            cast differently on the land around. I'd like to even see that, in the varied hues, but particularly, of
            what is shined on.
            <br>&emsp;I'll talk a bit of leisure too, as I find, in our applied work, or that of duty, that we
            always
            come back to games and watching. And, albeit fine and plenty, there are moments where the old stuff
            feesl a
            bit to so; or, in a slower state, we have less interest, 'and need something new, or at least something
            to
            bide our time'. Game wise, Fallout and Red Dead come to mind. We've just finished God of War and are
            working
            through Ragnorak, and there is Avowed and Indiana Jones, but, freely, and with more breadth, there is
            Fallout, and its starting adventure, full of scavenging and fun, and Red Dead, that, despite requiring
            mods,
            is full of wilderness exploration, hunting, bounties, quests, and colorfull scenery. Civ remains fun,
            and in
            understanding the parts of the ages, your civ and strategy, there remains much fun. Trying new things
            comes
            when you are in the groove of the game, 'as you see the mould, but through cirucmstance orient that'.
            The
            natural wonder battle seems a perfect fit for Spain, and I am full of delight at our coming Maurya game;
            and
            even a combat one, with Rome, or Persia.
            <br>&emsp;Show wise, I am right in the heart of fall allies. We are going through the latter part of our
            Inca game, and there is much to overhear while doing so. And I just can't help but feel nice, in terms
            of
            gaming to, that our pace of life is both right and forward, 'and thus, of what we see afar, so are we
            free
            and happy to meet, and thus anticipate: which gives much rest now'.

            To continue this line of thought, I see, that we are in fear of other's judgement; and when we see them
            reading or listening to certain people, we think, 'oh, well their going to be what said judgements are
            based
            on'.
            <br>&emsp;Another thing, is that in our own way, suscipion, or supposition rather, is a leading line of
            inquiry; and one, which repeatedly details the world. Only, if we are only with such sucipsion, and not
            actual possessed by what we figured, then we may feel defensve of what other's have presumably found.
            "As
            our sights are elsewhere, yet, we have no confidence or indifference from getting there."
            <br>&emsp;By that, I see, that akin to our physical sights, and geopgrhical too, that the history of our
            world is even more lost. For we have much sight, but little matter to fill it in. Namely, in the
            division of
            our communites and people, and how this relates to the lineage of social organization; and the otherwise
            sensible regards of varied domains. I see this in all walks of life, that the past is too blurrily
            known;
            which is to say, that in principle, we can see how it's come, and how the present is merely a current
            state
            of that. Then, the way it actualy is, which the past can give much insight to, as some far off case, or
            the
            present.

            The annals of Civ are always changing on me. For so long, the exploration seemed obvious, and Modern an
            exected mystery; all while we dealt with antiquity. But now, I see that, in distant land goals and
            infastructural ambition, that there is more you can do in each prior age to set up benefits for the
            next.
            And before I state those, I will mention, that barring the civ, it is not a guarentee that you'll have
            great
            science or culture in each coming age, and so giving yourself the means to is preferable. By that, less
            you
            have the means to do so, set your eye on one side of the sea. Splitting this and going far on both sides
            is
            a great ambition, and your science and production may not be up to the task. That, and considering the
            race,
            splitting may see you loose both.
            <br>&emsp;Colesseum is great for happiness, as it adds 2 per quarter. And 3 culture, and a later 2
            production isn't without relevance.
            <br>&emsp;Mundo Perdido is great if your in tropical, as it adds 1 science and happiness per said tile
            ---which could be all.
            <br>&emsp;If your playing as Joze Diaz, you want Oracle, as the culture per narrative event adds ontop
            of
            his own --- plus he has several more.
            <br>&emsp;Pyramid of the Sun is generally great, as it combines with Colloseum to add 3 culture per
            quarter.
            This is a great boon to early exploration.
            <br>&emsp;The Sanchi Stupa gives 1 culture per 5 excess happiness, locally. Depending on your civ, and
            assuming you have +5 villa and Arena, you might have upwards of 50 happiness in your captial, meaning 10
            culture. This scales also as you get even more happiness. At several hundred, your looking at near 50
            culture, which is a solid and natural occuring boon.
            <br>&emsp;Borobodur is a key wonder for this, as it adds happiness and food per quater. Combining this
            with
            Colesseum, and you have 4 happiness per quarter; which could total near 40 alone.
            <br>&emsp;The Brihadeeswarar Temple gives all buildings happiness adj. from navigable rivers.
            <br>&emsp;El Escorial adds relic slots, adds settlement limit ---along with another limit with the
            mastery--- and gives +4 happiness to every settlement in 7 tiles. This isn't tremedous, but it's still
            10-20, and things do add up.
            <br>&emsp;Despite contrasting the price of happiness, specialists are important, and with Notre Dame,
            which
            gives a celebration buff to specialists (+3 culture during), so does this pair with your happiness aim
            and
            the consquent celebrations.
            <br>&emsp;Shwedagon adds +2 science to all rural tiles that have at least 1 happiness, which may
            coincide
            with your happiness focus.
            <br>&emsp;White tower gives base 4 happiness, and +4 per tradition, which may be up to 5.
            <br>&emsp;Chengde Mountain Resort may be the best wonder in the game, giving a flat 5
            culture per civilization you have a trade route with. Of the 7 available besides you, that's a hard 35

            Jose is fine, but his narrative bonus only works with pure narrative events, 'not goody huts'. This
            makes
            the value of it pan out much sooner. His celebration buff is solid, but requires a strategy that
            strictly
            benefits that. He gets no other buff for happiness, and considering his boost towards celebration
            accruement, it is not so hard to do, and thus, not so limiting.
            <br>&emsp;If we were Ashoka, we'd get more food from happiness, and more happiness from building
            adjacency.
            I think this would improve our yields drastically.
            <br>&emsp;Maurya are great for their pantheon, and it seems relatively easy to get 50 happiness, and
            more
            like 100 once you get villas up. Thats 20 science and gold.
            <br>&emsp;Despite the strategy being science and gold from happiness, we still ought treat our empire
            well.
            We ought respect settlement caps, our science, be it for killing bards or defending oruselves. We have
            the
            means to the Sanchi Stupa, and you ought regard this in your adjacency. You do not get boost to
            districts
            from Mundi Purdo, so consider the time investment to get a few science and happiness. Colosseum is an
            eventual gem, and we'll likely go up that tree.
            <br>&emsp;Colleseum requires district, Sanchi Stupa requires plains, Borobudur requires coast,
            Brihadeeswarar requires rivers ---and only gives happy adj. to nav rivers. El Escorial requires rough,
            White
            tower next to city hall.
            <br>&emsp;Ashokas ability gives quarters 2 happiness per adj. improvement, and so you ought consider
            where
            rough tiles are going; as farms will be replaced. Though, resources act in this way as they are
            essentially
            improvements.
            <br>&emsp;He also gets 1 food for every 5 excess happiness, which is doubled with a memento. I had near
            30
            happiness in our captial, which is 12 food. That's alot.

            So I'm thinking of my leisure, and we are in between a few things. THis is alright though, as we have
            been
            meaning to go through yoga clips, to then edit.
            <br>&emsp;There is this corresponding effect of watching things which you please you while your idle;
            but
            then your dried up even further. I don't wish to amend then to such things, as if our indolence will
            stay. I
            am not against comfort; but besides our work reminding me of where we could improve, so do we have
            common
            things to do, like shower, laundry and dishes. If these are done, then flounder away; and let your time
            and
            relatively pure interest procure stronger foundations for your work.
            <br>&emsp;What were missing is a show, as we have Allies, One More Turn and Owl, but nothing to watch in
            between. This was New Girl for a time, and was Little Fires and Morning Show for a hot a moment. But
            we've
            nothing right now; worth accepting at least. We could do Angry Joe, in old reviews or tv shows, but our
            activity doesn't make this so keen. For the moment, I'd like get our chores done; and luckily I have;
            and
            then progress our yoga, 'as the asbcence of our doing it is becoming noticuble'. All the while, we can
            play
            Civ; in which, I've noticed the early and later exploration split, as you have more settlement room and
            thus
            places you ought eye ought to settle. God Of War is becoming a little slow, but shortly we'll be back
            into
            it, and then into something like Jedi Survivor, or Avowed. Red Dead is coming, and Ark and Diablo are
            there
            when we please. There may be movies to watch, 'as to supplement our emotional curiosity'. And with
            delight,
            like the clouds coming through the spring, I see equal cares, in chartering things, 'seeing them
            fuller'.
            Lord of the Rings speaks to me hear, as are the Osprey mountains in need of sense: as the clouds.

            SO Earth is it's own wing of things, and clearer to remark.
            <br>&emsp;The Great Migration needs the ending taken off, and a bit of the mid shortened.
            <br>&emsp;The Western Wall needs shortening in the middle; though, of the main ones in Asia --- Death,
            secunta, we will succeed-- so could we combine these all into a shorter amount of tracks.
            <br>&emsp;The Water one's are similar.
            <br>&emsp;Lazarius can remove the beginning, or at least shorten it: I want the bulk of the track to be
            the
            rise.
            <br>&emsp;I've done this before, but, with the quality version via the full Dark Knight 2 track, I'd
            like
            the 'Not a Hero' part by itself.
            <br>&emsp;There are several for Planet Earth 3, namely the Ostrich one, as it begins nicely, ends
            greatly,
            but finishes awkwardly; Mother Octopus needs trimming at the end, while Sea Lions could remove the
            beginning
            <br>&emsp;For Mammals, the chimps has calm beginnings and ending, paired nicely with the two birds ones
            (later in the track). The Micaque heist can be shortened into a nice action piece. I'd like to combine
            the
            end of the Arctic with something.
            <br>&emsp;I also wouldn't mind a rework of Sea of Blue, extending the end, making the rise faster.
            <br>&emsp;And figuring out how to record vegas while were listening to Youtube is crucial, as we can do
            so
            many slow downs, plus Dianne.

            So this girl Vienna comes up to me and asks me whether I like any movies. I replied, and we spoke about
            it
            for a moment. I did not like her, all the while I suspected she did. The next time I saw her, my
            interest
            had come to boot, and I felt a little obsessed. We've not spoken since, though I find myself wishing to.
            But
            I realize, that it is not about getting her to like you, or even humour the fact that we like her, but
            to
            actually speak, share, and learn one another: so that you actually like eachother.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I imagine her asking me, akin to her swans, if I like to make things. And I'd reply
            with
            my care for making books, be it from scratch, or via online, and the joy then of formatting, and having
            things to read in whole form.
            <br>&emsp;I'd mention the fact that I love film scores, or soundtracks rather. I also like to edit these
            songs, and either combine them or cut them up in premiere. One such thing is slow motion, where you take
            a
            song, usually with a string/violin, and slow down the track speed/rate. "And it sounds so nice."

            There is an interest in all of us, to see, be seen, and by that, connect, and through that, be trusted.
            <br>&emsp;But earning this is no small task; as our natural keeness for this can see us rushing
            headlong, or
            at least yearning prior to entry; making the approach a hasty one.
            <br>&emsp;What I see, is that we need only be ourself, and offer that for whatever corresponding return.
            <br>&emsp;I see then a girl, whose name is Vienna; and indeed, she feels like a whim of the past. Only,
            I
            can see, as grounded as I'd been with Simron, but with a sort of reproach to our insatiety, that we are
            oppertune for one another. I won't compare myself to other's, but I can say, by the very fact that she
            likes
            movies, and in telling me so, was interested in whether I did, and that she makes Oragami, 'for which I
            can
            only propose is a reflection of similar interests', that because of this, I feel fair and drawn to give
            my
            own cares, be it in reading, writing, the clouds; and the almighty reverence for film score, 'but the
            all
            too consistent retreat from letting such be known': to her I'd share.
            <br>&emsp;But this is not so mucb about her being this grand persona, of which we are so enambered with
            and
            finally in sight of. She is simply one, who by our openeness and liberty, and with delight to share. And
            of
            all things comfort and sex, ought these been seen like meals, in that, of things good and worth sharing,
            'ought you primarily wish to share a meal, and be together as that'.
            <br>&emsp;The cause of this inquiry is such to color our humility and temper, 'for we do wish for
            dessert'.
            <br>&emsp;I am etched with a manner then that I have been embellished with in the past; namely, that
            weary
            pitch towards written definition. Truly, this may, and surely has, gone to far. But, I see, that the
            main
            component of that harsher side, is one where the motions are guided by a fear and or retreat from
            abscence;
            and the according effect of forcing work. While the component of the finer side, is one where the
            interest
            at hand is a fair one, 'and as one near and lifted by the clouds may wish to better see them, so do we
            in
            our current strides wish to take them fully'. The difference being, that we are not simply training our
            calves so we may run, rather due to nature's pull on me, 'and our care for the scenery around', so do we
            wish to marble those otherwise driven strides. "For we are in either case forthgone, and right thus to
            excell more."
            <br>&emsp;As such, we will let our likes wander, 'as they are free to be, and as such, hold nothing but
            their nature, as guided by the wind'.
            <br>&emsp;To round this off, I will state the complexion of liberty; a sentiment which has been long
            trailing behind me. As we have come from the land north, and settled in the meadows once called home.
            But as
            I see this, in all fortune and propiety, that such calmness and joy is not something worth the pretense
            of
            leaving for somewhere else; nor fearing that others may wish you to, or repent while you stay. Said folk
            around may have their own grit and whim, but it is more common than not for them to express their
            withdrawal
            of judgement; at least when it comes to the matters in which we've been irksome about before.
            <br>&emsp;As such, I compare this day to the one's I had as a kid, whereupon our chores being done we
            went
            outside, and with the sticks and yard we had, played. Only through age and a begudged response, did I
            ever
            feel like leaving. "As if there would not be troble outside our coming door." Relating this to the
            present,
            we are indeed more than a child, as we have more than chores which behold us. But equal in that, may we,
            and, as perhaps a release from pretense, are we given permission, if not very little evidence of
            judgement
            being present, as regards our proper treatment of our obligations; and thus sprouting success. And it
            need
            not be said that, like our time as a child, our mature response, albeit similar in form, is one in which
            the
            fruits match the trunk and deed. "To some extent, as a thinking man, doth the world and her wonder lay:
            of
            which, in said field we play." For years mind you I could not help but be drug and irrate about the
            brambles
            and stone in such meadow; whereby our weary strides came to be. Now though, despite the grass stretching
            still as far as the eye can see, am I more near and present to green infront of me. Of which our point
            of
            liberty is founded.

            One of the problems we face is not having anything particularly interesting to share. If someone were to
            ask
            me about something specific, I could ask for days.
            <br>&emsp;But, comapred to most, I struggle bringing things up, and thus resort to bordeom; at least,
            this
            sense of getting through the day.
            <br>&emsp;This is important to me though, as I am not elsewhere occupied, in relation particularly. I
            don't
            seek sex or validity truly, but I do wish to make friends and connect.
            <br>&emsp;The first start is to ask someone about their day. How's it been, how's there shift, anything
            new
            or exciting their up to, in past or to come. This is a great deal breaker, as our aim, for them, and
            from
            us, is to talk about ourselves.
            <br>&emsp;I look at Sam then, or Reza, and I see our relationship differently. As we are all together,
            and
            things tend to land on work. "We are already talking enough." I would relate then, if a the moment comes
            to
            pause, that for them and someone like Josh, to ask them how long they've worked here, if they plan to
            stay.
            Something simple like that. For in Joshes case, or someone like Adi, I don't really care to make a
            friendship with him. "He lacks pretty eyes." But I do find the commradery fair, and instead of awkwardly
            sitting there, simply ask things about himself: beginning with work. For anyone who has not caught your
            eye,
            or your not on some relevant basis, do as such. "For you at least have some common ground." Even offer
            past
            work. This is similar to someone's heritage, which I think extends beyond the point, where work would
            suffice.
            <br>&emsp;In short, for those you can't compare things with, like gaming with Joey or Tristan, or Andi
            even,
            'who you could ask what he's playing', so for those who you wish to relate to and otherwise connect, ask
            about their day. If that makes you too nervous, regarding Amon for instance, either remark the fact that
            she
            is not someone you have any stake for, like Vienna. You may notice her, but feel free to let her pass
            by;
            and accept when she does. If your alone together, bring up work. In Vienna's case, smile, say hello, how
            are
            you, and if there is a moment, ask her about her day, how it's been, what her shift is. This is enough
            to
            talk as were pleased to; and affords any natural point for further discussion; regarding her oragami
            perhaps, and whether or not she makes more. If that is in fact an interested question, then speak fair
            and
            natural: for I need not know so quick or with haste.

            What ought our judgement be? If it be in suspense, while we tend to our own matters, is this fine? Or
            ought
            we be incensed, or stirred at least, by the objects which warrant our judgements being so?
            <br>&emsp;For it is one thing to say, that if we don't act, as corresponds with judgement, then we will
            feel
            the consquence. "Be it in pain upon the wrong choice, or a benefit from the right one." And it is
            another
            when we say that such effects are not only probable upon us, but to others.
            <br>&emsp;Where I stand then, is as one who has been bombarded with judgements. And despite their
            occurences
            being less constant than I'd admitt, or would ever in the past, so are they more or less present
            throughout
            the times prior, 'be it in scorching heat, or mere sparks of flame'.
            <br>&emsp;And so, from this, I have been driven out of life's common way; at least, where those
            judgements
            rose from. And as such, I formed our own custom and according end. That, and we marbled ourselves with
            the
            means to overt further judgements. Indeed, this element holds the heart of our many regards; as we are
            not
            always so sure of ourselves, and by that, able to let incoming contentions slide. Nor is it always clear
            why
            such inputs are worth overting from; be it in a manner of rebuke or disdain. What I'd say, is that
            someone
            who offers a point in haste or with a gust of conviction and certainity, looses my receptivity not on
            the
            basis of who they are, as if they weren't someone worth listening to in principle, but instead, within
            their
            elated claims, 'too little was said, or at least not enough to warrant the concenrs based on their
            prediction, nor our need to care for such matters'.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, our entire adolescence has been spent parlaying this problem. For how do you know that
            their statements are off? Is it so purely on their manner? Cannot someone scream that the sky is blue?
            <br>&emsp;Of that I can say much, but I will be simple, and in short, remark how our sensibility had
            always
            been their in youth, as it most likely is for all: and in a prevailing manner through our later age.
            Only,
            despite the claims of others never being convincing, or at least clear in their merrit, so there lacked
            an
            alternate truth. It is so easy to ignore and or refute someone if your mind is elswhere bade; but not so
            much, or so easily rather, if your mind is absent, but for this new suggestion. And indeed, no one's
            mind is
            so empty, as you hear things through your early days, and in basic matters, form some conception
            yourself;
            which indeed explains some of our overtness in youth; as for the things coming in, in suggestion, of
            such
            ideas we already had some; 'of which our un-collesquence of them is not so mysterious'.
            <br>&emsp;But beyond that, we were really with convictions of the basest sort, and very little when it
            came
            to the more complex matters of the world. "In our aims at least." Per our history, we lapsed into
            nothing,
            bearing little of what was said, but holding nothing but our basic self. For whatever reason, whatever
            was
            there, lead me to actions which corresponded with someone who, cirucamstantially, was only of
            themselves,
            and in particular, of someone whose self was kindly fashioned: as I, and many others, would remark my
            younger years before.
            <br>&emsp;And we come then to this point, whereby someone offers you something, an idea for instance,
            and
            you don't accept because you hold some other belief, but because what is being offered isn't worth
            listening
            to. Ultimately, your idea of what would be right, or remark something worth admitting, or at least
            humouring
            to a good extent, come's from things you've come to believe prior. "As if some sort of sensibility and
            reserve was rooted into your baser rungs." And I'd say, that despite this kind and wholesome base, as
            bed
            and bound through my early years, that of the broader matters of life, in which my sense was absent, so
            were
            we with nothing upon our overtness to what was given. "For all those older and mature, having learned of
            things that I had not yet been exposed to, offered me such insight prior to me meeting them: as if to
            prepare me, in principle and advantage." I will not say much about their suggestions regarding such
            coming
            matters, only, that of the matters to come, so were my concerns of them different. For in many ways,
            such
            concerns seemed rooted in the desire for certain things: a desire which I little held. "And the
            contention
            that arose based on our lack of action, was so, not on the validity of such actions --as I felt-- but
            rather
            the point of them, whose ends I did not care for."
            <br>&emsp;From this, we were left with no ends whose actions we'd find warrant in doing. And much of the
            dissaray in our life came from this fact: that we in effect did nothing. Much of our depression and
            doubt
            was born from this also.
            <br>&emsp;Bringing this together then, we have someone who, by their genial upbringing, the turmoil
            which
            rose throughout by those rearing, and our otherwise blend of honest and kind regard, led me to feel
            unresolved in the mighty efforts esteemed for common ends. We never let go though, and always held
            ourselves
            responsible to this abscence, 'never pretending like things were well'. We dreamed, and in part via
            narcotics; nor were we lacking stubborness or recklessness. But as time went on, 'where our empty
            placement
            amidst the common path threw us about', that so did we at subsquent points amend. Be it our parents, our
            resolve in life, and further things of the sort.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, where I've come from and how I am, is born through this process. All though, to this
            matured and current point, 'about how I should be in our current place, as one so esteemed and free: yet
            lacking the kind of resolve and cares that others of similar esteem do'.
            <br>&emsp;I find it hard to say whether my completion bades such intent, or if we are merely to further
            refine our personal state, and from there, 'fully proceed'.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed the problem of philosphy lies, 'as the truth ought bring you to the point of all
            things: or
            maybe it levels you ought to begin'.

            So, 8 hours is the max. I'd rather not work at 9, but the earlier shifts are less likely. I think that 5
            is
            the earliest, though 9 is fine too. In that, we've got 10-2 as the end range. It is either 5-1 or 6 till
            2.
            I suspect if we the former we will get less shifts. And I am inclined to get enough, even if we start at
            9.
            I think that were less likely to get any in the early hours, as there are simply not enough; and likely
            taken by others.
            <br>&emsp;I simply want to work more days, and keep it to 5 hours. Two days is rather sufficient, as
            would 3
            be. We seem to only be getting the 1 morning shift; which is nice, but leaves me a little bit kept to
            ourself. Which is fine, but the idea that we could see others, and connect; with Vienna namely, is
            important.
            <br>&emsp;Right now, our availability is monday, friday and Saturady 3-1, and this is gaining me full
            shifts. I don't mind them, but prefer short, and more of them.

            I notice that when our food reserves fall, the aerobic load on us makes me ill. There may be fat

            also, but this ought supplement your normal glycemic load. Otherwise, your body must transition to
            ketosis,

            The reality of civ is that victory requires nothing more than the specified means to an end, and the
            general
            basis to faciliate this.
            <br>&emsp;It is now known that the legacy paths influence such ends very little, but instead contribute
            towards their faciliation. Economics for instance, has the purpose of providing more gold, which may be
            of
            interest to you for purchasing buildings and or units throughout the game.
            <br>&emsp;It is worth noting that the legacy paths do have rewards that allow such faciliation, be it in
            skill points or strict perks. Exploration science for instance can provide 3 culture per quarter, giving
            a
            nice boost to your early modern development.
            <br>&emsp;In that, as we play, we ought consider our end. If were going for Railroad Tycoon, then we
            want as
            many settlements and resources as possible; along with more gold as to purchase buildings to get the
            factory
            points going.
            <br>&emsp;Culture is relatively simple, as you only need to build explorers. You will need to reach the
            end
            of the main civic tree to unlock more artifacts, so having a fair culture is good.
            <br>&emsp;It also cannot be overlooked, that beyond potential boosts, that competiion can result in war,
            and
            thus you need some basic semblence of science in order to keep up with military; and culture adds ontop
            of
            this.
            <br>&emsp;For science, you merely need that, plus several cities with solid enough production to do the
            projects, and then the rocket launch. I believe Fascism offers a boost to projects, and perhaps a wonder
            does to, or civic at that.
            <br>&emsp;Dominion is it's own bag of tricks, as you must have a different ideology than your
            competitor. At
            least, if you have the same, then you need to capture 10 settlements, whereas, if their different, then
            you
            only need capture 5. This can be planned for, as you eye a smaller target, deliberatley wait and choose
            an
            opposing ideology, then assualt them.
            <br>&emsp;The reality of civ, in summary, is that all these things can be achieved with relative
            simplicity.
            But, the truth of the matter, is that low science, gold, culture and production drag down your means to
            do
            so, making it a slow process. Anyone can win a game of civ, in this version or the last. But doing so
            well,
            and with pace, requires a good deal of development. This is what the game is for, as doing well means
            you
            can linchpin victory; or, you will have to take your time, and find means to increase your pace.
            <br>&emsp;I will note, that resources play a huge role in your civilization. If you mean to play off
            happiness, then you want as much wine and later on furs for the corresponding celebrations. If your
            playing
            military, then you want lots of silver, and teas in modern age if your going for science. This benefits
            from
            settlements and or trade, and reflects a very directed approach through the game; as you can look at and
            prepare for later needs. Wonders are no different; the colossus for instance, and it's boon of gold;
            along
            with Monks Mound, and both their resource increase, for the sake of more factory products.

            So, be it in the civil realm, or military one, injury and or misfortune of other's is a hard pill to
            swallow. For you see them hurt, or at least in pain, suffering and or begrieved. And it is hard, 'like a
            wounded animal who you cannot aid', in being so near, yet so far and unable to intervene.
            <br>&emsp;This is the promise of literature then, or media rather, as to both show what is so far, and
            through that, elicit some response 'for those who'd deem themselves otherwise far away'.

            some
            degree practice, effective; as it is so, that a penny into the stock nudges every so much.
            <br>&emsp;The point then is not that our actions should be dissauded and or perrmited to dismiss far off
            concerns, or at least those whose impact by us is penny like; but we ought remain rational and
            controlled,

            I think deep down, we are all with the opinion that we have some true ideal; and when we see things that
            conflict we that, we deem such things wrong, and the perpetrators as bad. For we have so much experience
            which tailors us, and like pasta being unwound and sifted by a hand, 'so doth books and media lay'.
            <br>&emsp;The question then, is why are our own views so combative against the appearence of others? Is
            it
            so much that the holocaust was worht our sympathy that we feel merely so, or is it the wrongness which
            spurss us; to be deemed so, and thus replaced by our apparent truth.
            <br>&emsp;For I do not know how many rights we should have, whether women and men are different, and by
            that, deserved different treatment. Nor do I know the proper conduct of things, or, as regards
            providence
            and death, how we should remark and prepare. "This world has never stopped being a mystery."
            <br>&emsp;But I lie then, exposed to the conservatism of Arabia, the authority in China, the esteemed
            hold
            of Putin in Russia, the chimeric depratvities of Africa, nor the bearuacry of the developed world. The
            question though, is whether we should admitt ourselves to this complexity, and offer a sort of
            developement
            to it, as to further progress what is ideal and true, and by that, slim down the impurity of these
            things.
            Or, ought we apply ourselves to the wounded, to the fires raging? In many ways, all services operate on
            this
            level; as one in need of a bacon burger is alike one in need of suturing: the difference though, is
            despite
            the value domain, one is on the novel side of comfort and treatment, the other on the end of pestulence.

            The deepest thing I know, is that if I remain unoccupied, then I will think or act in accordance with
            stillness; and from that, orient ourselves to some potential future; as if to ideally, or in remedy,
            paint a
            time beyond our solitude.
            <br>&emsp;In being at work for a short while, I can see how having something in mind, regarding
            itinerary
            and effort that is, is an adornment to our lives; along with seeing other people, and the common peace
            that
            comes from seeing others and being known, and the more lively matter of desiring and or seeing from our
            active time.
            <br>&emsp;In acceptance, I somewhat malign myself with futile intent. All the while though, I admitt
            rightly
            of the liberty in this lane; whereby we see how, fairly, and in practice, we see outward from this
            ordained
            spot. "While our unoccupied state has no such position, and thus feels embalemed to all: be it in
            imposition
            as our brace upon the world squanders; or in rigthoues probitity, whereby we overt our indolence and

            our
            set and governed state holds a sort of measure, by which all things see are impressed upon our arranged
            state; and do not draw us to be arranged per the impression, as when were not arranged aleady.
            <br>&emsp;There is a simple truth then, that who I am and am pleased by, comes from a sort of denial of
            all
            things absent or contrary to what I feel dear. "I care not for your guidance in which I'd recieve a boat

            I do not contend that our understanding and views of things is entire. And as I'd listen to a doctor
            regarding an illness, so do I hear from those learned in all fields about the matters in such fields.
            Those
            on televsion are merely members of their respective breed, and can offer some semblence of their
            according
            domain. But it is not so difficult to see, that of the direction and ways of televsion, that so are
            those
            matters (as per the one, in a domain, regarding the according matters), given in extent and gait, by
            such
            according ways. "T.V does not bend itself to the content, but the other way around."
            <br>&emsp;In this, I will say, that I've read the histories, and can state the general development from
            matter to the globe; from Eukaryia to man, and Rome to Modern London. There are holes in my sight, along
            with strands which are but a glimmer. But I will say, by virtue of sense and our principle in being
            reserved, that what I see on T.V, and online media too, is of the words and pleas of those representing
            us,
            the people. Their actions, or at least the actions which correspond with them, are not absent either;
            but
            this may be best described as a conclusive resolve. "As one may seek a change of sort, and pass some
            sort of
            policy or alteration in conduct, of which we can say their attempt is bade." But the thing which
            Televsion
            does so poorly, and is by my accounts found fully only through more deliberate measures, is how such
            resolves actually effect the world. For it is so hard to speak to any one person's circumstance; and
            even if
            you do, how this remarks other peoples lives. It is hard to appreciate people's means to bear load,
            handle
            burdens, and otherwise make do with what they have.
            <br>&emsp;I will give an instance where Television offered something, yet gave little of which you would
            be
            best to receive. They stated, that from last year, assaults against paramedics had risen by 40.. They
            did not mention any actual figure, as if it went from 70 to 100. They mentioned not what the increase
            was
            from the year prior; for the average yearly increase may have been relatively low, indicating a sudden
            shift, or it may
            have been rising in comparatively high numbers for several years prior. In a word, they spoke to a
            problem which had
            some potential cause; and that this was a point of evidence in that favour. To me, this evidence lacks
            supporting points
            to see a) what it actually is, as you don't know actual amounts, and b) the actual significance of this
            problem, for if
            it was 7,000 to 10,000, then I'd say the issue was astronomical, and only increasing; while it being 7
            to 10 is not so
            earthshatering to me.
            <br>&emsp;Ultimately, Donald Trump has imposed Tarrifs on Canada, effecting us Canadians and Americans.
            Whether that is
            for the better of his country I do not know. But of all the effects upon us, which are basic rights are
            a kindred sort,
            so do all causes apply. And from that, my cares are onto people and the quality of their experience, not
            the actions of
            those who, fairly, but also thrugh esteem, create much impact. Donald Trump has not rearranged the bulk
            of America's
            laws, and we ought rememeber that the effects of those is not to be forgotten. In some sense, and I say
            this while being
            coy, but it seems that we almost forget this fact because, of all the causes upon us, we care little of
            their evident
            and or supposed effects. "We just go about our day, adjusting as we do, and finding the good upon our
            stability: which
            is something that is not itself given, but ours to partake upon our more obligate actions." We forget
            this though, and
            upon hearing some new impediement, think we'll notice or care any more than we do of the things already
            long by our
            side. "Will this not be similar."
            <br>&emsp;I don't know where this hatred in our hearts comes from. I suspect it lies in the similar
            tangles of our wish
            to be right, and make sure other's know it. The point is not to admitt and or ignore the acts of other
            people, 'be it in
            thiefs or depsots', but not to let ourselves to be unravelled and blinded, 'as if such people are so
            dastardly as we
            deem, or are the soul problem of the world'. I simply have no mature and or respectable approach which
            sparks such an
            attitude in me. The world is simply too complex to, upon consideration, hold such anger and or according
            response. Nor,
            in the deeper and or natural impressions, 'by records and being outside', am I eleicted to even see such
            a response as
            neccessary. "For there is generally not much going on, besides those points where it is. And typically,
            it is car
            accidents and domestic dispute: which in my view, is not so easy to blame the president for."

            Our way of life is such, that our expenses are small, nor our demands a burden. We've made choices that
            have
            brought us close to our family. And despite this reflecting a younger position, so have the years
            brought me
            in and out of such things; and to those times when I was on my own, so were the circumstances similar. I
            am
            employed, with peers, a schedule, and a generous regulation of our mode of living; as to faciliate our
            interests, and peacefully oblige such employment.
            <br>&emsp;This course of ours came from the north, where we spent much time living in peace and
            stillness.
            This was shuffled when we moved back to our younger home; but through some time and effort, the peace
            has
            returned, but with more welcomed activity. The lands are getting warmer, our leisure is coming about,
            and
            our means for study and creation are only getting clearer and stronger.
            <br>&emsp;I see that we are indeulably lucky, for we live in Canada, are at liberty to be passive in
            conquest, submissive upon another's. We pay taxes and are subject to laws (and consequent penalty), but
            so
            do we receive an array of services, along with a realm of economy as to produce things pleasing to us.
            "And
            in that, lies even more oppertunity, to discipline ourselves, and earn even more pleasing things."
            <br>&emsp;Our way has come from our choices, which have come from choices prior and their ordainment via
            our
            constitution. Such form is hard to explain, though the observations of our developed years show enough
            as to
            either susepct the cause of such points, or at least coallesque with the point of those motions; which,
            however long after produced from some far hidden truth, are themselves a far memory, and more fair to
            consent to; as if they were the base.
            <br>&emsp;For all my writing, I see little which has enveloped this present point; for in some ways, it

            the thing which goes unspoken, and in it's obscurity, and the rleations of the world around which are so
            accordingly unclear, so of those things do we state: but not the thing which their obscurity was lacking
            clarity for.
            <br>&emsp;I mentioned this shortly ago, but the basis of me is that I hold on interest or care that is
            born
            under obligation; as if some things are good as they are in relation to a burdened state. Nor, do I
            admitt
            anything as being futile or false, as per the norm, some burden will forbid it. My experience is that
            most
            of our burdens are made up, not on a reasonable basis, but by our lapse of action as would produce the
            goods
            we truly seek. But, via tradition and its flakes of ignorance, so are we stirnly told, and in that,
            emablemd
            with our derisive response; which, in effect, only leads us away from the esteemed truths pressed upon
            us.
            "I never held such things in esteem; and thus ran no where."
            <br>&emsp;I could be more clear, and over time will, but I will say, that of that last point, so is the
            relevant fact, that in our un-submisson of the esteemed truth, and our lack of movement elsewhere, that
            we
            bade ourselves in such a stilled stated as to see what was better and true; as such a way was
            motioneless,
            and thus lacking of any comfort or good, nor lacking doubts and or contrition from others. We were
            motivated
            thus.
            <br>&emsp;Thus lies our adolescene, where we admitted none of the burdens around me, nor held any
            complete
            truth of what was either a) good to seek, or b) a means to do so.
            <br>&emsp;Our choices though, as reminsecent of our lack of fufillment in such a way, as some moments
            and
            places in it were not so developed or pleasing, were made along such lines; and via our lack of
            satisfaction, and the lingering sense of shame and contempt by others --who say me doing nothing, even
            in
            our finer states-- lead me to live with our goal in mind, but with respect to the deeds neccessary to
            provide for it. Indeed, the root of our adolescence was in the nature of wish, which was to be as we
            often
            experienced, in flourishing pleasnentry, and how in such ways, we were entirely alone. Naturally, we
            were
            raised and acquainted in and to a home; and of such place, we sought never to leave. There is a prickly
            truth to this, in that, of our cares, so were we protective of them, and by that composure, timid and
            meak
            regarding other potential things. But alas, in our reserved interests, so did we merely wish to be at
            home:
            for we beleived nothing else was required.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, our choices have led us back home. And of the good we seek, so is it evidently
            squanced by our inacitivity and lack of occupation. For in that, we feel unrightful in our place at
            home,
            and a little pathetic accordingly. Much of my years have felt like this, and although not so prevalent,
            so
            do the strides of dreams and glory come up, 'as if to assure us of some future beyond this anxious
            habition'. But alas, we are home, employed, making some money, for novel purchase or later saving. We
            are
            quite kept and aligned to our homely deeds, and personal desire.
            <br>&emsp;Were going to fail again though, as our time often bids. You see, in our inactivity, there
            lies no
            romance or friends. And by that, we are ever too aware of ourself and things, and prone to irrate
            perfection; as to validate our belonging, and furnish our solitary ease.
            <br>&emsp;What I would say, is that life has many ends, and of the weeks near and ahead, so ought to
            truly
            amend. For we are off till Friday, and again till the next. Of those shifts they are early, and so any
            weakness in our hunger will have several breaks to deal with. I also think that eating properly the
            night
            before, 'as if to properly fill', can help your short shifts. I mean to run well if not often. We have a
            small stool in order to do pullups, and we may do a whole manner of exercises around this. We are true
            to
            eat more and at least constant, and our yoga is quite ordained to our sense, and proactively so through
            our
            coming guides.

            We are left then with nothing to speak about except for desire. As I would absolutely love to gorge my
            face
            right now, watch porn even or smoke. But I know, that in our fortuity to the deeds of God and Man, that
            if I
            slunder and sludge my way through that, then I will not ever reach what I mean to succeed.
            <br>&emsp;Where the trouble lies, is when I have no such view of success, but am rather emabalmed with
            the
            peace from stability, and the glowing edge and it's light. This has succoured me for an age. But we
            still
            keep on, denying that we seek romance, 'as if our love of the sun ever matched that of a woman'.
            <br>&emsp;If we choose to eat junk, be it in long term complacence or short term consent, so will we
            slacken
            our means to work; in both action and composure. "Either our back will give more easily, or our nerves."
            And

            So our judgements are parsed on the accounts we give of the world.
            <br>&emsp;This is not to say that were so tight and set on such accounts, 'as if we had, or at least
            knew,
            some rule of nature which goverened our walking, and the basis of the ground below'.
            <br>&emsp;But we are left with someonewhat contrary opinions, from near and far.
            <br>&emsp;And oddly, this is not a familiar experience to most, as the matter of truth has always been
            more
            or less equal to all. There was fighting and or progression, 'but from a level acceptence'. Indeed,
            man's
            notable flaw is being so sure, yet bearing results which reflect not.
            <br>&emsp;By that, it fairs one most to be able to state that they approve; for the abscence of
            another's
            understanding of what you feel to be right or wrong, means that you must be forthcoming in your belief.
            For
            you generally don't have to convince people, but express what your free to see. "In many ways, and as
            regards our parents, this matters most, that the bombardment of suggestions we recived tends to come
            because
            our own mind and feelings seem unmade. It is wise then to be able in stating that your are clear and
            resolved. At least, remarking that you are not unsure of things nor your goal, but perhaps not clear on
            the
            means to reach it."
            <br>&emsp;This may serve you fully, as given your sanctiety to be so sure and accordingly resolved, you
            need
            merely state that you are fine and consenting to your course and way.
            <br>&emsp;But as regards the accounting, whereby you may have to defend your view of the facts, or at
            least,
            in freedom, speak to the fact that of your account of things, you either see them differently then is
            being
            supposed or imposed, and that, as such, any elements your missing are of those which you actually see;
            as if
            the figure I am undefined on is it's own matter compared to the undefintion of some other figure.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, matters of fact may be used to state a prediction; or you may feel some future
            sense
            based on an impression of fact. If you are in a progressive state, which claims little but merely asks,
            then
            you have only your doubts to even; as surrounding absolutists, or those ardent in their views, can make
            your
            own uncertain approach a weary one.
            <br>&emsp;Similarly though, it must be that the past and present blend together with the future; and
            thus,
            if an observation is had, so ought prior one's not be forgotten. Nor is it sound or likely that if we
            were
            grappling with past observations, that we'd be in a state that needed recall; for new observations would
            be
            put ontop of our weighed down state; rather than being something later used to calm our alerted
            reaction.
            <br>&emsp;And again, the world is exposed to me in ways, that in their fine properties, so am I
            unacquainted
            with most of it, nor with delight in the matter. This is true. But this is not our common world being
            hit by
            the embers of the world around, but our far off scope heeding the glimmer of nearer and more
            concentrated
            rays. It is not pollution or a disturbance, merely an expression of certain facts and our own percepton
            of
            judgement.
            <br>&emsp;At the end of the day the news is so, that of the world we live in, so are chocies, by menace
            or
            not, made to others good or not so fortune. Our own case is by natural privalage or local decree fine.
            But
            so is there something true in the reaction to potential conflict or the trauma of someone injured afar,
            that
            reflects our own aimlessness; or at least the flatness of our progressive mean. So it offers me well,
            and
            perhaps, in the whole of entirety, reflects old nerves and current insolidity, that we are so put off by
            the
            very (albeit course) presentation of this fact. "That things are not so entirely well."

            It is clear right now, that our 'progressive approac' is nobly esteemed, yet, not so conclusive in it's
            end.
            Be it through education or active service, our goal ought be one that is real and definite. The progress
            is
            in what we offer, not that we would offer. There is no qualm with not offering; our experience only
            shows
            that, per our time and occupation, so do we feel like it; as we find much ground and comfort in learning
            about the world and seeing it for what it is. Glory may have been sought, but only now do we see other's
            far
            away, and with equal regard as someone that we know nearby. "They are both equal in that they are apart
            from
            us."
            <br>&emsp;It may be so that in our reflections that we iron out our judgements and become set in
            something
            full and true. "Indeed a great deal of our time has been spent abasing alterante truths, so as not to
            weigh
            on our lack of sure judgement." But, as much as you are in suspence, and find yourself reflecting in a
            broader way, keep an end in mind, or at least point of it all. "Not so that you would in fact be so
            occupied, but in the form of your remarks; that they would hold some course on route to the truth." It
            seems
            to me, that such truth is what you seek because you lack your own understanding. "Which by fortune and
            state, is ours to have." Yet, our lack of clarity there, yet bond with it in terms of what is near and
            of
            such a form in me, makes for our seeking truth, 'as if to offer guidance and or repell input around'.
            <br>&emsp;Our time then, by our way and concern, is from, and with reciept from, reflection and real
            inquiry: whereby the end is both sought and maturely approached: and not, as it's been, too enclosed on
            one
            or the other.

            I'd state that there is not but our quest for right and wrong. But such a feat comes by our indefined
            measure of good. I sense it, in many ways know it, but cannot fully exclaim; and thus our oppertunities
            are
            less gripped, nor impositions upon us so easily passed off.
            <br>&emsp;This is so, for of our roots I do not know. I have admittedly thought little of our youngest
            years, nor our true strides in youth. All I have stated, and have more clarity to remark, is the result
            of
            such motions: the culmination of how we were raised.
            <br>&emsp;For in that rearment to took to so little. And due to the reality of such rearment being one
            of
            indpenedment oblige, so was the matter of that oblige a weight upon me. Our rearing was, so for
            neccessity
            and further benefit, we could accordingly oblige. But as that time came, 'where we were off to the
            wilds, or
            at least to the further means in preperation', we were ill-resigned.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, in being in such a grown up state, and in the world as corresponded with that, we
            were
            so ill-fit. I duly obliged, living as I could without respecting such deeds, and otherwise consenting to
            them as I could.
            <br>&emsp;It would seem that the world demands something of you, and be it as a farmer who get's by, or
            a
            king who holds much in excess of that, so must we oblige.

            So we were young once, and quite set in our deeds and ways. I recall not all things feeling so
            weightless;
            but our sense onf consequence was rather bare. I did feel certain elements, maybe during one small
            aspect of
            school, or some chore at home, in which there were stakes in the matter. But besides our behaviour, we
            were
            generally free.
            <br>&emsp;As we got older though, beyond pride and our sense of what was good and proper, so did we
            begin to
            feel the effects of our efforts. For in school namely, our grades were something we had to present
            almost,
            'and more or less prove that we were doing things well'. Later on, we were equally pushed to get
            employed;
            be it for money or life skills; or to remove this sense that --during the summer for instance-- we
            weren't
            doing anything at all.
            <br>&emsp;Despite our weakness in all of this, and our admitted lack of complexity (in this reflection),
            I
            can say that our views of most things, be it cars, university or girls, was such, that of the route
            towards
            such things and the involvements which procurred them, so were we not bethrothed to any of them in and
            of
            themselves. There was this pressure to do so, in both our cynical doubts and scoured expressions from
            those
            near to us; and thus, that idea of enrollment and a plan felt like a token as to not be so scowled upon.
            "But it became so, that this sense of liberty because we were so rightfully invovled, gave no way to any
            constance or committment to such things: as we were stubborn in doing things for the sake of it: nor
            absent
            of other developments as time went on."

            Hey Dev, just had a question regarding availability. I've seemingly hamstrung myself in looking for 5
            hours
            shifts ---or not the full 8 ones. I understand that you can pick up shifts, but that's random. I'm not
            concerned about money, but I've enjoyed seeing everyone at work, and having the 1 shift per week feels
            like
            I'm never seeing any of them.
            <br>&emsp;I'm thinking of just opening my schedule to everyday, while keeping the limit on short shifts.
            I
            know this cuts me off from shifts I'd otherwise get, but I hope by doing this I'll get more than 1 per
            week.
            The few weeks before this I was getting two 5 hours, and that worked great.
            <br>&emsp;I bring this up because were limited in availability requests. My understanding is you get 5
            per
            year. I'm wondering if my initial availbility input counts towards that, when I was first hired? Do I
            get 5
            more after that? Also, is it 5 requests a year from the day you start, or just till the end of the year?
            If
            I started in November, and I did several requests, does it repeat January 1st?
            <br>&emsp;Overall, I'm really enjoying my time in the department. Everyone is great, and as I said, I
            would
            just like to see them more. And despite having my own personal efforts and things to do, working 1 shift
            per
            wekk still feels too little. It seems that these past shifts I've been doing grocery picks, which has
            been
            great. I know that produce is a very delicate thing, and that certain folk hold your trust to do so. But
            be
            it for fridge, freezer, grocery, large or cleanup, I'm equally able for each. And I also don't mind
            doing
            the backroom if that's what you need.

            We tend not to do this anymore, those whole feeling regards. For such remarks tend to come in strife,
            'whereupon our foundation is under load'.
            <br>&emsp;The years have been kind to me, and our baser mentions have ceased.
            <br>&emsp;We are to go in at 430 this and the following Friday, and then at 6 the following. We are fine
            and
            able to do this.
            <br>&emsp;Our health is such, that in our might, we are feeling higher; if only from the efforts at
            work.
            Our yoga though is murdering our otherwise free-time, and not benefiting either our finer capacities as
            our
            work would benefit from. Our eating lessens because of this, as we care not to eat so much, nor so
            wholly.
            But alas, our common time is fine, in our walks and reading, writing and song. Games, vids and film are
            not
            lacking either. And, it would seem, that our yoga is returning, in both sentiment and furry. And thus
            our
            elected activities are further shining. "As are the near coming's of spring and her bloom."
            <br>&emsp;Choice is ultamitaltey are meaning in life; as we alot our time and effort for something which
            is
            deemed as such. But our judgements, as to foster such choice, are never so clear or tight. And so, per
            our
            way, is it at least deamed good if it prompts and faciliates such inquiries: as to further refine what
            you
            see and know, and thus make it more simple and dear to amend.

            Let us move away from the motions of old, where we thought that, through true and ripe action, that we'd
            be
            part of the world, a leader, one of glory and cheer. Nor, let us be so mistaken to think, that if
            someone
            other, or any fortune for that matter, were it in our otherwise personal life, that such life would
            change
            but for their prescence. "As if this meal had this new item added, yet was otherwise the same."
            <br>&emsp;For it seems, that things of the sort, in all their worth and desire, come by action and
            chance.
            For you ought not press it to be, nor yearn upon its abscence; merely let the chance come up, and let
            your
            words slip as they are calm and pleased to.
            <br>&emsp;As always our life is our own. And indeed, maybe through prior choices we would have procurred
            what we seek now. But such interests are merely of something now, and presently striking. As your wish
            is
            fdufulled, you seek again. And by our sweet memory, and I retain our efforts to compose ourselves to the
            good already had. The moral, is that this reserve, or at least appreciable action, is by its extremes a
            limitation to all other things: as you choose otherwise, or feel to odd to be open about it. But this
            need
            not be so; and in fact, the sense we have of things, whereby we are right and good for the stability and
            cheer in this, gives us room in our hearts to be at peace, but also share. "we ought be happy that we
            are
            proceeding so lightly through the world: but not so remorsed as to the precedent of the world not yet
            being
            ours."

            There is this line, whereby we lean far forward if we are in front of it, or sink nicely into our depths
            as
            much as we are behind it.
            <br>&emsp;The truth though, is this is not some symmatry, but remark about what's realistic for someone
            to
            do. "As some propel themseles into their very depths: the monks."
            <br>&emsp;All I've noticed over the years are the evident matters that leave me whole and flourishing if
            attended to. Accordingly, our regards are nearer to us, rather than those far away.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, this deeper station brings with it a sort of rich cheer: more or less by you
            starting
            from so far down, that your rise is only higher. You may not always see above the surface though, while
            attending to such depths. But, in bearing our regards to such roots, the cares beyond get dissovled.
            "Those
            whose concerns are so far beyond themselves end up needing and or seeking the world. While one with
            inner
            peace finds much joy, and thus calm, in the world outside their door." This is our mature state.
            <br>&emsp;The grandest thing to describe though, is when our equinimity within deeper regards keeps with
            me
            as we partake in farther matters. Quite literally, the life of a monk or philosopher is so, that their
            efforts are committed to themselves; and thus, of people and comfort, so are these deemed contrary. Or,
            in
            our case, 'our choices don't bring us by their side'.
            <br>&emsp;And the point is, like someone who exercises runs better, that so in our common strides, when
            we
            take them from those depths, but in a way that is gracefull with respect to our harmony in such depths,
            that
            the natural motion born of this in the farther domain are such, as to be so commiserate per that domain
            --of
            what is normal there-- but with a sort of candor and life brought up from those deeper harmonies. "A
            painting works this way, in that, of the deeper blends and faded harmonies in the back, the more clear
            and
            detailed objects in the front seem even moreso, and at that better, from the depths they settle upon."
            <br>&emsp;In that, pure sense tells me to bring such harmonies forth; in that, of what your asked for,
            be it
            strenght, or what your drawn to, be it other people or amends, let the embers and hues from beneath
            flavor
            what you offer. "For as such, during conversations, what I care for and am inclined towards, and thus
            apt to
            share, stems from such depths."
            <br>&emsp;As these depths can feel obscure and or private, so do the goods of them become entangled with
            the
            knots they sit upon. "For dealing with our deepest selves can be a messy or at least prolonged affair:
            and
            not one which you want to share." But of such goods, ought they be the elements of your broader aims and
            converse. For instance, the music we listen to is that which mingles, or is at least with our approval,
            in
            terms of our heart and it's motion. Of such heart, so in our finer times did we find music to match
            that.
            But, where the two paths differ, is if our heart is off, we tend to that, rather than finding music to
            either remedy that, or fit into to your lessened state. "No complacent interests or delight from me." We
            may
            hide our care for treating our broken heart, and thus, the music which we care for when it is at peace,
            and
            by our decree towards such peace and the according belief in this being right and natural to achieve, so
            do
            we assume the complexion of our cares, in that, of the heart were tending, and the reservation to share
            this, so do we not share the music we like when our heart is not broken.
            <br>&emsp;My life is such, that of our broken heart, so were we given comforts by our circumstances. As
            we
            were young, around folk who needed little, and so we induleged in such. But when those circumstances
            were
            less giving, we didn't work to earn our own ointment, but rather fix the impetus for it.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, there is a long line of tradition; one in which, of the goods in life, so are
            they
            marshalled under the veil of problems, and the according remedy and or means. Such means were what we
            were
            judged by in our less-dependant years.

            So, taking a vertical slice of my life, I was in my early youth, or at least in an era of youth, and the
            notion of 'the future' and the according responsabilities and preperation for it were becoming part of
            the
            nomenclature. "Like we were being reared for something."
            <br>&emsp;As it were, our idea of success was not in how well we partook in such ventures, or that we'd
            get
            the rewards esteemed by them; but, based on the consquence and shame in not being so ordained, and to an
            extend so rewarded, so were we pleased and happy to be on such path: but for the sake of the path
            itself, in
            that it was one that other's approved of, along with the clarity which came from being on a path at all.
            <br>&emsp;The thing to note though, is that this sentiment was so throughout our growing years, in that,
            of
            a job for instance, we were always elated to get one for the approval we'd get upon getting it: rather
            than
            anything actually offered by the job. And again, this came from the consternaton by our parents when we
            lacked such goals or employment; along with our friends being so ordained, and increasingly effective in
            it.
            Our self confidence also was teatered on this, as we felt somewhat lame and hollow if we weren't so
            arranged; and this kept me closed of to girls and potential friends, as we were more inclined to live so
            poorly on our own.
            <br>&emsp;The truth in all this though, is that our response to all of this was not one of real care or
            achievement, but security, 'as to feel safe that we were doing the right thing'. But in this came much
            procrastination, and an otherwise presentation of us seeming directed. We had not definite goal for
            post-secondary, nor did we care for a job until it was clear that lacking one was unacceptable. I did
            not
            even care for parties and women; at least as I found them. Through the years, I cared only for food,
            movies,
            sports and games. And any of this which had competition or esteem on it, made me step back. I could play
            scrimmage soccer all day: but showing up for an hour long league match had me either full of nerves, or
            longing for the game to be cancelled; and, equally, a relief when the season was over. I just felt more
            obliged than drawn to such efforts. And school and our social life, as it felt so fashionably or vainly
            demanding, had me equally overt. Too, our sense of all this was quite cynical; which I compare to one
            who is
            young and in love, but in being to afraid to admitt it, says the whole idea (or person even) is stupid.
            Procastination indeed.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, circumstance has eroded our natural perspacity in life. As, upon our moves, or the
            eroding of our childhoood cares (along with everyone around), what was new and common delighted me not;
            and
            so, for the sake of preservation, rather than finding some new success, we ordained. And it is not
            unimportant to note, that based on how lacking our interest was, that we made decisions that seemed
            accomodating to our 'wish for preservation'. "Of those and what not around, I leaned away."
            <br>&emsp;And so, our adolescence came to be, as the years of our 'compliant efforts' was no longer
            sufficeinet in their merely complient way. During highschool, we had such pressurs upon us, and be by
            our
            attempts, or the meagerest results, we obliged. But when school was over, so was our wish to merely
            satiate
            the demands from not enough, as the demands were also from the world. Indeed, the motions of this could
            have
            remained as 'complient' as they were before, in that we could have taken some classes at school and
            worked
            part time. But, since we had none of those things, their abscence was more glaring since our grade
            school
            was done. More was expected of me, for we had nothing else.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, we obliged to a certain degree, feeling the heat and emptiness from doing nothing.
            So
            we resolved to go to school. And of our involvement we were pleased. But, the heart of the matter, was
            that
            we were to be dedicated to doing well, as the goal was to earn a degree. There simply was no other
            claim.
            And whereas getting by, 'in our compliance' in highschool felt fine, doing so in college felt mightily
            off.
            As it was so expensive, and the idea that our efforts were a farce had me feeling more deceptive, or at
            least hiding what our parents would be even less accepting of. But, even more importantly, is that upon
            this
            great resolve, the idea that we were not doing anything but for the satiety of the moment, had me
            feeling
            terribly depressed. "As if all of our life, in its fine comfort and pleasantry, had been pushed to the
            side
            for this dutiful resolve. Yet, upon such resolve loosing any of its promsie or solidity, so were we left
            with our formal committment to it, but no real care. And our personal comforts trickled in, acting as a
            sort
            of lift to our otherwise asbcence of desire or interest. And the whole thing lost its reassurance, 'in
            that,
            albeit compliant, we were still doing well'." And indeed, it occurred that of our cares for college, for
            whichever reason it weighed upon me by us being merely compliant, that we felt otherwise poor in our
            personal efforts. They were too often in use of weed and or junk; nor were we exercising as we had
            during
            the year prior. We were just kind old bum.
            <br>&emsp;I had no interest in doing nothing, nor did I fool myself into thinking this was tolerable. I
            stopped going to school, gave more quality and esteem to our personal efforts, and drifted down said
            line.
            At this point in my life, I had only 1 friend, though our family was in relative harmony. There was just
            nowhere I went that introduced me to people. Nor of any potential chicks, did I care for, or feel
            confident
            in, achieving such matters. "And I knew no other women or girls, who, in our more real ways, saw me, and
            I
            them."
            <br>&emsp;The reality of things is that work is not that fun, nor is school some given like highschool
            was,
            but an expensive regime; and thus not to be partaken for the mere pleasure. There is good in all of
            this, be
            it in the security of being on a course, or the actual means that work and a career had. But I cared for
            it
            not. Our roots in the years prior saw me either uninterested or averesed to it; whether by weakness or
            laudible cynicism.
            <br>&emsp;Where I landed then, and how this relates to our current time, is that life, in her candour
            and
            ways, asks that you invovle yourself with her. Be it by employment or contirbution, ought you amend. And
            the
            reason simply, is that your removed from other people, or any sort of regularity in your time, and thus
            ease
            of doing good things and not the bad. As it were, we spent much time being unoccupied, and so, of our
            personal efforts, we militantly dedicated ourselves. But, in the year following, we leaned into the
            occupations demanded of me, but in a way, that of those dutied strides, they were our own, and thus with
            a
            sort of confidence as born from integrity, and also appreication and ease, as born upon our whollness
            and
            strenght.
            <br>&emsp;In this time though, we differed in that our idea of things was much more traditional than it
            is
            now. Our care for things was such, that of the side of things, it catered to myself. But, for instance,
            our
            idea of moving out, held the nomral complexion 'of what moving out required and meaned'. And as such, we
            were tasked with working more. But I'd remark that, in our difference, or unqiueness, that we were so in
            that, of our efforts, be it in fun or ambition, that of the goods in that which we meant to acquire, we
            sought none. For there was nothing in my life which I wished to improve or get more of; and thus excite
            our
            progression in careers. Nor did I have much which gave excitment upon our employment being done. The
            years
            prior had fostered me little of this; nor, of the nature of such things did I really wish for more. I'm
            talking about going out with friends, smoking, having such fun. But the whithering in our prior years
            and
            the according flatness upon our first college try, had me resolute in our personal affairs, akin to one
            who
            turns to religion and God. For me it was health and study, as to be formative, but also foundational.
            For
            the early efforts of these, which excited me by there lauded basis, bore so much promise and evident
            good,
            that I happily disposed ourselves to them. To this day, of ourselves, I marvel in the joys which our
            propiety opens me to.
            <br>&emsp;This notion has never been easy to exclaim. As most around me live with deeds that are more or
            less fair and expected. Yet, in our ignorance of these things, and our otherwise attendance to
            ourselves, so
            our cheerful experience lay. I just have never been able to find any realtions or comfort in such a way,
            or
            meaning at that. All we've had is the quality of that experience, 'like one who is merely endowed with a
            constance of rich scenery'. And what I've learned, is that such a way is not one which needs averse
            itself
            to others, or feel to lessened by any sparks or embers which feel contrary. "A fully incongruent flame
            may
            burn our forest, but a spark merely singes a spot."
            <br>&emsp;So, we came from compliance, to even more so, but with a feeling that such was both not
            sufficient, nor fufilling for me. The alternative though is the heart of our self, and something which I
            cannot fully state. For in this, there lies an aversion, to care about profession or impressing girls,
            but
            to truly be happy. This bundled into a state of pure cynicism, where I was so happy, but overly aware of
            others fault; in either blame, as such faults led them away from me, or in some sort of reassurance,
            whereby
            there weakness' highlighted our strenghts.
            <br>&emsp;Why we were so cynical though, was that we had no friends or invovlement. Whereas now we see,
            in
            our easy and confident strides, that for good and moral effect, we may create, inspire, educate or
            delight.
            "As we see the world around me, so enamblemd by the simplest chirps and wind, so are we now calm and
            able to
            express this, upon another's curisoity, or our actual forthcoming." But when we were younger, we hid
            these
            facts. All the likely that they were obscure, and not relevant or comaprable to the normal cares. Their
            concerns were of future oppertunity, and the cocnerns associated with that. While ours were about
            ourselves,
            our formation, or sensibility, our matured esteem. I felt I could not share this; and indeed, I was
            upset
            that I could not on the basis that none seemed to relate to me. By merrit or not, I drove others away,
            who
            upon getting close, showed either no interest, or were, upon a small amount share, averse to such
            principles, I choose such ends over them. Indeed, this has create a life of solitude; which I say with
            strenght, though admitt, naturally, and by our (perhaps all to need perfection) of such principles, that
            loneliness was sometimes present.
            <br>&emsp;The major development to follow, was that, in our principled way, we were happy. Inconssitnecy
            wasn't foreign to us, and witout anythign else around, so did we feel down. But, in our discipline and
            familiarity with such ways, we were more or less embalmed with the goods of such principle. Only, I
            always
            felt the wear from work, and how it would either drag my principle away, or at least make it harder to
            pursue those; or, it would presusre me to wish for things, in glory and or gluttony, that were contrary
            to
            our principles. "And only sprung by our toil, rather than any good I believed in." For the first part of
            our
            adolescence my response to this was to overt myself from work: seemingly at all costs. "As you meet no
            one."
            But this became unpleasing or intolerable. And so I tried to amend. And what I found, was that as our
            principles had settled, and the good from them was both better known and innately achieved, that the
            reuqirments of work damned me not. We partook in such affairs with a sort of appreciation for the worth
            (and
            by that need) in doing them. And as such, we furthered our principles as to respect such efforts; as we
            did
            with our private time, in that we appropriated ourself to the nature of things as would see us flourish
            there, that so did I include our employment in such nature. And doing so, felt as assuring and sociable
            as
            it had been in the years prior, but also not a drag on our dearer goods. They melded together, and we
            were
            in our first state of rightoues peace.
            <br>&emsp;This is comparable to our earlier developments, when we came out into the working world with
            flying colors. For whatever reason, our efforts in college ended by our positive resolve not to. And we
            simply went to work, sinking into the position which that afforded; in that we were right at home, with
            some
            regularity, and more sociable. From here on we brought ourselves, in cheer and might. Yet, the duty of
            work
            never slipped me, and the only thing which would soothe it was further good surrounding it. Despite our
            cheer, we still were not open. Not that anyone asked, but we never placed ourselves in an involving way.
            And
            so we still lacked many friends, nor any romance. In fact, from this time onwards, our forray into
            romance,
            'which is fairly esteemed as the ripest good amidst your efforts', failed time and time again. Almost
            certaintly because of our cheer and not anything else. We were not open with people in a truly
            meaingfull
            way; and had we been, our romantic oppertunity may have been mute. But we were quite unaware that this
            was
            needed, and we thought for many years that cheerful repor was enough. "But upon our admittence of
            yearning
            and love, they mirrored me not." I could have been more open with people regarding games, as even in our
            state where we did not, we still did to a degree; and over the years, our only friends were those we did
            play games with, or smoked.
            <br>&emsp;This better explains how we were so well, but by immature privation, or the imbalance of our
            fair
            reserve from unlauded things, but no otherwise offer from our higher self, made for little fun or
            invovlement in our time outside of work and our personal time. And such a road is undoubtedly bumpy; as
            despite haing many practices and what not to do, and an abundance of joy and activity surrounding this,
            so
            was it a state that had little resting comforts, or much room for error. We became a little bolted, as
            if
            such principles and practices were required; but doing so, at least so obstinatley, made me a little
            stiff.
            Indeed, when one's experience is lacking, they can paint themselves a picture, of the promise in which
            their
            merrits forsee ahead, or the rightouenss in what your doing, 'to warrant such experience'. But, oddly,
            in
            these last years, we've beckoned to such whims little, and instead, settled on the strenght of our path,
            and
            merely let its prominence grow. "This also gives a natural openess, to which even the meagerest of
            things
            around you feel more vibrant and worthwhile." Even then though, the limits of this, at least those when
            our
            natural pace is not so tender and pleasant, see me almost entirely pleased, but through the effortless
            abundance in our principle. "Our life had brought us to a point where we could do all of such things:
            yet
            the nature of doing so only further stays: whereby your easy perfection sees you flourish alone: and
            thus,
            with a little inconstancy, you become less than perfect, and more aware of even the minorest slight."
            Our
            dedication revealled it's fairest flaw, when the grand expoundance of our cheerfull good was so remissed
            upon being slightly less so. The value of it was not in question, but that we were expempt from all
            things
            other. Which, in their own fair and simple matrimony, could offer their goods while being amiable to the
            bulk of our principle ones. "For being otherwise alone and perfect, felt unsustainable, fatiguing, nor
            required."
            <br>&emsp;What I found in this more or less balanced state, was that, of myself, in all its rightfull
            and
            pleasing way, that we still felt a far off contempt; as if it were wrong to be content with our
            scenario.
            The issue was not that someone stated something, or I even had a sliver of doubt, but, that of our
            content,
            whereby we amended to the deed of work but also in the good we got from it, that so were these strides
            somewhat unoriented and set towards common objects of the future: a better job, a home, a family. And
            so, in
            being ourselves, which felt like so much and by that enough, so were we a little unerved by our content
            in
            being so: for it did not, outside the potential of constnat motion and lifes changing way, bring us to a
            clear end of those esteemed objects. The irony is, that we were not aversed to these things, nor lacking
            desire, but rather we were so kept in ourselves, that of the joys we had for so long but were so parched
            from privation or worn from embellished work, that so was the equinimity of this so contenting, that I
            was
            more or less fine to let things go. For it was not entirely easy to be so pleased and unabated by work:
            and
            its relation to the rest of our life. But, as a gardener succeeds not in being done, but in overcoming
            the
            concerns of their craft, so were we equally succcssful in our balanced state: but a state which we still
            had
            to show up for, attend to, reflect upon. That is the difference you see, in liberty. It is not a removal
            deeds, nor remedy, but a suprassing, as to make them truly deed like rather than a burden. Your pleased
            to
            do it because it is right, and happy, for the confidence in such path is one your completely embellsihed
            towards. "It is like one who tries to walk across a balance beam, and after repeatedly falling off, or
            stumbling across, you relish the point when you nimbly stride, without care; but not also an abasement
            to
            oyur practice and fidelity, which upon cultivation bears your tender stride. You forget it not, but find
            peace in your strenght, and how easily the diffiuclty is surpassed. It is not easier, nor with less
            risk:
            you've merely improved. And indeed, it is a enditement to our nature and way, that we'd amend ourselves
            to
            such path, as if its tasks, which we were to overcome, were what we merely had to overcome: the thing
            our
            esteem, as born from doing well, is ordained and as such oriented to."
            <br>&emsp;It seems enough that we'd manage our time and affairs, as to be open and well to see the sun,
            walk
            for the moon, bound to fields and read. And despite requiring less, there is still a great commisery
            with
            this in terms of youtube and shows. Music and to a greater extent games, fair similarly. It is also so
            that
            were with people at work, and this keeps are self-esteem in check, along with our ability to
            communicate. It
            is not even unlauded that you'd meet a women, or at least be sparked by one in a simple way. The time we
            see
            eachother may only be enough to afford a moment's pleasure, but so in our approach to work, and erotic
            time
            after, it is nice to have such things in our fair. "For I don't mind pleasing ourselves through natural
            imagery; while those of a virilant and explicit sort feel like drainers to our sight of things." In many
            ways, we have sides to us which have not been explored. And thus, our ability to share them, and not
            otherwise feel nervous, is less accessible. And the fact that of these things, such as music or our care
            for
            professsions and children, so is our lack of sharing causal to us feeling somewhat aury about these
            things.
            "As if they are to be hidden." While sharing them once removes such sense, and becomes something that
            you
            don't mind being known. I feel this way about the outdoors, our care for games, televsion, literature
            notably, and music most of all. When I see Vienna, I see someone I'd share that I used to make books.
            This
            is great, for your defining yourself, and making yourself, in the world your right to be in, known: thus
            removing any burdening sense or restriction which the duty within such a place can elicit. But you
            shouldn't
            confuse this with your means to get more from her: as if your care to share your odd delight is some
            sort of
            leverage, or chance to make her interested in you. "Do you really want to be with her outside of your
            lust
            and, in that particular way, your care to share? If there is more, like your care for literature, or
            even
            something that would take more time, then feel pleased when your given the chance to offer such. But
            don't
            conflate this as if it is staked on some other venture. It is all too likely that your means to such is
            not
            limited by your abscence of gravcious offering. It might be simpler than that, or at least permitted by
            mere
            talking."

            When we are breathing rightly, which is to say deep and well, we are thus able to recover and stretch,
            and
            from there, exercise; which then faciliates more eating and satiety, and thus energy at work, along with
            our
            private time.
            <br>&emsp;For whatever reason, this line of things does not come so consistently. It's clear to see
            where
            were off; but not so much in the proportions of things.
            <br>&emsp;I can't stress enough the reality of sitting on the floor. Its not at all the angle or
            position,
            but the hardness of the ground. I, Ryan Green, who does this so eagerly, found comfort in the softness
            of a
            couch. It is just hard to comparmise though, as being soft, like you are on a couch, does not make it
            easier
            to then sit on the floor. And doing so, be it as a means or strucutral end, faciliates much vibrance and
            rigor into my life. Our joy of reading and writing, craft and film come's to boot. And all I'll say, is
            that
            the demands of our structure and metabolism are so, that of the constance which we are on the floor
            indeulably, that so ought our amends be equal. The issue is not that we'd sit somewhere else, rather
            that we
            don't do the things which make the floor habitable.
            <br>&emsp;Foremost amongst this is exercise, as not doing so brings little vigor to your muscles, and
            thus
            gives you little means to truly recover and stretch. That, and besides the actual strenght of your
            muscles,
            and the brimmness which sees you more easily upright, that so in your exercise do you eat more; which
            itself, brings a sort of energy which our work and leisure feed on. This isn't paramount, but
            considering
            there are things to do, and you do like food for pleasure, along with the fact that you must eat
            somewhat,
            that having not exercised, or at least having a muscular demand, that so does eating become more
            fatiguing:
            which makes you tired, and also unfit for recovery. As you tend to breathe less when you've eaten too
            much,
            as your body is in a sort of lethargic state.
            <br>&emsp;Exercise is a one off though, and needs only be a consistent part of your life, not a frequent
            one. What needs to be so frequent is yoga, whereby we wake up and rise, fold over and or lunge out,
            along
            with sitting upright while we twist our legs, or the mere rinse of child's pose. These motions regulate
            you,
            'and almost neccessarily, as any natural means to recovery and firmness could occur through according
            movements'.

            So there's what I'd like to do, and what, at a minimum I should focus on. As I am not particulalry well,
            but
            good nonetheless. Our energy is fair, though our body isn't bounding to use it. Our feels well spent and
            with a fair amount of interest to come; but we are still uncemented in things, and by that, somewhat
            despondant. I am not to keen for food, and am quite prepared to workout. Our coming shift will be here
            as
            so, and equally for all others.
            <br>&emsp;I ought, at the very least, do our standing, some folds, a chatarange and lunge+twist, along
            with
            hero twists, childs pose, some bridge on all sides; and when were to solid for that, however lugging,
            ought
            we then run, and eat tuna, corn, edamame, quinoa, bread and your morning veg. We can have potatoes, as
            our
            hasbrowns fine. But maybe we'll wait till were in a better state, following decent action.
            <br>&emsp;I would like to do pushups and or squats, but I need not rush for it. Doing your yoga along
            with
            running will keep our system worked alnong with holding some sort of form. As we bring ourselves through
            those motions, we'll be better able to do more movement under load.
            <br>&emsp;Work is fine, though it seems Vienna is young. And like her, I wish for Amon to want me,
            though I
            feel that were confusing want and like. As I am intrigued by many people, even if it's just how their
            pretty. But we ought not wish for or exepct anything from them. Our actions are not likely to procurr
            that,
            nor warrant any confidence in something to come. In the case of Vienna, we thought she wanted something
            from
            me, whihc only then needed my itnerest, and so we leaned into the idea of it all happening. What I see,
            is
            that Amons eyes or that of anyone else, or the cheer and talking to Andy, or anyone for that matter, is
            akin
            to the beauty of the sun, the moon, or your care for all things literature. The difference being, that
            people are not their to undoubtably offer you something. How relationships are formed is beyond me: but
            I
            don't think we dearly need one. We just need to be open, with care, and by that able to see someone; and
            not
            with the promise of further heat and flame. "Our life is to boldened to all the wonders and glares: and
            I'm
            fine with that." In fact, what I see in those rightous yet confused states, is a future where we carry
            our
            action. Despite your 'remedy of seeing all but holding none', so are those things still there; and not
            likely so but in a heated state upon your heated excitment. I see, generally, and upon the tuffs of our
            happy norm, that what we seek is to better judge, and by that, be present in the world, for either
            education
            or our own literal change; and my own writings are merely so as to further define what such actions
            should
            be. If I had to mount some purpose in mind, it would be, in company, to be more deliberate people; and
            via
            the landscape in which you partake and it's natural mystery, so may we better proceed. "Whereby we lean,
            have heard, can simply expout our reason: but for action, not belief: for in that, we have none."
            <br>&emsp;On that count, I cannot say I wish to study the clouds or light. I'm simply to ordained to our
            health and work-life balance. But, I do wish to organize our writings so far, as to line up all the
            philosophy, biography and joy. Governance even.
            <br>&emsp;As for leisure, I'd merely mention the minimum, which is to look for things which attest to
            your
            interests. Not so you may find some, but so you may excite the one's you have. Jurassic Park for
            instance,
            is treating me to the production of the animatronics; and World is now a future watch. Look for these,
            be it
            in behind the scenese or nice analysis. This broadens your otherwise common path, in Allies and routine
            uploads.

            Tis a perfect time to reflect on work.
            <br>&emsp;We went in after some time off, and it was as if it weren't so. We spoke to Sam and Andy like
            it
            were any given day. And she did mention that she had not seen Avi for several weeks; similar to how we
            had
            not seen Andy: who I had a nice talk with. This shows that we are not outed from not being there so
            much; as
            upon being there, it's like any other day. And it was a good one. We were making smiles with Amon; we
            learned that Vienna ---thought I'm not entirely sure about this-- is young. And I came to terms with
            this
            notion of like and want.
            <br>&emsp;Schedule wise, it would be nice if we could stand by it, and let these 'out of the group'
            apprehensions slide. Dev is quite supportive, though I don't really mean to ask if we could be only
            given 5
            hour shifts: I think were going to continue contriving that for us. The 8 hour wasn't poor, and perhaps
            we'll open ourselves up to this; truly, the more time were in the department, the more precadent we'll
            be
            given. Right now, I care for our health and general development; and working 1 shift per week only makes
            me
            feel a little but unstable, as were not that occupied, and thus feel like were waiting for it; rather,
            than
            when there are more shifts, were anticipating it, and in a way, glad while it has not yet come, and time
            flies this way. Moreover, our parents are fine with what were doing, and, long term, I can't say what
            schedule will actaully give me more shifts, as my current 4 day 6-2 only gave me one. Could change from
            week
            to week, so I suspect opening it up to all days will do the same, and likely give you more; and by that,
            give us some ease upon lesser shifts. I just wish for some fuller week, as we had before. Dev mentioned
            that
            our initial request does not count, and so right now we've got 4 more. From what I can tell, there are
            equal
            5 hour slots from 5 and up. The position may vary, and thus make me more likely than not to get
            something at
            some slot. But I see there is room for me at each, especially as time goes on. I don't even want a great
            deal of shifts, just more than 1. Sometimes if it's more great, and thus when there is less we've
            balanced
            out.
            <br>&emsp;I contend that living through the tv or your phone, reading articles and discourse as opposed
            to
            sources and your own writing, puts your mind into a sort of box; whereby the world becomes an arena. The
            country of China is not how it is, in complexity and formation, but a player in the world theatre. This
            igrores the everyday lies, and by that adminsitrations, of it's peoples. Such things being knonw, or at
            least regarded, brings one in line with the fact that things take time, and envelop more mundanely as
            you'd
            expect. I don't refute by this sensibility that unwanted things or contention will occur; only, that in
            the
            way it does, so is it on the same line of nature as a traffic cop issuing a ticket, whereby on the
            street,
            via his official status, and by our orientation to the laws and penalities surroudning this, drawing our
            amends; that so do governemnts correspond across their entirety. "Facts are facts, in an event at least;
            but
            judgement quickly looses anything but a glaring concavity, 'whereby the whole world seems brought to a
            point
            in front of you', and looses any sense of the future as relates to the past." The world is surely
            loosing
            it's fortitude when it comes to energy usage, nor is conflict invincibly absent, nor the economy in a
            constantly flourishing state. But the bones of the world do not change, nor effects everyone equally.
            And
            so, by this complex procession, things move on, and we are either privy to hurt, upset about others,
            still
            appreciative of all that remains, and, for me, indeluably fine in as much as our natural liberty is
            concerned: for we may always subject ourselves to law and blade.
            <br>&emsp;as such, this world will go one, moving to and fro, showing weakness and or glare along many
            of
            it's sides. The whole could wain, in truth, or be destroyed; but those judgements seem more like shanty
            predictions instead of a reality. "In the same way that world has remained very similar, despite the
            gleam
            of conteomporary fashions, that so is it clear to me that it will contine in such a fundemnetal way." I
            understand that in rhetoric and fear, things may occur, however near to us, or prevalent to tohers
            around.
            But I stand, by our own interests and occupation, to the remnance of something, and therefore position
            for
            me to afford improvement. For that, I see the things I care for, the manner in which I'd share, the
            potential means and or forms in which such would be conducted; and also, the freedom and ease for this
            to be
            made and goverend by our liberty, as opposed to fear of not reaching expansion, or achieving esteem.
            This is
            simply my line through the future days of the world: and I am fairly content to tailor the roots, trim
            the
            leaves, and relish the joy in which we treat such: while our mountain of pure happiness is more or less
            un-caught by the murky impressions, nor distraught by any of it's distasetfull reality. I dont recognize
            though, that, of our judgements, in all senses of morality, and also by through our maturity, that
            things
            being so espeically well for me, in circumstances beyond our unburdened liberty, 'where we are not only
            stronger, but amidst things being well', that the extent to which we are fair and natural to enjoy that,
            or
            be pleased at least and accordingly bade, so the root of judgement lay. "For what ought one do when
            death is
            no bane, nor sickness and a dipped economoy? What if there is plenty around, in vibrant simplicity and
            oppertunity? Are such occupations and or delights, in their positive regards, fair to dissolve any
            despair
            of those suffering around?"

            So I see much value in relgion, as early on it can earn you culture, either directly, or for cities with
            wonders ---you get less there on mass, but also get science and gold. The main thing though, is once a
            city
            is converted, which occurs instantly if it has no relgion already, so can't it be removed until the
            theology
            tree is completed. This may be not so, but to a degree, there is some initial permanence to your own;
            waivering though in the benefits you get, while being easy to remake. By that, when there is little
            infastrucutre to build early on, build missionaries, as they can turn your own cities in preperation for
            rationalism, and then convert other settlements, and maintain them. You can also get relics, extra
            defense
            or movement.
            <br>&emsp;City states are better overall, offering bonuses to rural tiles, or hard boost of a certain
            yield per the total city states you have. If you have a science, cultural and economic, you
            get 3x5
            per each yield. Military adds combat similarly, +1 per. This is really solid. With Greece, you get the
            tradition
            that reduces the cost of this venture, along with the 2 point in diplomacy, which adds it's own
            reduction. Like many
            things, certain events trigger skill points, and so, starting with a diplo point is one thing, but you
            may then get a
            another from an event; or simply build the Ginseng Wonder. Also, the military states offer the hillfort,
            which, like
            other states, are only good if you a) have rural tiles that make use of it, and b) you are not going to
            build over these
            with buildings. As it were, production does not stay useful, as you run out of things to make, and so
            having the hard
            culture, gold and science yields remain important. Combat wise, your almost certaintly defending, and so
            the
            inconsistency in which you'd use a the miliatry bonus is small. I say this, for early on, you may
            benefit from killing
            these to level up your generals, and then convert the hard yield ones.
            <br>&emsp;Speaking of defense, it seems that the key point is in what is worth protecting during a
            defense. Enemy
            pillaging isn't to concerning, but rather, that we'd hold onto fortified points, while also having room
            to concentrate
            fire. Channeling enemies in works well then. And you need not fret so long as you have walls; even if
            some get broken,
            others remain a neccessary target. This works with the notion that layering your civilization is
            important, as you can
            support the front lines better, and remove the angles in which your attacked. In many ways, hard yields
            are what your
            striving for, while growth yields are for short term benefit. You ought balance out the interest for
            certain resources
            half way across the map, with the more secure position near your other settlements. You also wont
            trigger the enemies
            aggression, allowing for trade, less need for military. "You'll get the resources then."
            <br>&emsp;It is worth noting that culture buildings get + yeilds per city state throughout each age,
            while science does
            so in antiquity, but then gives 5 One important element is in settling. As far as I know, you get 8
            settlement limit at
            the start of
            exploration, regardless of how little or much you had in antiquity. If you have 5 settlements, and see
            no solid expands,
            then you may invest in those cities as to prepare them for exploration, and leave your settlement cap
            for exploration.
            You'll get +1 at feudalism, likely a +1 in your unqiue civ tree, and then get +2 in the mid tree, and +3
            at the end.
            Plus, you can naturally go 1 over, and likely 2 if your happiness is fine. From this, it is clear that
            there are moments
            to expand and moments to wait. The early exploration rush is one where you grab treasure resources and
            rich pieces of
            land. While, the latter age, upon offering many settlements, is when you prioritize resources for the
            modern age, or
            strategic placement; and this can be so in the far continent, or the little islands through the sea. In
            our Spain game
            for instance, there's a city state blocking the Red Woods, and we may choose to go over there later,
            destroy it and
            settle the wonder. This will require some military, and thus is not something able to be rushed. Nor
            ought we care, as
            we can go elsehwere with our linited settles. It's important to scout; which gives spain an edge as the
            conquistador can
            reveal the whole map. But otherwise, it's important to find other civ's capitals and lands, and
            otherwise see islands
            floating about. You'll meet city states this way, grab discoveries, and otherwise see viable spots for
            the later age
            settles.
            <br>&emsp;In antiquity, as you naturally have less settles or room, and are generally fine to have tight
            civ, you may
            invest in exploration yields, but building great amphitheatres and academies, and going for culture and
            science golden
            ages. Skill points wise, you can only get 2, and so, the yield cards for each costing 2 means you can
            still get an extra
            point. Otherwise, you end up wasting a legacy point, as there's nothing to spend it on. Each building
            will give 2 yield,
            totalling 10 each per 5 cities. If you have 2 resources, plus the 4 base yield, that's 6 total as
            compared to 2. This
            extra 20 culture and science will be quite noticable in the early exploration. Amphitheates gives +1 per
            adj. mountain,
            natural or world wonder. This feels like a way in which our mid game stability can apply itself, in that
            we can see
            where potential wonders go ---as we at a minimum need 7--- then plot where ampitheaters and academies
            will go. Since
            ampitheateres come at engineering, they can be built first, boosting your ability to get culture. For
            the sake of
            Colossus and monks mound, you may benefit strictly, and otherwise get wildcard civic. I am not seeing a
            huge amount of
            interest racing for Colosseum or Theodric civic, as the settlement limit is boosted equally regardless,
            and you may not
            have worthwhile settlements on the homeland. A weak settlement then may be worth less a exploration
            island full of
            resources. Acadmeis come the tech after, at mathematics, and are less hastily needed. The ampitheatres
            progress the
            civic tree for the sake of wonders, while the science tree has nothing but codices to unlock: there's no
            race for those

            So the early game has it's own motions, while the mid game allows time for things to develop. The end
            game
            specifically allows for ampitheatres and academies to be built. Generally, the codices are accesible,
            while
            making wonders can be quite competative. It seems that Oracle and Colosseum last a while, while
            Terracota,
            Theodric and Nalanda go quick; as does Weiyang and Sanchi Stupa.
            <br>&emsp;My feeling is that as you establish your settlements, and you have the culture and science
            buildings possible, that making wonders is important; as getting the legacy points is a game changer for
            exploration. Economics is always easy; though, like most things, you may rush the age.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, your going to get the yields you do, and it is worth valuing the security of a
            wonder
            rather than getting a potential +1 adjacency elsewhere.
            <br>&emsp;Considering you need 7, gate of all nations and Dur-Sharrukin seem accesible, followed by
            Weiyang.
            Sometimes the Ai's production out beats you, so relying on Oracle and Colosseum is swell, along with
            Angkor
            Watt --which seems very uncompetative. Emile Belle is one you can race for; and indeed, get the yields
            you
            can, but don't hold off while something is avaivalble. It is better to secure it when you have the free
            time, even if your not getting another +1 elsewhere. Don't rush Emile in your capital if you have other
            things to do: but considering the wonder race and the value of succeeding, we ought not loose by trying
            to
            get 15

            Some of this may be off, but in general, muscles are more sensitive to sugar, and perhaps insulin by
            that
            measure, as an effect from exercise. But it is load-bearing, or intense exercise which does this.
            Aerobics
            make you more sensitive to air intake and thus oxygen. This is why, when our body is not able to take in
            as
            much sugar, we either wish to work out, or, following an aerobic session, we wish for sugar. As I should
            say, the less sensative means the more simple sugar is required: while being more sensative means you
            can
            intake heartier sugars. By that, if we are simply aerobic, and thus full of oxygen, but only with means
            for
            taking in sugar, then we will still want that sugar since we have oxygen: where we'd be groggy
            otherwise; or
            starving, as our less than promisiung means for sugar --from having too little oxygen-- bade me to eat
            nothing at all.

            It is so easy to be free and happy. In principle, one can harness the remission from problems, by making
            themselves more austere, and by that stronger; as well as using their sensibilities to see either a) the
            worth in the deed, or b) how they can orient themselves, via fortitude or position, to make the weight
            feel
            less. Time and fortune may lower the mass of the weight: but we are never short of means to incorporate
            its
            press, and by all accounts, bear the burden.
            <br>&emsp;For happiness, you may use your privalage, or conjure some at least, to either a) acquire
            things
            of a nice sort, or b) marble the grief of your deeds, by pleasant remedies, or passion --of an immediate
            or
            longed for sort. "This route does not necceasrily remove one's deeds; nor does it emphasize the better
            use
            of them, but making life around better. Even those whose actions seperate them from their current deeds,
            so
            do knew one's come. And even if they have more favorable sides, so do the basic matters of sickness,
            death
            and fatigure remain. Plus, in our prior approach, our composure tends to remove us from the pithy
            irratibilities and strife of the world. While ignoring ourselves for hope and ambition can see us
            subject to
            those squiblings."
            <br>&emsp;Of our happiness though, so an issue lies. For in all our strides, be it privalege or with
            sense,
            so is this merely about us; our time, our experience, our fair and or vicious activity. But so the world
            lies, whereby some folk are not so privalaged, or are burdened with chains of a less natural sort.
            Circumstance even may see pestulance swothing the land, or a community at least. "And like one in a
            herd,
            who runs when a predator is in sight, I can't help but feel my flight is no longer of concern, and that
            we
            rather with sights of happiness: as opposed ot the avoidance of it's contrary: a positive interest
            truly.
            But, in with this in mind, I see, in our freedom, or position of strenght, that there are other's behind
            me
            who are not free, and are in fact trying to remove negativity. There are those, perhaps closest to me,
            who
            are not so swell, or wise at least, in their positive approach: but even nearby, 'as if an ember

            albeit resolved, so are you not moving based on deliberation, but rather some oblige. Despite seeming
            like a
            deliberation, ambition is really not so: as one who is not obliged, lives without burden, and by that,
            amends to things via their freedom, rather than for it.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the right way of seeing this is along the lines of progress. For indeed, we resolve
            ourselves to go to school, have families, achieve things. But these things are temporary, 'like one
            reaching
            for the mountain top'. But our life, amidst the constant development of nature and mankind, is
            commiserably
            flowing: and thus, each top is but the beginning of the next. And the resolve to reach a point is not
            the
            same is being resolute in being: for in one, and end is reached, while the other, is never done.
            <br>&emsp;By this token, I can admitt that our efforts are driven by this 'progresive notion'; and that
            we
            do not in fact have an aim. What I've noticed, is that the misfortune of other people becomes apparent
            to me
            when we are not so resolve: as if we are free enoguh to be, but by that, not so comfortably when, in
            such
            openesses, we overlook others in need. But around this then lies resolves of the sort, where we seek to
            aid
            others. Only, this seems like it's own form of being, in that, by which end or not, I will simply try.
            "In
            recycling, deliberation regarding politics, liking videos and all things of the sort, so are we active,
            and
            a such, a person who exhibits such via their constitution. It is not so much that we have an end in
            mind,
            but a resolve of being. That we'd wish for some point to be reached is but a ideal call, as to encourage
            and
            or convince us in the reason and worth of such being."

            How human ought we be? For my own purposes, peace and enjoyment marble my life, with a simple
            accesibility
            and flourishing candour. Not everyone is so austere though; nor, if I gave myself any praise whatsoever,
            mature.
            <br>&emsp;Beyond these positive strides, there still lies the matters which hover above negativity. For
            in
            preservation there may be conflict; or some may not even have a home, or rights.
            <br>&emsp;As such, it is clear, and well executed by individuals, when their against involving others
            are
            not imposing: be it in negligence, belidgerence or vice. But what if another is doing so, ought you
            intervene? Formally, this may merely be a moral question. But practically, what ought we really do? For
            if
            someone is crying in the streets, you help them. No one walking by, if they were not clearly being
            attended,
            would ignore the motion. "They would at the very least cower in shame."
            <br>&emsp;But what if the cries are of someone a country over, a continent even? Such a voice is likely
            but
            a report, or some sort of distributed motion --such as a transmission, or letter. Most have no means to
            aid
            such pleas. But they are also not the one's recieving; but likely those who are civilly arranged to heed
            such matters, and from there respond. "There is much discourse around this though on our local grounds.
            For
            those we elect and convene with, 'as folk of the nation", act in ways regarding foreign affairs that are

            This sentiment could be absolute, in it's nature at least. But I will use it as a prime example an
            approach
            which reflects a subject, and maintains the value of the subject, all the while the approach makes it
            not
            absolute.
            <br>&emsp;That is the notion of semantics; phrases, terminology, form. This is how we establish the
            objects
            of our reasoning, the material of thought. Physcologly and neurology are not so advanced as particle
            physics, but if we overlook the basis for us thinking at all, then we can say distinctly, that semantics
            differs from reality, in that of one, you are merely finding the ingrediants, considering how you'll mix
            them; while reality --as to somewhat include thinking-- holds such mixing and combining, and all
            consquent
            actions born about. Additionally, when it comes to the world in which we derive our concepts, so may we
            mention this as mere reflection; whereby the worlds elements strike us, and by the impression dealt, so
            do
            we regard and define: whereupon we ask, resolve and proceed.
            <br>&emsp;One of the ideas along these lines is the sentiment of taste; whereby our semantics may not
            espouse right and wrong, good and bad, while our natures, as struck and drawn by nature, or reality
            rather,
            bear us to proceed in according ways: the ends of which we approve of, as if by some scale for good, by
            their taste.
            <br>&emsp;I mean to explore this notion of semantics, as describing it as 'some formation of words and
            jargon' is not something which seems entirely fair. But I do see it, usefully at least, as a contrast to
            what is otherwise real, and by that as it pertains to the good, apparent.
            <br>&emsp;For the issue in life is whether our ends be goverened by natural reason, or the esteem of
            semantics. Again, I don't wish to put the latter in a box, 'as if Aristotle and Aquinas were making but
            worded arguments'. But I do see that there is a basis for these sentiments in which the worth of them is
            via
            some sort of necessity. "As if, by pure reasoning, rather than by what we observe, that it can be shown
            how
            things must be a certain way." The key issue then with semantics is their source for terms, as any
            principled notion of being is quite hard to approve when the material in which it molds it's arguments
            come's from something real. And the limit of real things is that they cannot be explained naturally, or
            at
            least by something which we could in theory observe. The idea of neccessity, as if a crutch to the
            inability
            for reality to be such a way, but of a principle sort instead, lies warrantedly upon our faith in
            principle,
            and not natural reason; but also, to any accredited degree, of the form in which neccessity takes, 'as
            pure
            reason is not espused the same by all, and thus holds it's own scale for proper decree', that so much as
            such espousals are deemed fair by virtue of natural reason being unlauded, then so must such principle
            cames
            derive themeselves from material outside what natural reason offers. "For such semantic claims are only
            valid so much as such reason is not: and so the former pulling from the latter insubstantiates itself."
            <br>&emsp;In other words, claims regarding the world faulter on their limited identity. "As the form,
            basis
            and cause for something ought be inherent to it in the way we speak of it; for of that dog over there,
            in
            regarding it I am pointing to it as 'that dog'; but as a thing, as 'that dog', so is it a thing in
            entirety,
            and thus of all the properties within it's identity." The limit of this is the basis for neccessity, or
            principle rather; as something not being in and of itself, but rather imposed upon, 'by a principle
            hwich is
            not, in a fair sense, real', is what the natural limit implores.
            <br>&emsp;But in all of this, we have what I'd esteem as a sort of inquiry. For the lack of true
            identity is
            in all practicality a state of our awareness, and not something which we know is unaccessible. There
            are, to
            be fair, claims regarding principle, that, of their being principle, so is this required innately; and
            not
            souly as an alternate to our natural limits. And by that, even if there is realistically more we could
            identify about something, so is plausible that the floor (so to speak) is truly 'unreal'; and that we
            don't
            merely have faith in this, but know. You could also say the same thing equally about reality, in that it
            must be real, and makes little sense being dual, or not completely immenent (but also imposed). My ears
            are
            open to the inquiries regarding principle and any of their sure claims, but surrounding these semantics,
            or
            ideas rather, there sits a sort of natural clutch; in which the value of a complete reality is
            positivley
            further known; and more, that any plausibility in this not being so, or at least there being somethinbg
            else, is entirely confused; in that, of anything bit and piece used in principle's claim, 'that those
            elements must themselves be ecistent, or imminent rather, or otherwise be in need of their own
            imposition'.
            The cause of God is a common example of this notion. Again, I admitt that their may be angles to this
            which
            don't reduce 'this other world' to it's ostensively real world, 'adjacent to our own, and equally of
            foreign
            need'. But I do say, that of that possible inquiry, that we merely state that it is semantics which best
            explains this line of procession, whereby the potential for principle is there, as we believe or think
            neccessary, but otherwise is squished out of the buldging extent of our espousals of reality, and the
            otherwise weakness in the idea of there being anything else: for which our faith in reality is formed.
            "Pure
            reason reflects the fair espousal of the need of principle; be it in what natural reasoning lakcs, or
            what
            is altogether enhirently warranted by it. Semantics lacks this credible expression, and instead sits in
            orbit outside the lands of natural reason: while pure reason exists as it's own centre. Funnily enough,
            the
            weakest products of such reason are the debirs of suprersition, where the results which such reasoning
            espouse are deemed confirmed by such 'gossiped events'. But that is just a sly remark of mine. Deep
            reason
            may live it's day, as we natural reckoners do: we are all inquirers."

            When I have enough to do, my time is tempered by occupation; and thus I see not but fashions itself
            around
            this. When I am not so obliged, I see around, feeling a little unkept at our emptiness; and by that,
            lack of
            attention to those who are struggling. But while were occupied, I naturally respond with, 'to those, I
            cannot: I have something else to do'. I don't think it an unimportant point that I'd amend myself for
            the
            sake of other's; and for the sufficiency which my current occupations are staked on, so could I earn the
            same through more helpful ways. But in this deliberate address, 'where I holster myself towards the care
            of
            others', I sit on a path which is wholly my own. Only, if such path is burned with fortune and
            indolence,
            then we feel less grounded in it being about me: for it is our center, but nothing to it. While having
            something to do, dissolves any worry or contempt, 'at being so self-centred, yet hollow'; as we are
            either
            a) elsewhere obliged, and unoticed of anything but, or b) relaxed into the notion, that of anything else
            I
            cannot, for of my current stead, I must show up. I may make the choice to go elsewhere, but as much as I
            am
            employed for our own purpose, so is our committment attached to that. "Making it so, of other things, I
            can't."
            <br>&emsp;I don't have grand aims though, in terms of what our own life would seem like. If we
            realistically
            have reason and permission to abide our own time, so am I still uninterested in being so indeluably
            occupied. I still wish for a life with few problems, merely the ebbs of employment. I like to be
            invovled
            with such thing, for the exercise, the itinerary, seeing others, be it strangers or collegues. This is a
            track which is both sufficient and nourishing. As steady as this line is, I am annointed to it through
            time's channel. Upon our work being done, we merely wander, see and alight to the lands and scene
            around:
            only to dip our toes back in the pool of employment. This is our path, our process; and it is only when
            it's
            rythm is flat, as our life has at some points been, that we yearn for something more. As we may still be
            active and great but without amends; and thus drawn, by our free time, to show all how to live so great.
            Ultimatley, these states are generally due to vagrancy, rather than stable flourishing. You may be given
            much, but it is not unbridled, or a real means for happiness. There may be something to it, as our
            generous
            oblige does have free time. But I think overall, there is air beneath this claim, and does not reflect
            what
            is required or effective. I much prefer our line of employment, in it's simplicity, and the cares and
            amends
            which sprout from that. If we are so privalaged, let us not sink into it, but use it as a soft means to
            embellish our employment; and maintain that proper pace, 'in style and grace', but in a way that the
            privalge nicely offers. "Without fortune, we may simply be, but in an arrangment that asks a bit more
            from
            us. While being so free, ought make room for nearer liberty: where we live happily, but rightfully: and
            it
            is our privalge which allows this to happen so calm and lightly."

            Nor is my grip on humanity lacking, as I read memoirs from soldiers, medics, ministers and such;
            equally,
            our philosophy, or character, is as solid, as we read Plutarch, Seneca and Montainge. Nor do I lack my
            own

            have
            our words neared a million."
            <br>&emsp;I say this, for when I hear of the world, be it in passing, or from a strict source, I am
            always
            impressed with a view that accounts for too little; or says as much. That, and of what is said, so are
            the
            strides of it all, close and far, not as it may seem. The way in which you take in such information
            moulds
            what you take in, and thus what you see. But the point, is that, be it hasty predictions and or
            judgement,
            or the mere acceptence of the scene at hand, that so is there more: not only in what is being impressed,
            but
            also what your own thinking would deem. For even the mightiest of claims, full of truth and depth, holds
            no
            meaning for us unless we reflect, determine and amend.

            the
            literary medium, strikes those foreign. This is but influence though, as if some spreading of truth: for
            fire's to no longer be made. As for those at home, so man has strenght and adaptibility. Nor is everyone
            effected like another: in magnitude or actual effects. "Some have something removed, but still hold
            alot,
            while other's experience a relatively higher loss: while some loose much less. And of those who loose
            much,
            so doth our pithy cares and fears melt away, and be it the most grievous despair, or one of economic
            plight,
            so our strength and endurance lay. Pain lies otherwise, as something worth avoiding, but complete in
            itself,
            and experienced accordingly: which is a point most challenging to contend."

            up,
            that we speak of things from such a bound state. "As if our sight was condensed, and thus, of the
            flickering
            images we say, we tried to define. Weirdly though, there is this thing, where in our hazy view, we reach
            for
            clarity even more: which is natural perhaps, as the simple wish to see is common, and so as much as it
            is
            gone, so further effort lay."
            <br>&emsp;I see that education is merely a distribution of past experience. A curriculum is a sort of
            curration of this, as to say, which parts of the domain we divulge, and the elements within those. For
            me,
            like most, I have a unique curriculum. As I have read books, seens shows, reflected here and there in a
            way
            that is original to me: as other's equally experience. And I see us offering such through the time
            ahead.
            <br>&emsp;But I am restless, thrown off by international contention; and this isn't helped by the
            scandalous
            impression we recieve; and, equally, the abscence of reflection and incorporation that the presentation
            of
            such things provides.
            <br>&emsp;Our view of the world has come out of idle defintiion. Looking for more, wishing to feel fine.
            But
            in that, we've grown a tight hold of such things. Yet, there is still not much but this, and so when
            were
            impressed by others, or even with suspense of sharing who we are, we have nothing but our 'literary
            memory'.
            <br>&emsp;Ironically, our care to study comes from our wish to fortify ourselves against the suggestions
            around me. First, we sought to explore the meaning of wellness, as to be positive in our dismissal of
            our
            parents pleas. But during that, as we accordingly lived, we sought to learn of the world; as seeing how
            it
            is reguarly, and in it's breadth is relatively mundane and common, gave me a sort of righteous peace.
            "As if
            time would go on, and by our fair actions, treat us." But this is not to hard to describe as our
            'private
            pace' being secured by worldly sense: as to remove envy, hatred and yearning.
            <br>&emsp;This spot speaks greatly, as we have never lived in a way, that was truly ours, but without
            the
            brace this requires. For we are without friends, romance, comfort or acclaim. Even in our applied
            moments,
            so were these concessions to such lackings, 'as if they were truly needed, and in response, we occupied
            ourselves in a way fitting to me: yet such ways were a mark of you lacking'.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps it's the form of our day, in that were part of an economy, housed in property, and
            thus
            foreign to those next door; nor so familiar or attached to those you see during work --and sometimes at
            best, often. I recall as a kid that we'd see the same people every day at school. But as we've grown
            older,
            there is not but who you see at work. There is much interest, and you may through leisure and what not
            connect. But of actual people, who give weight and support to your mind, there is little.
            <br>&emsp;Ulotimately, I am thrown off by the world around, when it is suggested, and through a form
            which
            does so hotly, but we are not at all present. I don't participate, actively at least, in such forms,
            because
            they are so hard to be present with. But I see, even in our passing, that we'd normally be fine

            So, beneath our moving state, lies someone who is neither content nor secure. I see how shaky we are
            upon
            political discourse; or when someone thinks our views are confusing, or wrong.
            <br>&emsp;We are not so absent though, and perhaps, be it out of fatigue or reason'd argument, we sink
            too
            much into those baser holes: which tends to make us strain on the other uplifting points.
            <br>&emsp;We are simply without problems, nor fun though. And because of this, we feel ourselves
            teatering
            towards poor choices. Yet, we are not so naturally alive in our active state. And so, without occupying
            ourselves eslewhere, or, by virute of that, our lack of general occupation per our broader choices, that
            so
            do we feel that slumping, or at least suggestive plea, whereby we sink into what matters to us, 'yet
            thereby
            remove ourselves from the world'. Were not there, merely with sight: as one does when there in middle
            earth,
            while reaing LOTR.
            <br>&emsp;This is the problem you see; that you cannot pang yourself to lift up above 'your emotions or
            colored responsed'; nor are we accepting of that which would remedy us in our otherwise personal place.
            "For
            this holds no fun, nor the cares from occupation."

            I sit here as one, whose made an oringal choice, to beckon themselves to the simple side of life, in all
            her
            ease and glory. Only there's this shame in doing so, as you feel, in some sense fairly, though also with
            privalage, that other's are in worse affairs then you are. Indeed, in my younger years, I felt cynical
            about
            this, exclaiming that it was there choices which brought them there. And I don't think this false, but
            also
            a bit to self-centered of me, 'as if it is my right, or even a full-fledged claim, to say that there
            struggles are not to do with circumstance, but themselves'. I think these sentiments are important, just
            as
            remarking on our goals and their progress is something good for anyone in any pursuit. But we ought be
            more
            senisible to those who are already in motion.
            <br>&emsp;Where I've sat for some time is in this state, where the impressions I had of the world were
            such,
            that of their quality I cared for dear. Yet the idea that I'd watch something, or bear some idea of
            something, and feel it so important to arrange myself as to see these better, or with a serious mind,
            only
            reflects our peculiar state. In many ways, it come's from this managed state of freedom, whereby all the
            burdens and deeds in the world are removed for the benefit of peace and activity. Yet, we somewhat cower
            to
            this very motion, 'as upon our relaxtion, or pause of such motions, which are in themselves very good,
            we
            don't anticipate returning, nor being stout to their means'.
            <br>&emsp;In effect, we've helmed the form of our ideas, as for some reason, this gave reason and
            purpose to
            such line. But the result is an all to wearying affair. For no one really cares, nor am I that worthy in
            our
            espousals. The world is not some cohesive bunch, 'but like the summer, everyone is dealing with the
            heat'.
            <br>&emsp;I find that much of our confidence come's from our approach; that it was fair, sensible and
            rewarding. And indeed, this ought bring acclaim and afford an impact; yet, in this light we have, we
            don't
            bring it; but rather wish to shine, so other's may see and heed us. This is an odd notion, for our inner
            self wishes to contribute, or at least have our wisdom heard. Yet we don't wish to speak.
            <br>&emsp;I think that, had we been with different strides, then we wouldn't feel so endebted to this
            complex approach; and by that, so defensive of anything which bore suggestions from some point else. I
            think
            the root of these need is by our momentum, and how despite relishing our joy and motion, that so don't
            we
            care for this in any great or meaningfull way. For is it really that special? Ought we be heralded? And
            of
            the moral which this story of our's has forbode, is it a way that is exclsuive? For if it is, then your
            begrudgement is understandible, or at least clear in the sacrifice: for I may give up friends for joy.
            But
            is such a request in place? We've learned not. Only, of our motions, born towards said friends, or by
            our
            joyous stride, so are we unsure how to do so. And it is not an unimportant point that our choices thus
            far,
            as born from the varied states of those joyous (yet as such reserved) motions, is one, where of those
            friends, we are in company not; nor, of things meaningfull, are we with much constance of place, to feel
            like we can broadly proceed. "For we too often see an end in sight; and thus collect ourselves as to
            approach it peacefully: while our ambition is dead."
            <br>&emsp;For so long, we've been learning of the world as to justify, or be able, in being skeptical.
            That
            no matter the results, so were they not as you beleived; and thus could be handled. "The world always
            sheds
            her flame." Again, we brace ourselves, or at least affirm the breadth of the world, and how any cause
            for
            concern, criticism or bleak view is ill founded: in that it applies to smaller view. But this push of
            ours
            comes from us being somewhat endowed to the world beyond me. "As if to justify our reserved state, yet
            supposed blossoming: that things will be fine till we reach that." It seems clear now, that we ought
            sink
            back into ourselves, and view the world, by fear and oppertunity, or interest at least, as it pertains
            to
            me, and not be so far removed, yet strictly in the grasp of all people and such.
            <br>&emsp;In many ways, our pleas, or inquiries rather, come because of something we don't know. And for
            whichever reason, we hate predictions that come at other people's expense: so I wish to doubt these. But
            it
            is because of things i don't know that I cannot rest so easily, and let things happen. "Perhaps were too
            tucked away in the corner, that we feel, in our un-solid fears, that if something bad was to come to
            pass,
            that we'd be fine. But akin to the economy, so would most be out there in the firestorm: and so, I
            beckon to
            my sense, and at the very least, heed the response of my conclusion as being false, so much as
            somethhing
            seemingly required for the result of it to seem meaningfull, 'in that I knew the domain predicted to be
            effected', that so was any view of such domain, in lacking certain things, false, and thus any fear
            evoked
            was ungrouned. Nor, did what we think, in the broad scale of things, feel so gloomy. Yet, we only
            imagined,
            had the domain been with the properties which I suspected, then the sense of the impact (of some
            esteemed
            cause), be of different scales and propoertion as I otherwise was provoked, or in reaction."
            <br>&emsp;I think, that there are many things to do, or learn rather. And these may be for the reasons
            that,
            of our views, ought they not be full of harsh sympathy. Indeed we may actually care for those impacted,
            whilst retaining some structure at broader scales. But we may also not actually care so much for what
            goes
            on.
            <br>&emsp;I do not wish to dwell, but this sense, where things are not so bad as they seem, is one
            where, of
            a thing's impact, ought it not speak for the rest. And so, if we may accept that all are recieving
            economic
            weight, that to presume anything else is folly. "For I hate thinking that everyone is in plight." And I
            know, or am at least somewhat even-headed, when it comes to the actual dire effects upon people. For
            whatever reason, we see, that this idea that there is more struggle than I really belive, at least in
            proportion, 'as an event in one town does not indicate or speak for the next'. The reality, is there may
            be
            somethimg, even across broad lines. But because our sense is not to ignore, we feel like our weight in
            doing
            so, 'while not overstating things' is to hollow. "We are pointed towards sensibility, but without any
            postive force: we merely have the privalge and broad sense, to reserve ourselves from judgement. Yet, as
            we
            know less about certain things, so can we reserve no longer, and must try to do something, or bear down,
            and
            resist the view which says there bad in all."
            <br>&emsp;Ought we care? Well no, there is no need. But you may care, and apply yourselfs: as if it were
            something your drawn and pleased to do. I am not sure even, for we are ultimately in our own personal
            place.
            Most who deem the world such, fairly or not, forget this: including I. I think, perhaps, if we learned
            more
            about the world, 'as not to merely have the sense, had we learned, that we would be right', that we
            might
            actually be more lauded, and by that, care less to affirm were right. For seeing the whole world, you
            can
            appreciate the economic turmoil of our time, and even cultural discontent; all the while, seeing how
            many
            are effected by malaria and aids, your affirming the bad which you might otherwise ignore. Indeed, these
            things are not absent from our side of the world: but at least were recognizing, outside our issues with
            employment and linving, 'the friction of our fortunes', that so may we actually rest easy on the more
            petulent bad.

            Our relationship to things is two fold. One, is that we may know little of what's going on, but rest on
            our
            memory of the past; that, of whatever does come, so will it effect that which has been; and thus, our
            view
            of such impact may be reigned in, based on what it does or does not change. "For in many ways, walking
            down
            the street, engaging in leisure at home, nothing could cause you to notice this change."
            <br>&emsp;On the other hand is judgement; or at least the exclaiming of things based on what you know.
            This
            is weird, for even in the simplest matters we don't know. "As we are not so embalmed with current
            events."
            But in this, we have tended to rest on a wide structure of the world, 'whereby, less we were
            deliberatley
            with care of all, that of the whole, nothing caused a change'. And we were thrown off when people
            thought
            otherwise. And, as we've overlooked certain things, we are still without that full judgement,'whereby we
            can
            attest to something small, as we have some firmness to the whole'. What occured, is that our broad view,
            'as
            if a permitt to be indifferent', acted as a sort of judgement itself. "Whereby we were against anything
            be
            deemed to happen at all." As a result, we tried to further dilute our worldy sense, 'as to be so far off
            from anything which did happen, that it's impact could not be heard: as if some loud boom a mile away
            was
            pushed 100 further."
            <br>&emsp;And I can't quite say what this means. As I ultiamtely don't wish for their to be any booms;
            but
            my reservation is on the whole, 'as if there are not so many'. But this is about me not needing such
            booms
            to be there. "As if, the world were in fact so spread afar, that the appearence of things, 'outside our
            foreign gaze' was small, and thus it seemed like little was happening. There certaintly is, but via our
            occupation, 'there was little to spurr me', and thus, by our own strides, we could focus on and
            proceed."
            <br>&emsp;The point though, is that even if all the booms in the world feel outside your door, that you
            are
            not so responsible to be so withdrawn in your judgement. I understand the nature of these impressions
            and
            how much they overload you, 'but there being things going on around the world', does not mean that you
            should be impacted, 'as if by our people experiencing trouble'. Our normal response is one where we feel
            little going on. We care for this, because it calls for little judgement; as we need no forwardness if
            their
            is nothing pressed upon us.

            I forget that people are running their own buisness. A house is literally an equity. If you let it go to
            ruin, it looses value, and as such is a worse asset. Very little in the world causes such ware; but,
            many
            things can alter your means of managing this. As you may loose your job, or interest rates go up.
            <br>&emsp;Wisdom is an odd choice, for it tends to speak of sacred things as if they were novel objects,
            'and judged as equal as the rest, by their particualar properties'. And as one who is prior to many of
            these
            things, I may consider them. It also though, suggests things which are clearly 'less sacred' as being
            poor:
            the indulgences if you will. And there is some friction, or mismatching if you will, about caring about
            avoiding such indulgences, while your efforts are towards those sacred things. For you can eat poorly
            and
            raise a child; but you can't enjoy the outdoors as much.
            <br>&emsp;My cares then tend to be in sympathy. As having no problems ourselves, makes it so we see
            other's
            in trouble. By our studies, we are balanced by the broader motions of the world, 'and how in any given
            circumstance they mostly remain'. But I also see, in admitting that, of whichever parts are weighing,
            that
            people feel this weight. And I then mean only to think of them, on their own, with their family and
            friends,
            employed as they are, considering this, making adjusmtnets and such. I make similar efforts regarding
            war,
            that if someone were to be hurt, in wet by rain, then I'd at least remark how this came to be, 'and not
            to
            have unleveled views surrounding this, thematically'.
            <br>&emsp;But the truth in all of this, is that we, personally, are not so invovled : perhaps wisely,
            but
            also without much stability. "Indeed, by the nature of our choices, and the need to be so austere, and
            the
            consquent lack of updraft, or pull rather from ahead, if we fail in such austerity and or lack any
            outside
            things." We are in serious debt of the latter, and thus, our ways can be a bit wearisome. And in this,
            we
            tend to feel the weight of things going around. We try and avoid 'clumped sources', along with having
            some
            understanding, in both the worlds effects and people effected. But our need for this come's from me. As
            I do
            not relish anyone subject to crime or illness, nor economic strife or depravity. "I don't even ignore
            the
            thinning of middle class fortune." But I can see, that this is far beyond me: as my nearest neighbours
            buisness seems to be. And I can see myself caring from our own removed state; but only to be caught by
            the
            pleasures and promise of such 'adventure'. I think, if we were occupied and invovled, as is right and
            natural ---had we been more open despite our integrity-- then we'd more simply notice. And perhaps, by
            that,
            'for in all moments of ease and strenght, we see the world around; and are then pleased or discomofrted
            by
            what see: be it the lands or pestulence', then so, if this great yet stable sight was from higher above,
            'then in our removed solidute', then perhaps our amends would be themselves stronger, and able, in
            effect,
            and happily by our confidence, to proceed

            So there's two thoughts on my mind.
            <br>&emsp;First, is that I see so much promise and ease from fashioning our thoughts as to be guilded by
            inquiry. If we were to be asked, or we were to think, may we flourish by the speculative model. For
            instance, 'is there a God?', is something which holds various elements which give weight to different
            truths. And in your responses, suggestions or inquiries, you may consider such things, or at least speak
            to
            other ideas with these in mind. This is a candid view of this, and perhaps seeps the life from what I
            think.
            I just feel like being able to describe what something is, and in regards to say our mind and vision,
            learning and understanding what is important to that question, makes so you are able and free to ask,
            and
            also respond to other's by asking what they think, or at least affirming where you lean, or ulitmatley
            side
            with, for such reaons. "For we never know, but at least are concluding on some basis." And my interest
            then,
            is to be able to speak to things, be it in descriptions 'regarding what's known', or what is important
            to
            consider, 'regarding the mystery of the past or the future'.
            <br>&emsp;The second point regards a mixture of delight and motion. If the world were black and white,
            and
            only upon certain actions did it have color, how much would any of the concenssions required to make
            such
            actions be worth? "As I've learned, there are concessions not required, yet we act as so; and it seems
            this
            is from us over bearing on the color. But in all honesty, it is more akin to bringing light on the page:
            even though all the colors are equally vivid. Those other things 'of a non colored sort' seem to be what
            brings color, 'in those more primal and or excitable motions'. Trying to be so great that our light is
            found
            elsewhere, 'perhaps in line with those named actions', wares us down."
            <br>&emsp;Regarding motion, I see, how unless something is enticing or you can easily create motion,
            that
            you will not feel brought forth. This is why we like to share things, as it is easier to bring forward.
            Ideas even, or fears, upon their excitement, we may wish to bring clarity to them, and so find somewhere
            that draws them out so they become more defined. I see how those marks, 'as mentioned some time ago',
            are
            relevant hear. As I seek a friend to share and convene regarding the sun, in all her beatuy: but only
            so, by
            the strict relation I have with her, 'I cannot so her full'. And I have found that reflection and
            identity
            go hand in hand in making it easier for me to achieve such a gain. I am not sure of some princiuple
            weakness
            in folk who hold less oblige, and find there delights by being around things which exicte and or foster
            such
            motion. "Rather, than via our finer clarity, by me." But, as someone who is, in all honesty, stout
            enough to
            be so, so in such state, whereby we settle ourselves not on those things which are exciting, 'and of
            delights of their own', that so, by our finer interests in things seperate, are we indetbed to achieve
            things fully, 'so that we are then at peace among those around'. For need of them is smaller than the
            need i
            have in myself, and this can make it harder to coalesque. But, in are smaller ways, if we are fully
            shining
            through, then so can we still be with them. "For we like them, like the sun. But their excitable nature
            requires more. Having enough for this is something I generally resist, as the form of it is overbearing,
            comapred to what I really need, and so I offer none. But, in our quality, of charm and peace, so may be
            offer compartively little, in such form (as we may describe as committment), due to the pungence of our
            prescence: a dense spot of color and joy." Our care for things around, 'as if were taken away by things
            of
            grandeur', is bound in reflection, as are our means to this: for the sight of these things, as to
            compell me
            to ordain myself towards them, 'in the simple, yet personal ways', is also bound in such reflection.
            "Where
            I've come from to be said way."

            Theres a sort of dissonance regarding things around us, as our own motions create. If we are still, but
            at
            rest, then things come upon us, and we incorporate it; and if there is any trouble, so can we handle it,
            'without our entirerty being bent upon it'. And conversely, if we are not at such ease, then so our
            response
            lay.
            <br>&emsp;As it were, being in motion create's the sort of ampleness that allows things to come in and
            leave
            easily. While being still has a sort of precarity to it, for it is naturaly less substantial; and thus
            prone
            to weaker qualities. "While one may be relatively poor, but in a moving state, bear less consquence."
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that we have things to do, duties, deeds, interests and care. And our remarks
            here
            are akin to our muscles feeling flat, or our sleep seeming to struggle do to blood pressure. Our mind,
            or
            tranquility, is it's own state of things, which I am suggesting is effected by the nature of our
            motions.
            For which I may speak of, or just let the basis sit right here.
            <br>&emsp;The basic pivoty of which were on, is one where our life is bade towards creativity, and not
            occupation. For in one, you are progressing, trying for more: working for something far off. While our
            actual steps are such as to be in the present good. Or at least for things which compell me, and ask
            that I
            merely spend my time. There is simply something I wish to do. I'd like to sort our knoweldge into the
            form's
            of inquiry, as to better remark, converse or respond to the nature of life, matter, death, war and
            beauty.
            I'd like to delve into our past, as to draw more inspiration, or insight, as to why I am so creatively
            inclined, and perhaps too overt to other people. "As I see it, being near people is about spending time,
            while I merely wish to bathe in granduer, and by that, apply our efforts to ourselves; as such is the
            lens.
            But of this balance, and all the nerves and tension which come from this, is something, beyond the
            dynamics
            of this, which can be shown in the roots particular to us, and thus how these effects were produced in
            me."
            I love film also, and wish to better know it; as I equally wish for our grand delights. "To better
            define,
            and thus better see."
            <br>&emsp;For whichever reason, we came into our youth, whereupon the deeds of the world were laid
            infront,
            'and we were asked to prepare'; and that upon our mild attempt to do so, we entered the world rather
            alone
            and timid. But we re-routed ourselves towards that which actually supported our creative interests;
            rather
            than that which cultivated a career. The issue in this has never been real contempt by others, but our
            inability to share that we had cares otherwise. We were not judged; but we could not say that we were
            feeling poor or off because we were lacking what our 'creative interests' required. I still find this a
            struggle. But what I've learned, is that this sort of knowledge requires but a mere attendance, as to
            learn
            from your mistakes; but aslo therein, a committment, for you to feel good in doing so. We've just never
            connected, because we held so much emphasis on our flourishing state, that we either aversed ourselves
            from
            other people, or simply could not be present. From this, we were never attached enough to stay put, and
            thus
            moved often. I've noticed over the recent years that I can be more present, being unafraid at least, or
            hidden rather; and by that, able to converse about the common elements of our day and lives. This is
            proficient for peers and friends. But not till much more recent, have I been able to actually share what
            I
            like. Namely, this is in games or tv, youtube even; and although I feel unclear on what I'd say, I am
            getting better, or clear at least, on how to share which music we like. And this has created a more
            positive
            experience with people; where I don't feel removed from them, and thus fufilled, but all while were
            still
            being ourselves. The natural seperation of our lives leaves us as such. But even those who naturally go
            their seperate ways may still connect while their there, so in doing this am I less depressed upon
            failing
            to do so, and then going home. And indeed, being more present allows me to be closer with people,
            despite
            the time I spend with them. And through our life, which has some sort of of pressure on me when it's
            lacking, so when this is alright am I able to be as though we spend alot of time together. With Amon, I
            like
            her, because she's beautiful. But despite this being all I feel, so is our prescence in doing so,
            wherein
            acting upon that like, where I try and talk to her, so am I actually present in a way as if I cared for
            something even more. I understand that such romantic interests may only come about through according
            kinds
            of actions, but so may we at least share a pulse, or have some emotional repor. I feel like I could ask
            where she's from, and so forth. My heart merely sees her, and wishes to interact; and when our fear us
            unbearing, nor our loined interests causing treipdiation (as if theres this huge stake), then we may
            fully
            be, as were pleased to. "I'm just afraind to live without our armour. For we may fail, and by that be
            withdrawn. But something always sticks with you, and I feel like where we are indubitably, is one where
            we
            need not fetter. Just love the outdoors, nurture your inquiry, enjoy Youtube and Games. And you need not
            save the world: you've got no anwser. Where we go in life may be in producing something postive, or
            removing
            negative. It may be in big positions or small ones. Let's be a man though; and in our boldness, work
            from
            nothing but the simplicity of that."

            So there is the possibility that Amon likes you. Seeing as I like her, maybe we could hang out, go on a
            date, make love. But to what end? Well, I see how many of these things come together than spread apart.
            I
            don't wish to be her boyfriend, as I don't like her in that way. I just think she's beautiful, and I am
            interested in her as such. I little crush if you will.
            <br>&emsp;My fear is that we cannot like her if we don't mean to go all in. But this is not true. If we
            like
            eachother, let us go out, hang out, chat, be intimate. Like were dating. And if it comes to an end, let
            it
            be so naturally. But this can happen. Your free to like her, for you need not avoid it happening. "As if
            you'd be entering some agreement which you intend not on filling." I'd just like to date. Simple. Nor am
            I

            So I see that were a bit hesitant, or at least with a beat that is unsprung, or reserved. This is so,
            for I
            do not know what I see, simply.
            <br>&emsp;In some sense, this is so, for of the things which may make me move, or seem to in deep ways,
            that
            so do these require so much. Only, of the requirments, I have tended not to respect them, and thus their
            ardent use for an otherwise good end.
            <br>&emsp;But this is confused. I understand the idea of love, 'in all her offer and glory' is something
            sweet and plenty, but is it really something you want? I recall moments where I have, but it was only
            when I
            thought the person I liked was going away. "For I in truth, just wanted ot be me, knowing they were
            there."
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, ought you be present as to procure a sort of committment that is of quality,

            So I thought I'd reflect on this past game, as it pertains to our future military one.
            <br>&emsp;To begin, we must remember, that be it +10 settlement limit or 4 at end of antiquity, you
            still
            start the age with 8, then 16 in modern. Happiness is not generally an issue, though, with Rome for
            instance, you do want enough policy slots to fit in (the potentially irrelevant) traditions, along with
            things to boost your economy. So you don't want to go to much over your limit, but 1 is generally
            acceptable
            ---as you can get villages that give you good amounts of happiness.
            <br>&emsp;Regarding city states, their so important, despite being expensive. I am not sure if getting
            your
            first suzerain triggers a diplo point, despite it happening before. I think obvious momento is military,
            and
            Gate of Nations on top of that. But taking a diplo one with the hope of getting Emille Belle, or a diplo
            point is gamble. At any rate, city states scale by how many you have of any sort. Regarding combat, you
            can
            get +1 on your infantry for each city state. This makes a military state crucial for our early game,
            then
            adding more throughout the age. Equally important, is that you must protect the state, as your enemies
            will
            attack it ---either during a war with you, or as a specific target.
            <br>&emsp;The first choice of your game is which golden age you want. You benefit somewhat from getting
            complete points for each, but only one can use the tier 3. Science and Culutre each carry over their
            respective tier two buildings, while Economics keeps your cities from this age. I believe military just
            gives units per city, which feels irrelevant compared to more yields. And, in our conquest aim, were
            less
            likely to convert to cities, as we don't need so much infastrucutre, but military. So economic seems
            less a
            priority, as were less likely to convert all our cities and build them up. It depends on the gold
            though, as
            having a few cities which you put in some academies or amphitheatres may not be so beneficial.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, taking influence early on is important, though, science is much more important
            for
            conquest, as it get's you to bronze working, the wheel, the tier 3 techs, plus masteries. Taking the
            science
            skill that boosts mastery progression is a benefit.
            <br>&emsp;In exploration, you have two strips of islands which get filled up by all sides. In modern,
            our
            goal is to capture a chunk of settlements that are not folowing our ideology; which means we must have
            one,
            and them. At a baseline, you can terroize the seas, capturing all the coastal settlements, likely
            getting a
            bunch of treasure fleets --for economic boosts in the modern age. One possibility is in the culture
            golden
            age, which retrains your religios effects. I think the thing I'm unclear about, is the extent to which I
            can
            conquer, as I only have so much settlement limit. Second, is how were supposed to develop our economy,
            when
            were so focused on military. I suspect theirs a balance, where you get tons of cities; and this doesn't
            take
            the world, but select attacks backed up by generals and proper units. This increases your economy
            overall,
            and, in particlar, if your taking cities, then their's infastrucutre already there.

            How would you describe the world, in order to root your inquiry?
            <br>&emsp;Well, you ought know the proportions of it. That form of breadth and depth, so doth the
            present
            and history lay. The actual lands are not so much an issue, but where people lie; and at that, how many.
            It
            is not likely that you can name every town, nor count the amount people in each; but you can say how
            many
            their are. Population is an odd thing, as it is more of a qualifier, in terms of how many towns of X
            population their are; rather than something which described any particular town. You may look at the
            world,
            and see, again, how many towns have more than a million folk. You may also speak to the towns of an
            extremely large sort, like Tokyo, Lagos or Bangok. In fact, of these, those which are remarkable become
            a
            world of their own, and thus warrant their own disseminated view ---in they way their divided, and the
            motions of those inside.
            <br>&emsp;Past values are important to, ie. the people of Athens or Rome, of old Britan, France or
            China, to
            modern.
            <br>&emsp;Surrounding this are the motions of the world, or objects rather. How much coal is consumed,
            and
            otherwise extracted. How much fresh water is in use; how many comparatively have some than those prior.
            The
            amount of food produced, the amount of waste. Emission levels and associated metrics. How many people
            travel, tour, immigrate, die, are killed, crash, are impoverished, are black, old, disabled.
            <br>&emsp;Grip these facts: it is better know some absolutely, then be wishy washy about all. "We are
            only
            what we can speak of; for we can only listen, and until practiced, pretend: and we don't even do these
            as
            good as we could if we have not formed something to begin."
            <br>&emsp;Another thing is in our inidivual motions. For we each breathe, eat and sleep; but also drink
            coffee, smoke, poop and pee, look at our phones and watch tv, recycle or not, use water, be it cold or
            hot.
            We earn average amounts of income, spend average amounts of taxes, or on expenses. We have rights,
            restrictions, addendums and deeds. "But these are perhaps less about us, than the complex which manages
            us:
            and the center for politics, regarding those managing such complex." Of those, you have servants,
            officials,
            higher ups; and these are split from branches to departments, as secretaries or assistants.
            <br>&emsp;There are events, from the Trojan War, to that from Persia or in the Pelopanesse; to
            Alexanders
            assault, the Punic, to Greece's conqueing by Rome, to Caeser's civil war. To the barbarian conflicts,
            through Byzantine, Lombards and the Franks. To the century of England and France, to 1550 France and
            1600
            Germany. To the disputes of Sweden, Russia, Netherlands and Spain, to 1812, Mexico, Bohr and
            Franco-Prussia.
            Then Korea, Nam, Gulf Wars and Iraq. Along with those in Africa, or other odd ends; be it Rwanda or
            Yugoslavia.

            I'm nervous about Amon. She's got me riled up. Because she's beautfiul, and I want to see her naked, to
            kiss
            her, lick her pussy, fuck her hard. I want her to grab my dick, such it and ride me. Oh my.
            <br>&emsp;But the reality is, that I need only show my interest, by saying hellow, how are you, talking
            about the job. "Just the other day, I said that she did not have to scan the door, as it was now
            automatic."
            Further, ask her about herself, where she came from, who she is; and by that, maybe she'll ask you.
            <br>&emsp;I feel this interest is leaned too forward onto those haughty pleasures. And so, by virute of
            being at work, and not seeing her too much, makes it so the effort I can put in, feels ineffective; and
            thus
            I feel pushed to do more; yet, I cannot do so much, out of sense, and thus I wish to call the whole
            thing. I
            don't want regrets, but I am struggling to handle just doing what's right.
            <br>&emsp;I don't believe she is young, or too young at least, as I've seen her there often: and she
            would
            be in school otherwise. But she may have a boyfriend, or be simply uninterested. She may live near
            Surrey,
            'as I heard her remark that she found something near Guildford'. But she also may not want to engage
            with
            someone at work. Even if I make her heart flutter, or make her nervous, she may not want to go through
            with
            anything. "I'm thinking of Kelly back at Save-On." This is why learning about her and telling her about
            you
            make's you more commensurable; and is not some heartfelt fling: which is hard for anyone to act on. "And
            may
            mean less to the other person. I'm thinking of Holly, who did not care for me in the same way I did for
            her."
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps, the anwser is to be unafraid, and not linger on the thought, expecting something. Do
            as
            you please, in that you would ask her about her background; for your interest is compelled to do so.
            That is
            what I'd like to know: it's as if I am entering her further. This is natural. But you can do this
            without
            much planning, nor need of much. This is how you ought live generally, in that you may ask people things
            and
            be asked about yourself. This is how you inquire and respone truly and freely; and not, as it once was,
            with
            trepadtation or fabrication; where you were nervous to be upfront and honest, or were forming something
            else
            you'd prefer to say. Josh for instance, ask him where he's from, what he plans to do. Ask Sam if she
            likes
            Nintendo. Ask people about their families, their background, their life. Amon, because she is pretty,
            and
            for no reason else, is someone I would like to get closer to; so when you can ask her. "As if it were a
            little dance."

            Regarding data and information, there are official sources, whose reliability is high via the
            instituional
            and or civil nature. References include Britannica and factbooks, while Wikiepedia is User Currated; but
            is
            thus not a primary source, but can be verified. "As a platform, it aims to highlight where information
            given
            is noted as being drawn from some source --as listed in references below-- or that its lacking." News
            Articles are similar, as yuo trust that the information is properly sourced. Though, the issue is in the
            editorialized and rheotic nature; meaning, that althoguh there are facts, there may also be conjecture
            and
            or opinions: these are fine, but ought be distingusihed between facts. General websites are no different
            in
            principle, but are not held to so high an authority, 'that the facts are properly sourced', and so more
            discretion is advised; as some sites may not show their sources, or may have done so improperly. The
            news is
            a reputable source for properly sharing information from officual outlets; but they are not officual
            sources
            themselves, merely organized currations. "Wikipedia is equal, but without uniform collaboration; as any
            person can contribute; while a news source is an organization, and prided on their reliability in
            quality
            sourcing." Acadmic sources are by nature dense, but so much as their peer reviewd, they may be
            themselves
            offical, or primary rather.
            <br>&emsp;It is also worth noting aggregators, which act as currators of the pure data given by primary
            sources --statistica, worldomotets. These can be a bit misleading at times, but only if you are not
            aware of
            the dataset in which their figures are drawn from.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, information is found and given, and those who do so are deemed primary and
            offical. "The governmetns and researchers of the world." While delivery of this may be done first hand,
            or
            thorugh curration; be it Wikipedia, Vogue, or a blog.
            <br>&emsp;On that note, the U.N is one of thee main officual services. They account for 195 countries in
            the
            world, two (Palestine and Vatican) being somewhat partial. There are 6 habitable continents: North
            America,
            South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Europe and Asia may be considered Eurasia. There are 54
            countires in
            Africa, 49 in Asia, 44 in Europe, 14 in Oceania, 33 in Latin/South America, and Canada plus U.S.A in
            North
            America. South American has 12 countries, 8 in central (if you include Mexico), and 14 in carribean.
            Known
            as Latin America, there's 33 in total, 22 in what's known as central america.
            <br>&emsp;So a country is composed of primary and secondary divisions, ie. provinces and states, and
            counties and or districts within those.
            <br>&emsp;Within Asia, there are 3000 primary divisions, 1500 in Europe, 1000 in South America, 200 in
            Oceania, 63 in Canada+US, and over 1000 in Africa. Thats about 6500 provinces, regions and states.

            So, municipalties are the actual pieces of the world, as it is where people actually live. These are
            grouped
            into districts/counties, which are then grouped into provinces/regions/states, and those into a country.
            <br>&emsp;Canada has approx. 3600 towns ---which we'll define as municipalities and cities too. "this is
            from 2021 population census. Canada"
            <br>&emsp;The U.S has 16,400 incorporated --legally defined place, under law-- places above 1000.

            And I
            will note, that this definition of municipality begins at 1000 people, as this to me remarks a defined
            community, and thus complex/system/ array of human action, and is thus worth our regard. A farmstead for
            instance is more of a family and less of a network of interaction, and something to be judged outside

            with
            45m. In total, as of 2023, the world has 8.045 billion people. This amounts to about .9
            growth per year, or 200,000 people a day ---73 million per year.
            <br>&emsp;Historically, in during the neolithic era, into agriculture, there were some short amount of
            millions of
            people. It's estimated there were about 15 million as the roots of civilizations began -- 5000 BC. This
            value kept
            increasing in multiples ever millenia, from 45m in 3000bc to some range of 50-100m in 1000Bc. At the
            birth of christ,
            there were some few hundred million people; the Romans accounting for upwards of 70 million of this.
            Through the
            medieval age, the levels remained in the couple 100 million, being cut severely by the black plague; the
            population did
            not recover till the 16th century. By 1800 the population had reached a billion, and 1.6 by 1900. 2 bill
            was hit by 1927
            --taking 127 years from 1800--- then another 33 to hit 3 billion (1960). 14 years to 4 (74), and again
            to 5 (87), and
            consecutivley, it's been 12 years per bill, from 1999, 2011, 2023. It took the world all of ancient time
            to reach a
            hundred million, and from there, it took some two to three thousand years to reach a billion. It took
            only 127 years to
            reach another billion, then some shrinking number of decades to reach subsquent billions. From 1927 till
            now, we've
            added near 6 billion: in 100 years! Also, life expectancy rose from an average 31 in 1900, to 73. And

            I admitt that our doubts come from trepidation; in that, less we can say what we mean, clear and
            positively,
            then those who deem themselves right will denounce me.
            <br>&emsp;But, no matter, I find much advantage in seeing our affairs, or comments rather, along the
            lines
            of value and resolve.
            <br>&emsp;For in one, you have the basis of your life, the bed, the food, humanity. And then you have

            in

            <br>&emsp;Similarly, I've found great respite in the simple conventions of the world. Being polite and
            inalterable infront of policemen or those at some formal desk. To friends, I learn about them, and
            provide
            them the same. And to all things correspondance, I try and speak simple. The words I've chosen have not
            always worked, nor have my choices brought me to any real success: but I at least know that life is not
            some
            game. "And the worse part of our aging account, is how we overted ourselves away, as if it were, and we
            did
            not wish to participate." More and more can I just show up, but while being me, open, free and happy.
            "Romance, friendship, oppertunity and or lick, are more surely coming; or at least, in possibility,
            bound to
            stay."
            <br>&emsp;I sympathize with those who are not so willfully peacefull; or are burdened by their choices:
            how
            the road is rough for them at least. But I do say, with humble certainty, that by my civil accounts,
            national security is all too common, as are our state affairs more indeluable than that. Nor, in my
            submission, 'which others may not realize that this is all they'd be asked to do', is no fault by me;
            for we
            already live simply; and nothing which I care for or am enlivened against, is brought by any venture or
            plea, which potential restrictions may apply. It is possible that we are locked in our homes, or
            sentenced
            to death. These are grave and unfathomable, but still, able to be adjusted to if they come to be. "And
            you
            can always lower your hand, and offer your throat. For by a corporal blade or time's demand, so am I set
            for
            deep tranquility."

            I live in a dream, some sort of scene built by imagery. Yet I feel this wrong, 'as it's completey
            centered
            around ne', as a kid often experiencs.
            <br>&emsp;Yet, when I sit back, and gaze at the real world, I see how ignorant I am, how little I know;
            how
            virtually in all areas, I can speak so little of.
            <br>&emsp;This is not damnation upon, but a symptom of our lack of aim. For in my studies I can see, how
            wide and dipsered man's actions are; and how, even in our most engaged and reactive sight, 'that so much
            of
            which is common and of the norm, good or not, slides past our sight'. As such, our aim would be
            welcomed,
            'for I would not fret if our care was for that, and not for any perceived misfortunes of others'. For
            that
            would be the mark of a dream: and our care for a goal within reality is not contrasted to an otherwise
            illusory view: in which people may seem to be settled in.
            <br>&emsp;It would be one thing, if we leaved in paradise, but still lacked an aim; whereby we were free
            to
            reach for anything, but were otherwise given nothing. In this muddling state, we see somewhat that
            other's
            are in trouble around. Or better said, we feel morally shamed, and pridefully stricken at being so
            unclear
            and ambivolent. I recognize that this may come from the nature of our values, in that they are of
            ourselves.
            Yet, by virtue of our harmony with them, and the recent relinquish of any honor and or fielty to them,
            'as
            if doing them was some sort of value in itself, rather than the effect they bade', that so are we merely
            growing, and further trying to acquiese. In many ways, this remarks the care for our experience, and
            nothing
            which comes from an abandoment of this loose threads. For when they are tight we are content; but by the
            way
            of nature, still subject to things, but thereby with a calm yet mighty response: for which we gain.
            <br>&emsp;It seems clear that our personal interests were not benefited by our conclusion to hollow
            away,
            all private, and at best in solitude. Not only was this not a benefit to the actions themselves, but it
            also
            removed us from other pleasing actions: one's which were in truth concordent with these personal ones.
            <br>&emsp;In a similar sense to our doubt's upon thinking of an aim, 'as we feel so lost prior', so in
            the
            cares of our actions, does passion sit upon our groundless self, whereby the threads below, if left
            unattended, make for top heavy interests, 'rather than those on sturdy grounds'. From such grounds our
            cares
            naturally blossom.
            <br>&emsp;I don't mean to be ideal though. For broad strokes may be given, officially or in curration.
            And
            as such, I see how our own impression may be strengthed as not to feel afraind or sympathetic in an
            illusory
            way. My ignorance remains as to our personal action's, and that of other's personally, but that is all
            we
            can really make for. Else, we are but straddled by a weary state upon our inner choices, or beckoned and
            emabalmed to the silky view ahead. "For we never wish to stay still, and thus ordain to ourselves, or
            dream
            ahead."
            <br>&emsp;What I wish to remark then, is how, in our less than grinding efforts, ought we be ahead. For
            I
            see, perhaps, that a true state of grace bears no imposition on us, and we are thus pleased and plump to
            proceed. By media, slack choices, and the wear of work, are we at the very least tilted, and by that, in
            a
            less than contented state. I naturally settle back, but thereby feel in less motion. "For we never bade
            to
            that which promised us something outside our inner self. Nor, in our choice for the latter, have we
            began to
            move from our harmony with that. And so, having returned to strenght I ask."
            <br>&emsp;There's just enough in our life, that this still remarks may be but soft comments on our
            drifting
            gait; a pace of which will increase. We have our health and minor home affairs, our small workload and
            it's
            social compartement. The sun comes and goes, and offers not always her brightest show. So our health is
            beckoned to, in being able enough to let us be both drawn and amended. "And so, in our respite of this,
            may
            we study the land, in both history and dynamics, as to see the tendancy of when she come's, and of what
            manner." For we may not fear to forget, and, in line with our baser harmonies, 'the rythm of which
            extends
            on, as if a melody according to my life,' may we feel naturally treated by the motion of such path, 'and
            what is simply expected to come'.

            In some odd sense, I contend that our hygiene is what distinguishes us all. And as, for the most part,
            we
            don't berate and or snide regarding someone's culture or race, so do we not remark upon their smell. We
            do
            these things for appearence; but because this is not that important. "You can laugh easier at someone
            for
            something unessential."
            <br>&emsp;And my feeling in all of this, is of all the things I care to do, or am asked by, so is it my
            hygiene which asks the most. Interestingly, it may seem otherwise, that it is in fact easy and smooth.
            But
            only, as I'd suspect, because it is so essential and we do so much. But when I am drunk, tired, sick and
            what not, brushing my teeth, bathing, washing our sheets and clothes, this is the last thing I wish to
            do.

            Being me, oh, how so fine this is, and rich in plenty. More can be done sure, as there are mountains and
            clouds to further gleam; but oh my, is there enough to make me full.
            <br>&emsp;Our rythm is strict and simple. Wake up, quickly change, and off you go. Prioritize your work,
            converse, go home and redress, then run, breathe, write and or play. A rainy day only brings me closer,
            trying our habits, holding us off from warmer times. But we are still warm by me.
            <br>&emsp;The spring air is coming, soft dry grass, fluffy clouds, mellow evenings showing mountains far
            and
            high. We are not so poor in our affairs, as we have some money, are without debt, hold much privalge and
            fortune; but still guided by strenght, sensibility, and a more or less able hand. "One of which, however
            less in proportiona, is in motion; and thus not burdened by idle scorn: I already am."
            <br>&emsp;I hear though that many die from cars, or depression, or even murder; and all illness to boot;
            from this spot of land to those beyond Barute. And I can't help but think that were unafraid of this;
            and
            considering how well we are about it, so are future fears not further burdens. "We're already fine with
            the
            way things are. By ignorance though." National and or state security feels like something none tarnish
            lightly. And it is wise to remember that in the past, much time and or provocation has occured for these
            things to occur. Such things are thematically common, but usually with time in between. "In those
            moments,
            the prior conflicts were a memory; like our own adolescence, or youth rather, and how it seemed an age
            ago.
            Covid evne seems long forgotten."
            <br>&emsp;I feel lost without devotion; to ourselves or the world. But I am fundementally thrown off,
            for
            what it's worth, when the unneccessity of such is made by our natural fortuity, and calm and merry
            harmony
            with such; but, if and when were out of touch, we are not ourselves, nor so morally devoted, 'as if
            there
            were some brace, be it to what's outside or in'. I have consented to such strucutres in the past, but
            only
            see them as consallations for the inability to merrily be. Such is the cost of our actions, being so
            near,

            It seems our debt in time, to floudner over the proper regards for living. Do we remark upon such things
            as
            if they were objects, and gently drift among them, 'by ease, earning their gain', or devoting ourselves?
            Or
            is this just something basic which we ought not so primarily regard: even if communicating such things
            is
            hard, and perhaps a motivator, or impetus for you to see them in the former way.
            <br>&emsp;What is so odd then about these things. For you know their important, by virute of their
            abscence
            at least. Nor do you always wish to abide. I think where I lie, is that, be it for promise or
            sustenance,
            you in some oblige, and all things mold themselves as either neccessary or complimentary elements. Where
            I
            lie, is that this sort of direction, 'or guiding line', does not apply to me; or never has at least.
            I've
            found so much ease and pleasantry in the simplicity of life, and albeit lined with much of the comforts
            which that common life provides, so were these consumed by our childish basis: for the effects of them
            had
            no responsibility which we deemed them contradicotry towards. I"ve just never found much more to life
            then
            this.
            <br>&emsp;There are just so many things to consider, and I tend not to remark up but a few. And I take
            great
            respite in this, for, in ignoring so much, and nothing ill coming to pass, I see how little things
            matter.
            It is my particularly place in the world which affords this; but still, even those in much worse of
            places,
            would likely see that there was little but the most basest of restrictions or intrustions which affected
            them at all.
            <br>&emsp;I sit simply, in this ample mode, which says that near and within, there lies a world of
            possible
            regard; and that from donig so, you become stable, happy and pure. While those who rest above this, find
            much care and pleasure in the broader things of the world. This is fine, but is not enjoyed in the same
            way
            had you been more inwardly fine. Nor, in doing so, do you find either much interest or ability (to
            pursuse)
            such farther ends. As you see already the paradise around. "IT is just ever so hard to meet this: for it
            requires you to be honest, give up glory and acclaim, nor pronounce the indifference in the world, as if
            something ill won't happen. Were just too fine with it ."

            It is not wrong for me not to be right. I'd give my life for another with a calm charm; though, I
            wouldn't
            necceasrily take that of another to do so. If need be I would, but not in defensive aggression. But my
            morals, my honor, my plea, is not but an inquiry. As to the world and what it may be; and how my
            personal
            experience, or dealings rather, speak to me, and in which ways might our impression of this be wrong.
            <br>&emsp;For my sensibilities are innately modern, as all books I've read or words I've heard, 'being
            raised in a non ecclesiast school', is secular, naturally driven, and otherwise contemporily modern. As
            such, when a hurricane appears, or some great incident spurrs infront my eyes, I have little inclination
            to
            believe it is anything but nature making this. The point being, that I have very little suscipions of
            anything, and am thus inclined to let things be, as they seem naturally, and align ourselves as if those
            actions continue to be.
            <br>&emsp;In a word, our mode of being is one that is in harmony with nature, as she seems at least, and
            is
            (by our baser inclinations) effective ordinarily. And so I my expeirence with things is taken at such a
            glance, and not by anything of a miraculous or revealed sort. "Nature is just being her way, and we are
            in
            relation to that; and ordering ourselves accordingly; with expectations at least."
            <br>&emsp;This is just an explanation as to why I may feel so comfortable as I do. For, with nature
            acting
            rather continuously, and not being willfully governed or arranged as some esteem, than my harmony in
            life is
            brought by our rapor with the apparent motions of nature. This is just a result of us treating things so
            naturally, and, in this being so original, so are we left we not pretensions about death. For the topic
            never comes up; nor am I driven to through curiosity to anything built on what I cannot see. It is so
            hard
            to feel like it is not an end of nothing. Which I can only describe though as peacefull and plenty. "I
            have
            no pretensions regarding there being an afterlife, and any risk of not entering it. Nor, of any
            recourse, as
            if there were some harsh alternative. Nor, in any sentimental way, are we endowed to the concept of a
            soul,
            and how, in no longer living, this is somehow poor: if, that is, we simply enter a deep and barren
            rest." My
            natural living procurres much grace to the alternative, and, more or less, natural perspective: as it
            relates to what I am best given in our living harmony, a mere moments rest. "An eternity of which is not
            so
            begrudging."
            <br>&emsp;The world has rooted me such though, as it offers me nothing else; anything it does is of a
            natural sort, 'while those who esteem otherwise, do so by their means and right, but privately, and with
            no
            contempt or ardour'. As such, the world has flowed along, and become, in its bearings, rather natural:
            seeing life, or the people in it rather, as equal in kind and as such equally deserving.
            <br>&emsp;In our scenario though, there is nothing old about me, in our whimsy and ways. But, in this,
            while
            those encased by the past do so with no reign or fury, 'but privatley as they please', so are we
            otherwise
            in the world of liberty; but one, in which the roots of it are mending the pains of the past: be it in
            civility or institutiional resolve. I am otherwise amidst the open plains of freedom and beauty. But
            alone
            somewhat. As most folk seem sequestered in their occupations and pleasantry. While others are in the
            mines,
            the pits so to speak, mending the pipes, 'and speaking out to those up on the common land, asking them
            to
            stop throwing their garbage and filth inside'.
            <br>&emsp;I take for granted that our life is so free and fine, that I don't actually know if a pipe
            could
            burst below. I am just not sure. And this bother's me, for in that end, I am swalloed like the rest.

            What would make me happy? Someone to play games with! It would be so much easier, as I cannot find it in
            me
            to play things, less there new, or their for me. This is hard to find though, and I acknowledge that.
            Perhaps we could do a better job of finding out what people like, even if on the face of it, were not so
            compatable, or more than collegues.
            <br>&emsp;What I seek is vitality, and an ample process to it. I like what comes from this naturally,
            and in
            that motion, I can stear, or guide it at least, 'like a kite in the wind'.
            <br>&emsp;Maybe an important aspect is of our skinnienss, and how for years, this has generally
            pressured me
            into exercising in ways unfitting for happiness. For I care for things of the latter, but ware myself
            down
            when I do the former in excess --for other reasons. It seems, that you need only be active. And upon
            doing
            so, stand, fold, hold and sit with a sort of deliberation, if your natural gait cares not. This is
            enough.
            Running, with some added squats, pushups perhaps, and or pullups if the time is right. This is a fine
            line
            of activity, easy to follow or lead into work, and can, by your state, extend into those rigorous
            motions.
            Just being active is always enough. And by our sense may we properly stretch, or, if dullness or
            workedness
            holds you back, then follow a guide: or some other means of doing so deliberately.

            of our effort, 'as if it were silly and lame'.
            <br>&emsp;I do try and learn something from this, for the position were in, be it in choice or the
            candour
            of our steps, may be off. But I also recognize, that this is part of the way; and in many ways, our
            grievence upon this is merely from our lack of clarity. In many ways we then fear the sight of others,
            for
            we are not clear of the truth ourselves.

            So I am not sure how Amon feels. I suspect she is not so romantically inclined. She may even be married.
            I
            am not certain of her last name, but, how it is in my memory, I saw someone on facebook ---who
            coincidentally looks alot like her-- and that person was married. At any rate, she may just be
            responding to
            me, as I have been relatively nice. She makes weird laughs, like she's nervous; but this could not be
            the
            case.
            <br>&emsp;Where I stand, is that i really don't care for her that much ; I want her, as i did Simron,
            but I
            don't actually like her that much. There isn't much to give then, and the sex and romance, or idea at
            least,
            which I'd love, is a mere fantasy. I won't speak for all women, but their people; and like Holly, have
            their
            own live's. Who they like, or are already dating, is a mere elemnt of their life, drawn by what they
            actually see. We've always been quick to belef that we are so likable; but likely because we are very
            open,
            with energy and kind. But that they respond to this in any fashion, does not mean their entranced by
            you.
            <br>&emsp;She may not be the person I'm with, and, admittedly, the feeling I get is one where she does
            like
            me. But I will not stand firm with this. Nor am I of the belief that we can 'hit it then quit it'. I'd
            rather live right, and get what I need.

            So things are well, as am I. Were pretty even, and quite grounded in our work and ways.
            <br>&emsp;I am noticing though that were not so privy to fun; and the notion of going for a smoke with
            our
            friends, or out with a woman, is quite sombering. I've not procurred any of this, and for the most part,
            I'm
            not to drawn to these things. But when were not so thrilled, or feeling a bit idle, I feel this weight,
            'as
            if a defensive means to cope with our lack', which says such things are bad.
            <br>&emsp;This respnose, albeit a mark of our lack, but also a mere exageration of what I really feel,
            'which is not to woman or drugs', is really brought out when we lack sight of our actual cares. The sun
            and
            her coming, the clouds and their pace; games, shows, videos and craft, all swim together in a stream of
            interest. Yet, like fish, they go on by, leaving me with mere glimmers, 'of there underwater
            complexion'.
            <br>&emsp;So, it is nice out, a bit chilly, but with a fair amount of clouds. There quite dense, adding
            to
            the chill, but not so much from the south. If there is overcast, then the early day will bear our
            grandeur.
            But if there is some clarity in the sky, then the evening will hold some deep blues. I mean to go to
            freshco
            for springrolls, and Superstore for Djon chips, but I'm not sure if we should go this afternoon, or wait
            for
            the approach to night.
            <br>&emsp;So theres a bit of a blurr in the north, and tuffs in the south.Things seem to be blowing
            upwards,
            which bodes well for the afternoon. But it is cold, so we'll have to bundle up for the evening. I don't
            mean
            to eat till after then, so we could go then. But I might just go this afternoon, and have our grains
            prior
            to the stroll. Maybe we'll go down Ford; but if it's to cold we'll stay in the town. "The open land can
            be
            windy."

            Thematically, I sought war. But practically, I see more promise form exploration domination --of the
            seas if
            you will. Your settlement is naturally low in antiquity, and your ability to match the Ai's strenght is
            here
            most handicapped. A true war game would see us prioritize such conquest; though, to what further end I
            do
            not know. But as regards our exploration seige, so does this require science. There is benefit,
            generally,
            in having 5 cities of your own plus 2 which you take; as this gives +2 settlement limit in exploration.
            You
            may arrange your targts and or relations for the end of the age, and take those 2, or, if it pleases
            you,
            attack another's major settlements. The most important thing is having an empire which is close
            together. It
            means that resoruces can be exchanged, but, primarily, you can support yourelf defensvieyl. If your too
            spread out, then you have to send units over long distances, and, because you don't know how much you
            need,
            you end up sending more. If everything is close, you may surive with less, and back them up more easily
            if
            need be. This allows for focosu on your economy. Equally, if your empire is secure, than you can spend
            that
            prolonged amount of production on protecting your city states. Your own settlements ought not be the
            same.
            <br>&emsp;No matter, the question of exploration rests on whether to invest in cities, build them up,
            then
            retain a culture or science element. Or do you retain the gold, and keep them as cities. For you will
            have
            to buy them again; at least to be productive. At the very least you want one coastal settlement; as you
            can
            freely select this as your second capital. The third city then is 200, and I believe the fourth is 400.
            If
            you consider then, that your early exploration cities can only build units and warehouse buildings, then
            it
            does not seem necessary for you to have so much. Meaning, if you spend the gold in antiquity to convert
            a
            bunch of cities, you benefit less from keeping them as cities, as there's little for them to do;
            comapred to
            benefiting from the productions of their antiquity state. The more cities with academies means a better
            science start. This may transition into cities being sought; but for 600 gold you'll have 4 as it is.
            And
            there is not the same advantage going into modern for having so many cities. You may keep them as
            cities,
            which is equally unpromising for early modern as it was for early exploration; you can get university
            boosts, like academies --their inherent is nearly the same. Or, you can keep your relgious founder
            belief.
            This may amount to +4 gold, science or culture per foreign settlement. You can spam missionaries near
            the
            end of the age, and with a few turns left, convert everyone, then have a big mass of +4s. This could
            fairly
            reach 100 yields. Even if you have 10 cities, which is perhaps unrealistic, your likely to have +5 base
            yields on universites, and some manner of +2-3 adj. This isn't bad, but costs a huge amount of gold; as
            you
            must make everything into cities, then research the end of science tree to get university, then have
            time to
            build them. It may be easier converting 20 settlements, then having 8 cities with +10 universites.

            I seldom speak of the morning, 'as such light not often reaches my eyes'. But, even then, there is that
            first sliver of light, which adds a tingling of white and blue. Then, leading into the sun, there is
            that
            awning of visibility, a moment of red; followed then by the narrow stream of yeloowing, piercing the
            trees.
            "this compares with those final moments of sunset, when the light is so horiztonal, it shines through
            everything: equally so on the rise."
            <br>&emsp;From here my day is guided more by habit than lust. But, early on, there is a quiet tone to
            the
            color, and thereby no rush to go out (especially) and see. But the sun does come over the horizon, and
            from
            there, bathes the land prominently in light. Here, everything is seen in full color and saturation, but
            not
            so washed out by the pinnacle point of light, when the sun is strictly over head. "The in between of
            dawn
            and midday."
            <br>&emsp;As she hits her peak, and falls over, you get a warmth softness to everything. Where the heat
            of
            the day has sunk in, and in east, the sky is a rich blue. This is one of my favorite times, as
            everything is
            allowed to have it's full saturation and color, 'as that midpoint to midday'; only, with the sun having
            been, and falling away, everything feels a bit more cooked and heated; but, to the point, almost settled
            from that peak moment during midday; whereupon the color and creamness is all there is, but withotu that
            washing light, 'as the sun reaches early evening'.
            <br>&emsp;During that though, when day is coming to set, you have a sort of cease of natural warmth, and
            instead pure vibrance. For whatever reason, this setting holds longer color than it does when rising;
            and as
            such, if there are wisps of cloud in the air, so is this setting nice. The light come's to that parallel
            pitch, shining onto houses and through trees, then fully hides. From here, there is a pale boredom,
            'similar
            to that moment right before sunrise'. But, as this paleness deepens, there's left a contrast of color on
            the
            mountains and clouds. The sky begins to thicken, deepening from quiet to thick dark blue. If the gods
            are
            generous, they'll leave nice dry and puffy clouds in the east; which, for whatever reason, bear the
            lingering loud more than all the land around, and thus shine's whiter than you'd expect. As darkness
            proceeds, there is little but a blue velvet in the sky, and a quaint grey in the west: night has come.
            <br>&emsp;To those with a keen eye, there is still grandeur in this hidden time. For the moon,
            explicitly,
            lights the land in an equally nice way; showing mountains and distance more than you'd otherwise see.
            "Which
            makes it feel like were privy to the land while it sleeps." Otherwise, with no moon, the scenery is not
            the
            nights esteem. Rather, the sky, if open, is still visible; in either it's speckle of stars, or the
            quietly
            lit clouds. "Which add a great texture to the empty night." There is always light then, and only a
            blanked
            overcast can remove such; as it does during the day.

            I am finely employed. I say this, as if to honor what may be true, that we are not so fufilled in this;
            as,
            our time alloted is relatively small.
            <br>&emsp;It is not short of much which we'd do otherwise, but still not there.
            <br>&emsp;We are given means for food though; and I care not for our room. But, like Jess, if we were
            working much more, we'd still have the same fortune. Whether it be just, or by my content to stand by,
            the
            position remains.
            <br>&emsp;In that state, we are calm and proceeding; coming and going to work, with relative ease. I
            feel
            the ware, and our bonds with other's is forever in motion; but our brace of strenght, aerobics and
            breathing
            is more or less secure; as is our food fairly strong. The latter though is still ironing itself out; but
            mostly due to our alignment with the time of day.
            <br>&emsp;No matter, I can relate, or at least compare, how some few months ago we were equally
            pronounced
            and well off; yet also missing, unsure, and with a mind for change. Now, we may be deemed to ill-just
            and
            asked to further our load; or we may make on, and only have our time to anwser to.
            <br>&emsp;The weight behind me is something I feel when our proper procedure is off. For we are of some
            mix
            uncomposed, nor drawn. And so the lack of friends and goings feels like a tear; as does our mind get
            caught
            in the gruff of imagery. Our state has mended this though, by using our ripe time to currate some
            postive
            remarks, and by that, establish ourselves as properly seperate from those chimeras; but to also mend
            their
            nature, 'as to not see them, or believe them, as so fiery and tyrannical'. The nature of war has
            loosened
            her grip on me in this regards, as have our own modern risks. The notion that things unfamiliar enlarge
            their proportions, 'of what seems good or awful'; and further so, if such thing is far away, by land or
            memory. "Reading then brings us close, and we feel proper remorse and stability regarding what has
            occured,
            and might come." So much that we are elevated above needing to define it; as we can sit with the
            actuality
            in our mind, and not feel like it is to illusroy as not be warrant naughing it. "It used to feel like
            there
            was this loose thread beneath me. Now, albeit of an iron red and hot, so does our mind cool it; as a
            perception at least."
            <br>&emsp;I know, be it a minute or some furthe equivalent of a mile, I will feel idle, more than likely
            stiff, and, in short, drawn to some point of comfort, a recession; for being still, free and simple,
            will
            feel bared upon by some crack in our circumstance, our some blurredness in the goods we otherwise see.
            "From
            within we'll collapse, from without, we are not held: and each bit of these motions is counterblanced by
            something which can only be defined as vice: not becase of what they are, but what is observed in what
            they
            produce: they are not absent of where they came from, being the good, but rather detriments born in
            response
            to a lack of good: and however you look at it, these things, which are not themselves the good, in
            principle
            create something which is thus: and all the more likely, 'as our actions tend to carry themseles
            immoderately, or at least outside of brief minutia', to ends which are clearly bad." I know this will
            happen.
            <br>&emsp;But I will say still, having the content and grace to still look on, 'even if in certain
            vain',
            that our ends are so more eligble and pure. Yet, in all things which these notions remark, there lacks a
            real concept of practice and objective. For we see, in our moments of a finer type, what we'd like to
            occur.
            We wish to write, share ideas, expound our values and cares. And this has always seemed fine, as the
            more we
            knew of such matters, and flourished in resulting ways, 'our time of offering this seemed more secure'.
            But
            the actual progress of this has not come into a state which is more solid, 'and easily sprung forth
            based on
            the bounty I've established'. For one, we still have no ideas, nor really wish to. But the inquirie's
            we've
            made, whether in truth brilliant or amateurish, are not of much common value. Nor in our candor and
            might,
            is there room outside of the particular things your doing. "You are not nor will be king, nor are set
            for
            acclamtion and gain, based on who you purely are. You must perform, give, create." And such things are
            more
            or less absent of me.
            <br>&emsp;Where were left then, is perhaps a true direction of peace. For in all our reflections, it
            would
            seem just and fair to admitt that our cares for fame and impact, only came based on our own shortcoming
            of
            ideas, 'and any of them which dealt with things of a frightening sort; the ill-clarity of which made it
            harder to sit with, and thus compelled me to expound forth, as to remove the weight of such notions via
            the
            consquent effect of motion'. Instead, it seems that as our ideas align, or at least bud themselves into
            a
            calm and collected state, 'be it through further motion or serenity', that so are we more or less dealt
            a
            road which is not so foolishly motivated; a path which is born of pure direction, in that we can be set
            and
            betrothed to where we actual see a flourishing, rather than running, to cleanse our uneven insides.
            <br>&emsp;But, of what I'd like, I do not know. And right to the point, there is armour I have, which
            perhaps could be finely admitted in our lighter time. But right now, all I can say, is that alhtough our
            moments feel limbre and dear, so is there a thinness to our depths; regarding our broader desires at
            least.
            For there is so much strenght which we have, and a meadow of cheer and gladness moated about; but not
            much
            of far off things, or times further. Were stuck in this barrated response, 'which our composure and
            delight
            was formed against'. What were responding to here, 'as if an learned response', is the armour. We ought
            take
            it off, or at least progress the truth. For I am in all ways fine, but with no real end. And of those
            which
            we don't consent to out of being merely common, so are these more weighing against. "For our absent of
            travel for instance, although parlayed as some wonderful experience, is not so ladden upon me as having
            children, a home, a marriage. Similarly, the virtue and or propiety in volunteer work, speaking up,
            'caring
            for those outside your nearby gaze', so does this feel woffted in the air; and by that, inflamatory to
            our
            otherwise imagined view of foreign things: details of which we have not thought of: but of that rightous
            scent, so does it make me appeal to things which are otherwise improperly deemed. Like were spurred to
            remark upon our imagination, and beckon to it as if it were real: which is indeed the cause of wearly
            defining things, or bearing rancour."

            So, looking over our morning routine, as if on a pure basis, there is a clear difference from planning
            for
            aerobics or not. If it is the former, we still act as though were not doing it, walking at least two
            times,
            then having some ruffage. This is fine sometimes, but can ware me out before even running. I have
            experienced drawbacks from getting up and going for a run, but there ought be somewhere in between.
            <br>&emsp;I think were underestimating how much our stretching leavens us out, as to only walk once,
            then
            run. Plus, our running is more along the lines of free range. And you may simply do that at home and
            call
            her a day. As you may wish to go to the park and read.
            <br>&emsp;I think the issue is that we ought often want different things. We may be clambering to read;
            and
            if such, going out early is our goal; but thereby, we need less prior. There is a real effect from
            walking,
            and perhaps it is our body being in a worn or recovered state that limits how much we can do. But we can
            act
            properly throughout the day to mend what were compramising with. If you went for a walk, then came home,
            stretched and went for a read and or run, then a solid walk after this would likely soothe us out. We
            may
            fruit after our first venture, then perhaps a smoothie, protein, energy. All I see is that as the
            afternoon
            sets in --following midday- that from there were back out, be it to the parks, the farms, or for chores
            yet
            to do. From here it's grain time, and likely two servings, leading into the blue hour.
            <br>&emsp;It seems were set for a walk upon waking, with no ware on me, followed by one leading into
            midday.
            There is room for strolls and or novelty, based on interest, the short nature of these, and your
            solidty.
            But we can fit life in between; and not feel so worn if we do. For there is more through the day. And,
            I've
            found, that by exhibiting primary things, that your need to 'bolden yourself out' through the same kind
            of
            them is not neccessary. Walking bears me a easy breathe, a plump body and means to see. But this is an
            exerting means, which forming motions can produce. These are moments during the day, when you stand
            tall,
            upright, breathe, fold and or hold, and this gives the rythm of your morning, afternoon, evening and
            sleep a
            secure foundation. Running does elevate you, but it also aims at giving you room to relax and breathe.
            You
            need not do it to keep you upright; it is what is done when you already are.
            <br>&emsp;I don't wish to compartmentalize this, but merely adjust some our habits. For we've felt for
            so
            long that two walks was required before eating, reading, games or watching was allowed. But were going
            out
            now, to the park, for chores, or to read and what not. The point being, is that, if you have the right
            form,
            and retain the core benefit from your walks, aerobics and strenght, then you can angle these to account
            for
            your life. "Which, upon being set upon an overworked foundation, becomes a load upon that, or, from such
            shaky foundation, is not so seen, and thus of less interest."
            <br>&emsp;Writing is important to me, as is reading and games, stretching and the sun. But I also care
            about
            these, beyond there esscence upon me. This is my life; I form my time and deeds around it.

            So we've had a relatively solid day. The morning was a bit embellished; which we've reflected on. But
            going
            out for a scoot prior to midday was so nice; sitting at industrie's edge, and reading Surgeon From
            Belgium
            --which has been lovely.
            <br>&emsp;What's carrying my thought is this sense of stable rythm; where, if we sought to, we could eat
            terribly, smoke, care nothing for work besides us going to it. And we'd be swell, making money, solid at
            home. Just the idea that we are so well is pleasing to me. And all I mean for this entry, is to better
            exclaim how we can live more fully amidst this rythm. As having more definite things to look forward to
            makes our freedom a bearer to comfort. But concerning the shades of light and or weather, the right
            amount
            to stretch, eat and walk, while we leisure through, is less clear. "And not so benefited by having to
            think
            of it. You want to do well as not to burn out or fallow away; but also feel firm and ready to do as you
            please; be it reading, writing, gaming or craft."
            <br>&emsp;As it were, walking need not be this constant exertion, for we have yoga. Running may be done
            as a
            casing around milder aerobics --which can be done almost any day. The afternoon is the least pleasing
            time,
            and fits well as a point of routine and siesta; where we do our laundry, shower, jerk off, cook, and
            then
            rinse and sleep. We may also eat energy foods, such as smoothies, edamame or veg. And in multiple
            servings.
            A grand walk may lead into this, whereby our initial walk can lead into our training and or morning
            ventures; followed then by another midday walk, which leavens us out for lunch and rest. "This is also a
            great time for movies and shows, or real gaming. Leave Battlefield, baser writing and outdoor books for
            your
            the morning, and such venture."
            <br>&emsp;The issue I am facing, or have seen today, is one of the evening. For the afternoon begins to
            dip,
            and the light begins to shine towards everything, giving a nice heat to the sky and land. This is a
            great
            time to go out. But the balance is that I assuredly wish to go out for the nautical dusk; at the very
            least
            mind you, as sunset is it's own missed grandeur. There's just so many moments to take pleasure in, nor a
            clear expectation as to which scenery (beyond the sky's color) what will be prestine. Baker may be
            fuzzed,
            as may there be overcast towards the moutains. This morning for instance, the clouds were few yet puffy;
            but
            into the evening the fizzled out into a course haze. All in the east mind you, while the west was rather
            clear, with definite whisps.

            So the golden hour is akin to the blue hour, as a character'd view of time. In reality, there is early,
            mid
            and late morning, and the same for afternoon and evening. Mid morning is that time when the shadows are
            deepening and the color is vibrant, but not to washed out as midday. While the mirror of this is mid
            afternoon, though late afternoon has it's own manner of warmth. Evening begins as the sun prominently
            sets,
            into the golden hour and into twilight. Late evening though includes dusk.

            So it seems perhaps that heavier training will always drain you; and place you in a state that wishes to
            rest and londer. This is fine.
            <br>&emsp;Going for one longer walk, stretching, then working out felt fine. But everything has been
            reached
            early. This is alright. The day is not so grand, and so there's no rush to go out there. We need to
            shower;
            jerk off, and if to porn, watch pornstars, or people with names at least; as this removes the illusion
            that
            ordinary people are doing this. There's a good smoothie coming, as well as corn, quinoa and lentils.
            There's
            great mini hashbrowsn, our bagels, cucumber and nuts.

            I tend to shy away from strict sentiment. "You must have protein, be it tuna or edamame, following a
            workout." But I also recognize that these things may be missed otherwise, and their kind of contribution
            lost.
            <br>&emsp;The issue though is how we usually go about our day. For I don't have this merry acceptance of
            tuna, as it feels acidic; the form of it is light, compared to chicken, but only in the richest of
            protein
            needs do I care for it. Edamame is much lighter though, in acidity, but also not as anabolic. This is
            fine
            when you've done just a bit. But I also have a small aversion to eating so much, 'as if the soy is
            somewhat
            odd'. There is no clear alternative then. But, the point, is that you tend not to need such things
            wholeheartedly; and if you do, then soy or tuna is welcomed. It would seem wise to consider bulk
            purchasing,
            so we know it's available. As right now, we buy a bag for 3$, and it has 2 big servings, or several
            which
            you mix with grain. Indeed, that is how you can furnish your general needs; as they become elevated
            following prior sessions. "It's only when the session is clearly large, or your in a state where you
            wish
            for protein: as if you feel your store is low."
            <br>&emsp;It seems then that if your just being active, or at best doing something aerobic, then you
            might
            have roughage in the morning, then a smoothie or two during the day. In fact, I find this, albeit beyond
            neccessity, a great addition to our life. A smaller smoothie satiates me, and more or less nourishes me,
            but
            then, upon another, keeps me full for the midday; which is often the hardest point. As, going to late
            afternoon, you may go on a post-rest/midday walk, and go out for a read, or to shop. And following this
            your
            likely to eat grains, and mozzy onto the evening.
            <br>&emsp;These aspects feel clearer. And, unlike proteins, which I am more reluctant to be constant
            with,
            so is our smoothie, like an orange or peanut+kale, so good and clear, that I'm fine making it so
            constant.

            So there's a clear moment coming out of the morning, after noon, and some blend of evening, that holds
            our
            ventures for the day.
            <br>&emsp;That we would walk, stretch, run and or train is one thing; as it is one thing for us to eat
            veg,
            fruit, smoothies or grain, and in which proportion.
            <br>&emsp;In sinking into these though, we may firmly and happily move through our life; as the core of
            it
            is set, as are we doing something relatively good in itself. It's those dear linens which marble me, be
            it
            in books, gaming or craft. But it is upon our life which this flows.
            <br>&emsp;Truly, I know not what the future holds. Our need for a child is more along the line's of
            eventuality, and thus a woman for that. But, our choices have brought us away from where we've ever
            been,
            and as such, have dealt us little of connection. As we felt near the end of Vancouver, and are feeling
            now,
            that of our responsability, at least it's blending as a duty with your liberties, so must we maintain
            ourselves in order to stand above this, 'and ride the current' so to speak. For what happens, is we
            begin
            something, and go through the motions of living in relation to it as a deed. But through initial
            fortitude
            and endurance through habit, we loose this sense of weight and any according apprehension. Seeing as
            what we
            bear is the means to live, so is our rythm with this one of just freedom: for what we see is on and from
            right and stable grounds. Every time we move then and have to begin, we redo this process. And indeed,
            the
            fairest mistake I've made, 'where we almost succumb to the plea of weakness', was when we left
            Superstore in
            October 2020; for during that time, we had floated above our duty and we relatively well. But we felt
            wrong
            for being so content; and seeing as there was something we felt proper to see, of something at least, so
            did
            such sights become dreams, 'and procastinations for which we could leave work, then eventually work
            for'.
            <br>&emsp;I see now more than ever that a) we can and will rest above our endebted grounds, and b) find
            a
            sort of reason and strenght to flourish, which, through constancy and grace, we'll see things from such
            point of where, 'from our content, as opposed to spiting it'.

            There is a proper state which is so challenging to describe. It reflects a midway between the ultimate
            development of time, and how your not so fordrawn to it, 'like those dreaming or yearning', nor so
            quenched
            and hidden, 'like those depressed, head down, unable to see ahead'.
            <br>&emsp;The state were talking about is a flourishing, eudymonia, a burdenless delight. In this, we
            are
            above our tasks; making them thus deeds rather than burdens. "As, being duties, they fall to either
            side."
            <br>&emsp;I stand though with a little uncertainty of things. For the elements of a dream, or foresight
            rather, need not reflect what one may experience in the present. The key example of this is our
            education,
            and how it aims at offering us a career, and a better one the longer we are educated; but without an end
            is
            this based, besides presumed matters. "We delight and align ourselves to our progress, only to reach a
            point
            which was not exactly the source of such good." There would be few mid-life crisis' if this weren't so,
            nor
            so much family fighting or contempt.
            <br>&emsp;The point then, is that of our current strides, I see, from memory and its relation to our
            present
            actions, how such things are not so clear; as they are with respect to a future we once deemed. Writing
            and
            study shine brightly here, or obscurely rather; as I once saw them as the basis for some acclaimed and
            generous project; but the form of this was never so clear, or at least it was taken for granted. Now, I
            am
            not so espoused to such dream; but the fact that were still writing leaves me somewhat unsure as to the
            nature of this; and what it, in truth means. For in our far seeing ways, it is novel and or presumed
            formations which bear our passion and intrigue. "Our ideas are held in us, and like a heartbeat, pace
            away
            by their excitable nature; but all formed and heralded by some assumed mold. Some foundation which we
            feel
            like will naturally do; yet we know little of this, and are merely carried by the nature of our
            interests,
            rather than the operation." The point though, is that of writing and study and all things of the sort, I
            do
            care. In fact, I am delighted by them further. "As the release of our dreaming yields me more freedom
            and
            cheer to do them more; as were neither waiting nor begrieved of our joy and content." But in this, I am
            not
            clear about what they mean at all. As if our presumptions, in being so clearly faulty when brought
            close,
            leaves me with little that is actually laudible; as our present solidity makes such things viewed under
            such
            calm and cheery ways. Our lack of knowledge then is only clear. And, for clarity's sake, this notion of
            the
            form, 'or way of operation', is merely an ember from our natural ebbs of imperfection; where we gently,
            yet
            slightly still, see, as remarks a mild comparison to a dream, what we are going to do ahead; and, within
            that, the 'idea' or formation which reflects that. "It is as if we had bold views animated by our
            excited
            interests; yet upon rest, the boldness was shown to be hollow and vain. But our interests now, albeit
            fine
            and plenty while were flourishing, 'without the future, or problems of any sort, in sight', can be
            sprung a
            little into seeing further off, and thus binding to some formation. The milder nature of this excitement
            and
            or yearning makes for an accordingly mild form: but of this we don't even know. For in our bolder
            sights,
            the emptiness was not seen, and our elation overtook our sight of it's futility. While now, I see much
            clearer; and it is that of even the smallest of dedications or ends, so don't we know." Which calls for
            an
            inquiry of the simplest of things.

            The beauty of writing is that it acts like a budget, in that, of all the elements around you, 'be it
            costs
            or income', so can you survery the domain, and from there, more steadily and effectively judge and or
            amend.
            <br>&emsp;Life is no different. As so much comes to us; and much of what we accept, or may, is born from
            the
            past, and not taken notice by me. Which surely leads to ends offered by such means; but not neccesarily
            one's we cared about. For we may be young and solid, but only because we are doing what we perceive to
            be
            right; and enjoying ourselves do to such stability; only to then reach the end, and find that it is not
            one
            which we terribly enjoy. Or, better yet, of all the other things we cared for, 'in our young and free
            going
            way', that so were these ill-fit for the deeper end we reached.
            <br>&emsp;The point is, that writing, as a mode of reflection and inquiry, allows for all things to be
            dealt
            with; and rather simply due to the written nature, as you can speak of one thing, then speak from there;
            whereas in normal conversations, it is hard to build off of old points.
            <br>&emsp;In that, I can see where things are off, and address them. This is so, for our choices have
            not
            brought us to an occupied point, or one with much fun. There is merely peace and joy. Yet this state is
            not
            always filled out, and so the world can bear upon us. This is so, for there is much around us in the way
            of
            suggestion and idea, and our more idle states get sapped up by these, 'and like a blanker canvas,
            saturated'.
            <br>&emsp;What I've noticed is that, compared to your reasons about life's many troubles, 'and upon
            them,
            having some sense prior made as to bring you back to harmony', that so in your studies can you better
            hear
            and let go of random impressions or information. We may not be so susceptible to these, in that we are
            with
            more action. But so is this a weary line; for we may be fine, or at least in need of rest, and thus more
            prone to babbles and authority. "Hereby, lies those idle dreams; as compares to exhaustive effots, which
            will us to move; while these dreams give us some sort of occupation, or cease to indolence, but through
            the
            clarity of the road ahead; giving us more solidity to our point on it now."

            I submitt that our life's aim is a farce. For fortune has gifted me with the riches of simplcity; the
            goods
            which, in receding from the 'want of more', were so much inherently, that I could do little to meet
            them.
            Amidst such breadth, there sat peace: we were well and full, but with ease and senility: no effort, or
            grough rather, for this bounty worthy of kings.
            <br>&emsp;But it is in those motion, whose motivations are a subject of their own --to recede and
            accept--
            that our futility lay. For in this lane, all smooth and lovely, there sat in me a sort of impression.
            One in
            which the world seemed so plain, breezy and fine. So much so, that we bent our recession towards this;
            as we
            had no doubts of the good which was free for the taking; and thus, our satiety by merely existing was
            clearly so, that we were fine to remove our ambition, relish the abscence of duty and deed, and be fine
            with
            the plenty given.
            <br>&emsp;I will state, as if the insight to this inquiry, that this mode of being, of recession, has
            not
            been, nor feels so rightly set, for stability. Accepting that, as I waiver here or there, 'without much
            besides that inherent given', so do we feel drawn to things beyond: from where we've receded from. Only,
            of
            that which animates this motion, 'be it for promise or passion', it comes from the sights we so steadily
            see. "For in our recession, and it's ebbs and flows into full and or lacking satiety, of the things
            which we
            generally see in those moments of peace, so do these become the forms and matter by which our further
            regards are based on." If there is a world out there, full of fun and oppertuntiy, 'which our receded
            postion may yearn for', then of that world and all our potential actions for it, so are they colored and
            baked in the proportions sprung from our receded position.

            So about 7:00, the sun dips to two units ahead. A unit is essentially a point in which, if you sat, it
            would
            move a unit's amount. From sunset up is one 1 unit, and around 7 it was 2 units away. Prior to this, the
            light is rather cool and unremarkable. There is a point around 4 that is warm, soft and rather deep. The
            units between that and the 2 up from sunset is the point where rest, dinner and play are best. There is,
            to
            be fair, a point during the day, leading into that warmer part of the afternoon that is also fair for
            this.
            But, I will admitt, that even the midday can be nice. To a degree, it come's down to atmosphere; as
            there
            being some washes out the light, making the midday poor. As of now, 740 is the stretch, or unit, of
            sunset.
            It is not hard to see, how following this is a cooled unit, which begins to blossom with color, 'upon
            mountain and cloud'. From there, another unit of darkening and blues, and sole remaining highlights on
            clouds, to a final unit of the deepest sorts.
            <br>&emsp;As a quick reflection, if the sun is low, so will the shadows be long. As will the highlights
            be
            warmer, 'as the atmosphere spreads blue light, leaving only warmer yellows and oranges'. Contrast then
            is
            when there is a difference between shadow and highlight.
            <br>&emsp;For our health, we ought attend to strenght training with proper care. This means walks,
            eating
            and stretching which respect it. While mere free range or light running can be accomodate by normal
            procedure.
            <br>&emsp;It is obvious to me that our willfull motions are solid, but that, when our will is gone,
            'upon
            weary and or tightening exertions', so do we need a guide; as this helps our breathing, and also our
            focus.
            For this, we ought finish our YWA, for standing, brief and long, something with warrior, another for
            lifts,
            and one for rest and rinsing. These will do fine: and fit nicely with our already ample norms.
            <br>&emsp;Food wise, we are best to enstate foods which are constant, and thus warrant our indefinite
            regard
            and collection. Oranges are a fresh example, as is kale, peanuts and tomatoes. Avocadoes for instace are
            nice, and subsitute well with tomatoes; but are not a constant. I've decided this so. What I have
            choosen is
            smoothies. As drinking one big one is not as useful or beneficial; as it wares on me more, and leaves me
            hungry sooner. The base of this though, is that smoothies, in smaller portions, ought be had throughout
            the
            day, as with oranges. For this, we need a consistent supply of flax, which is easy, bananas, which can
            be
            easy, though require private storage, milk, which alongside berries is the main expense, and then kale;
            which, although easy, ought be bought in plenty as to allow you to freeze ample amounts. "The key thing
            for
            a constant is to never wonder or doubt whether you can have it."

            So, seeing the day, it seems that from the point that the sun is near setting, to the point in which the
            deep blue is last to be seen, is about 1 hour. I note that there is a point in which you ought be
            present,
            for it makes no sense to state when things are about to slip away.
            <br>&emsp;By that, it seems there is about 15 minutes where the sun has set and all is dull; and then
            the
            lingering reds and oranges seep in. From there, another 15 goes by and the first of the deep blues sinks
            in,
            along with the creamy oranges in the west. It is 15 minutes from here that the cream begins to sink, and
            the
            sky becomes its deepest blue.
            <br>&emsp;In this sense, one could go 15 minutes prior to sunset, leave, then go out for the red, stay
            for
            15 minutes to see the early blues, and wait another to see the deep blue. I admitt that we fail to make
            use
            of our privalage, that we have a yard that looks upon the light. In that though, you could balance each
            point. Indeed, our estimates may be off; though I don't think the time of year alters the rythm of sun
            to
            dark. But, when the reds come in following the set is unclear; as does the atmospher play a solid part.
            As a
            thikcer one makes the early blues less appealling; despite the horizon holding similar colors. The deep
            blue
            is good no matter though.
            <br>&emsp;To bind this together, if there is lingering reds, be it from the light or the clouds, then
            early
            twilight is of worth. Near the end of twilight, the blue's become darker then their color can address,
            nor
            is there much but lingering white light in the west. What we want, is that lingering warmth along with
            the
            darker shades of blue. This marks the middpoint, where that less vibrant part begins, and the blues and
            lingering reds remain; into the black. While the initial part is of the red sky; which is to say, that
            if
            there is something that may catch the beginnings of twilight, then note this; and if note, upon the
            abscence
            of light, yet lingering color, this begins cream of twilight.

            I have an odd reflection. Seemingly, when we were younger, we got cramped down by duty, and responded by
            being merely sufficient, and pleased by comfort. We strove for nothing beyond this.
            <br>&emsp;I am a man of comfort it would seem. But we are also someone who does not like hard work.
            Nothing
            of the sort. But it is so, that for cars, clothes, vacations and or lavishes, you need money; and thus
            need
            to work hard.
            <br>&emsp;I just always found much more good in the simple things of life. But oddly, there is a
            contradiction in our approach. For when girls and vanity were in our sight, we felt poor and hid away.
            While, at some points, we found good elsewhere. In highschool though, for instance, there seemed not
            said
            elsewhere; and so we were always amongst the shadows.
            <br>&emsp;I would say this was caused by our choice to move, as we had no person to find that wholer fun
            with; and so the immediate prescence of duty sunk into me, 'as there was nothing else for me to do'.
            <br>&emsp;I think the worthwhile point is one of effort, or task, and the good that follows. For if
            there is
            much duty, 'of norms of self deemed', then your good may come from the peace in that, and the goods
            harmonious with it. Whereas, a lack of duty, as when we have children, or even now when we are at home
            and
            quite beyond the feeling of stress, we seek more pleasure and fun. "As there is less sense of
            consqeunce."
            Of course sugar and comfort is good; but they're careless, or fitting for such, by nature.
            <br>&emsp;Where I am a little unclear is the matters of sex, infamy and thrills. Partying, cars, fun
            trips,
            these are an odd appointment. For they come through lucrative means; but of their motivation, I am not
            sure.
            Are they a result of doing well, be it born of stress or genuine care? Or are they born of fear, 'as if
            one
            could not be pleased with simplicity, and thus were unfufilled and or insecure without bolder kinds of
            fun,
            and status'.
            <br>&emsp;What I notice, and how this ties back to our youth, is that not all people are alike, in their
            interests and desire. What we value and or are tasked to do, 'as bade by our rearing', also differs, and
            so
            our motivations may lean similar to those with such roots. But I see, that if it is a certain kind of
            fun or
            comfort, that there are people also seeking that. This is why our choice of moving has been so harsh on
            us;
            as those who would have been potential friends for me were not near me enough to procure so. But I see,
            and
            believe, that be it of peace and joy, or fun and full comfort, that there are women, men, allies of the
            sort, who may find harmony with you.

            I see a whole balance and blend, as regards our interests and reserve. It comes down to how you are, how
            things are, what is asked upon you, whether to believe it or not. Cirumstance alters this, 'as you may
            go
            from a point which was well comforted and stable, to one which holds less, and perhaps asks even more:
            to
            which you alter'.
            <br>&emsp;It is plain that without much duty, you'll find joy in comfort; and without much reserve. You
            will
            recgonize that there are some duties, be it in sports or chores; along with your common attendances. But
            of
            what you have to do, so can you dine and delight upon finishing.
            <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to much of luxury and such, but it does feel to me a bit far off from
            responsability; and I don't prefer the stark differnce

            For whicever reason, the state were in, or ease of duty, alters my sense of right and wrong, and what is
            to
            be desired. For if we were like a kid, I'd say our duty was low, and that we could embellish from there.
            The
            truth though, is that we may live like that by our own means. The bar is a bit higher; but I contend,
            upon
            leaving Vancouver, that we had just reached over it. And right now, I can see how working not much more
            than
            we do right now would be sufficeint; and completly.
            <br>&emsp;I think where my life has eroded, is in our wish to be our strongest self; for in that, the
            experience I seek, of action, is brought forward the most. I don't believe that we must be passive to be
            friends with many people; or amongst many. But I do feel like your place with them is best tempered, 'as
            to
            be a member'. By my counts, the deeper, meaningfull conversations, or interactions around people is what
            is
            pleasing to me. I don't wish to be impartial amongst a mass of folk; and being around so many tends to
            do
            this. Or I just wish to leave.
            <br>&emsp;If someone said, 'you may have a kid, but must work for them indeterminately, or you may never
            have one'; I think I would lean to the latter. Never in my childhood or youth have I ever thought of
            such
            things, in a desirous sense. Nor in my adult age have I held much interest. Regarding this, and marriage
            and
            a home espeicallly, all I saw was a massive undertaking. And I still maintain that considering our dear
            interests, and their close nature, that of the simplicity needed for this, that so is our child an
            extension
            ontop of that; and of a similar principle, in that they are not bound for things beyond ourself. I need
            little, and so will they.
            <br>&emsp;From this, I lean on the simplicity which we have found; be it at home or on our own; we may
            elevate above this, and stabily flourish. I admitt there were fears and rot desires beneath me

            So I can speak to me life as it is, but my aim is to speak about what it could be, ought be, how I'd
            like
            it.
            <br>&emsp;I think people make the mistake of looking far ahead; or better yet, finding obejcts which
            they'd
            like. "As if it were some buffee, and you selected this or that point."
            <br>&emsp;I prefer to give our life some strucutre based on how it's been; and considering what we've
            learned, how to implement that, and by that, remark our direction. For that is all anyone seeks, to be
            set
            and bounded; for all things leisure and rest come fairly then.
            <br>&emsp;Foremost of my insights is that we ought not so callously leave. For we must find ourselves
            anew,
            and in turn, leave that which had been developed. Being here in Pitt Meadows, I see much promise and
            delight. The position is solid, and one which is a lighter kind of simplicity. There are people at work
            as
            well as fair priced yoga to go to. All things far and abound, as I see it, come to know more fruition if
            you
            are here or somewhere else. "And so the big city is not so especially fine."
            <br>&emsp;When I think of my life, I see a stream of marvel movies, some income to spend on newer games;
            nor
            any lacking when it comes to backlogs or classics. My studies remain pointed, as are our scenic
            learnings a
            bit broader then they were for much time ago. Our health is in balance, and of the ways we can improve,
            so
            is this relatively clear and deliberate, or sprouting through time. Food is always tricky; for I am
            somewhat
            begrieved to lack the friends and fun that give me ease to indulge. But there is still plenty of satiety
            in
            the wholer foods. And, honestly, my biggest complaint regarding such, is the inconstancy in which we
            eat.
            For I end up being hungry and whithered. We knwo that oranges, kale and nuts are a staple; as are
            smoothies.
            If money was tight, banans would still be fine, paired with cranberries and roughage. Grains remain
            true,
            though the lack of sugar brings with it less to look forward to; along with take out food. Popcorn,
            potatoes
            and bread remain satisfying, but only as they come; rather than on approach.
            <br>&emsp;This is our life. None of it remarks something large or bound ahead; or anything stretching
            the
            distance. But it is hear, and considering our rythm with work and home, so do these things fill our
            current
            set. That's how I see it. There is room to inquire and reflect about the mountains and sky. As do I
            continue
            to plunder the peace from reading. Our writing patters on too. Our days could be more even; as we do
            have
            things to do; and when they are done, more will more than likely come. And so, when we are upon an
            attendance, then our balance of inside, on the porch, walking, scootering and or seeing around, can be
            more
            quiet; and not so forced out as can occur. Let us use the littlest of things to make our day special,
            and
            retain our openess as to bring more life in. Be it Yoga, playing Minecraft with Tristan; or our more
            tastefull use of porn. There is room for me to be, if we exist in the limit of exhibiting so
            immediatley.
            "At least, not with a care for abscence, as our simplciity can permitt. Not with too much haste, as to
            finish things, but to work on them, and let them become done. We can find pleasure and goods around
            this;
            and upon a dip, even out, move as this quite time affords you, or spurrs you at least: and more interest
            will come."
            <br>&emsp;We may reflect and or experience more in the time; and be it near or far, or by reason and
            gait,
            see more.

            One of the oddities of simplicity, is that it often comes through various forms. One may need 10$ worth
            of
            things, and we'll say this is a little amount; and they may have 20. And so their of excess, but not
            with a
            need for it; they may spend a bit more, for some extra fruit here or there. But one with the same needs,
            but
            only holding that amount, is equally satiated, but perhaps lacks any fair room for sprinkles and icing
            around. Other folk may fall short of what they need, only having 8 or 9. They too lack sprinkles, but
            also a
            means for content regarding their means.
            <br>&emsp;Right now, if we have room for sprinkles, then we ought use it. My hesitance to this is that
            we
            are living outside our means, and in some way, loosing strenght upon a situation that was not so
            fruitfell.
            Concilliating this is bearing me trouble.
            <br>&emsp;My experience upon meeting our needs, is that there is never much struggle in doing so. That,
            and
            you may find room for frugal delights, giving the same feeling of excess. Moreover, if we are at a
            certain
            level, be it sufficeint or not, then our actions are only more clear; for they cannot go elsewhere. And
            the
            task, or at least slant of our amends, is one of acceptence and humility. For we may wish for more, and
            work
            for that as such; or let fortune bear her place. But we may also delight in what we have, and as it out
            of
            strenght, find more grace and composure in our level'd simplciity. Whereas now, where we are stable and
            fine, yet with some excess, might we actually use that. It would be poor form if your use was
            inpractical,
            in that it removed you from your neccessities, 'causing a raise of it'. And equally, to your manor of
            living. For simplicity relishes the acitivty which it is given room and time to indulge in. "If a saint
            is
            given a fortune, he may use it; but not to the extent that it erodes his sainthood."

            I believe we underestimat the requirments when it comes to working out.
            <br>&emsp;For starters, we work out by natural circumstance. For our muscles are made and happy to be
            moving, under some sort of load, periodically at least. And our modern, if not contemporary ways, are
            such
            as to require less of us; in that we sit on soft sofas, softer beds, and otherwise lift little less were
            employed to do so; and if we do, the motions are more naughing and full of garulity, rather than an
            primitve
            motions such as walking far, running quick.
            <br>&emsp;And so, of our life and it's way, we address the fact that our muscles, in being what they
            are,
            are served by the motions we do; and on the balance of it, so do we make up for this in arbitary ways
            ---based on the manner in which it's lacking.
            <br>&emsp;There are two points of working out: form and tender. The tension of your muscles, firmnes and
            or
            strenght, comes from doing anything under load. Running achieves this nicely, as will your employments
            do
            this. This differs from though, in that this is about certain motions done repetitively, such as puhsups
            or
            squats. These aim at forming your muscles as correspond to certain kinds of movements: leg or hip
            extension,
            torso flexion etc.
            <br>&emsp;Generally, if your doing some sort of loaded movement, and your body is more or less firm,
            then
            you'll want protein, water and food. If your form is put under load, this requires stretching, as your
            resting position can bend you awkwardly; especially if your motions are stiffer, causes more contrast.
            If it
            is mere gusto you've produced, then simply recovery will do; as you haven't pushed yourself particular
            motions, 'which ought be ironed out, as to sit naturally with you', nor is your jerkiness through work
            (for
            instance an issue), as the motionsare by nature unconctrated, and only the more systematicaly fatiguing,
            rather than struutrally forming. By this, resting the muscles and returnig to neutral stance is
            sufficient.
            <br>&emsp;In any case, the point is that there is much to deal with if your doing the formative motions.
            I'd
            add, as I ought to have before, that we do such things for the composure it bears. At any rate, what we
            do
            upon such training is what we've been underestimating, in namely the amount of protein required, the
            formative recovery, and general rest and ease which such efforts bring. For we sit on the floor for the
            gain
            of constant and breezy firmness. But, via our employment and lack of vitality when it come's to
            formative
            strenght, our motions there can be a bit lugging; by the nature of being so firm all the time, 'however
            naturally plump and soft', that even if our workouts were equally light and hearty, so would our
            everyday
            nature on the floor require definite 'incorpative effort'. For we bundle up, bear down, and loose the
            rigor
            which we seek.
            <br>&emsp;In this regard, what we need is to respect the amount of work were doing. Beginning with a
            proper
            sense of how much you've done; be it overall, or following a single session. You know, in the latter's
            case,
            that you need to eat your fruit and energy sooner than later. That, and you need to do some sort of
            stretch;
            be it chest, shoulders, twists, lifts (for elongation). The issue is not so much that you'd work on
            something, or play something, or gander about; but that you'd forog those important measures; and
            sometimes,
            at the detriment of those others things, who upon such forgoance, weighs you down even more. "As things
            don't sink in properly." Plus, if you consider how you are in general, which in combination with work,
            recent sessions, and how you've progressed over the recent time, you may feel need for more naps, more
            protein, fruit, recovery, some project to finish, a need of decompressing and or relief. Just have this
            broader sense

            I do not know where this reserve of mine lasts. For it is not so much a call to duty, which I whole
            heartedly amend and superced; but something which says, 'do this, and you 'll feel free, for there will
            be
            nothing left to do: and leisure is your claim'.
            <br>&emsp;This is the difference; not a hurdle in the way of something, but something to simply step
            above,
            as not to feel; and by virtue of the reason of such task, earn a just stability, of having overcome: and
            completed it, while feeling little: to which, of the good it provides, 'for which the reason it is made
            on',
            so are you given, upon having received what you partook in, and thus, through such stability, 'of whihc
            you
            feel the weight no more', you happily see. This is the path of liberty, fecundity and grace. Worth a
            god's
            fate.
            <br>&emsp;OUr issue, as a man, whos been a boy, and not stopped being so, is how we live outside this
            primary path. For we may hide our motives and cares, or feel drawn to far off things; which may not be
            bad
            in themselves, but from our squirming point of view, are not so good for me: as I don't rightly seek it.
            "And I fetter so much, because we always bear more upon that line of stability: yet find it even harder
            to
            be open: as the truth is ever so hard to explain." I've noticed though, as I actually live well, 'by the
            effect of accepting this path, and ceasing the wants and fears', that we find it much clearer and simple
            to
            share, and thus be open. "To whits and ends seperate of our ways, but congruent, as plain things are: or
            maybe connection of said points. Both may be."

            The ocean of my mind seems to have more water now; and the waves are only the larger. Unlike before,
            where
            our esscence was rather compact, 'and noticeable of small cracks', now the tides wash right over it.
            This
            does not remove it mind you, 'but we've enough natural momentum to flow past it, and onto something
            else'.
            <br>&emsp;Ironically, we have had some pizza and chocolate, and so our sights on things is a bit hazed.
            <br>&emsp;But I recognize in my heart, that what I care about is eating well, exercising right, the
            language
            arts, and the outdoors. I've always loved gaming and playing with friends; and movies, and as of late
            youtube, is a general delight.
            <br>&emsp;This kind of life though flourishes on it's ability to partake in things. And thus, even with
            less
            room for expenditure, a laborous job is more ideal. Especially when it is one where you work on a team.
            <br>&emsp;Now, some labor is more preferable than others; for me at least, as one who means to be active
            outside of work. In simplest terms, there is smooth and jerky labor; one reflecting construction like
            jobs,
            the other, personal shopping. A cashier for instance is it's own sort, or at least has it's own
            properties;
            unqiue as most. But, in more similar terms, is a produce associate, or clerk, who spend their time
            working
            with others, moving around; but admittedly with a bit of jerk.
            <br>&emsp;Personal shopping may simply be a contemporary advent; and if it weren't here, I'm sure we'd
            find
            something else. But for now, as it is common place, 'as cashiers once became', that so are we inclined
            to
            work there.
            <br>&emsp;We have full autonomy when it comes to this decision. If there is a war, however likely or
            not,
            then my current position will be of a civilian. If I am called, I may keep reserved, and offer to help
            with
            something else. If conscription comes to pass, so be it. We'll lay down our lives and die. Perhpas,
            through
            potential gluttony and pain, we'll cherrish and prostrate those bound to something similar.
            <br>&emsp;Economically, we are all on our own. And we may be well off and fortuned, 'or set at the back
            of
            the pack'. What we value though is for us to decide; or at least accept. For me, I place much of my
            worth in
            things, and our according means to them, through a principle lens; one which sees no abscence of fortune
            or
            oppertunity as a slight upon me; even if there is: as we are fine with little as it is.
            <br>&emsp;As such, economics reflects the limit of good in our lives. While war sparks the possibility
            of
            bad. "There may be crime and illness in our common lives, but so is war an investement of pestulance, as
            for
            better grounds to come anew." If this is our end, so be it; we'll partake in it as we must do. If not,
            then
            my duty is to myself, my family, and those I attend to.
            <br>&emsp;I cannot speak to the nature of a constitution, the legacy of streets and bread, and the way
            our
            culutre is alike. So I do not know the reason or place there is for one to be so publicly invovled. Even
            if
            they helped them through whichever state the world was, so is such education for economics; or for the
            various accounts of our lives.
            <br>&emsp;This is from me though, and not something which is fostered upon me as something neccessary.
            "Mos
            of what I've heard, or percieved to been said( to me), is in regards to the improvement I can make for
            myself." As it comes to children, most advice seems banked on that. But I desire this little. We are
            already
            so filled by life and it's grandeur. I do want more, 'be it in a good mind or not', but it is simply
            broader, in education, ideas, curiosity, generous fun. A child feels like a compact diamond. I already
            have
            a pearl inside, and thus care only for the ocean of gold around. "For that diamond requires strict
            concentration, in love and mining. In bearing it at least."
            <br>&emsp;These thoughts are mine, as are our sympathies, 'as we ponder over a dense or broad way of
            living:
            but of me not less'. The life I am living and care for, is one of creation, one which the sun is
            gratefull
            for shining, 'as she feels seen'; and to all her neighbourly delights. The strenght in this way is one
            of
            real admission, 'that the goods we seek, in local wonders or far off love', require the same manner of
            committment and practice as other paths of life would. Only, we mellow a bit in this form of life, as it
            is
            our own. And only from our sinking into it, have we accepted the peace in this, 'and color around',
            along
            with the whisps of wind born of lands far and around; the sort of scents and hazy imagery that sees me
            settled and kept, but also cheerfull and delight as to whats to come. "Across the sea lies a place for
            me,
            to further be; not somewhere for committment, but for our current resolve to blossom."

            I'd like to describe experience as a sort of sphere; the surface area of it at leasat, where there are
            splotches and strands of color, and also roughness, 'like the top of the sea'.
            <br>&emsp;Why I don't like certain foods, certain tv shows, certain media and or consumption, is that it
            blocks out certain parts of the sphere. When it comes to evil things, 'like amputation and butchery',
            all I
            see are those harsh reds, 'and the rough and tumbly mountains'; but I loose sight of the man or woman
            experiencing such. "The indian ocean of their heart is gone." Equally, in fine things, or pleasing one's
            at

            For

            accomodate

            So we've been given this assignment: speak to the months and years ahead.
            <br>&emsp;For starters, the further we look out, the more of an aim I need. Of this, I don't have. I
            want
            children, but don't desire them. "Eventually, we'll say, but nothing more." I care little for a house,
            have
            no genuine care for travel. And, as regards children, as certain as I'd need more (in income, to
            provide),
            that so is this threshold relative to me and my simple standards. Whatever this amounts to, I cannot
            say.
            But I'd say it's years down the line, and the stakes are (to me) moderate. "I mean to raise someone to
            live
            well; and this does not require as much money as is needed to be more well off." So I have no
            apprehension
            about this down the line.
            <br>&emsp;I say this, because my interests now are not in the way that a career is. As that is a sort of
            mean, 'a profession, or basis for further income, to acquire things, or do what you like'. Little of
            what I
            care for benefits from this. And even if it does, 'as I would find much pleasure in seeing the wilds of
            India', so is this expensive, and as such, demanding of my time to afford it. "I would love to be King
            of
            England; but considering the amount of effort, I don't care enough for the reward." Plus, the nature of
            my
            interests, which can be summized into gaming, writing and the outdoors, is that nearly all forms of work
            take away from my ability to engage with them. So far as my cares are of concern, and I have no desire
            nor
            apprehension about the future to come, then the simplest means to live is what I seek. If I had no need
            for
            anything, 'and had some innate means for home and bread', I'd still employ myself; as being around
            people
            has it's own benefits and comfort. Little more.
            <br>&emsp;On that note, be it for interest or preperation, the kind of jobs/careers I'd apply myself
            towards
            is slanted away from non-social positions. I see the benefit of working from home, but it give's you no
            collegues or friends. My feelings will change about this as time goes on, but right now, considering the
            long time I spent alone (before moving), being around other's seems preferable, if not essential.
            <br>&emsp;I say all of this, because, whether I was given something from you or some other fortune, I'd
            use
            it. But not for any meaningfull end. I'd vacation, relax and explore; but the point I'm at now, aimless
            and
            pondering, would still be reached. So I don't long for you or anyone to give me anything. It would just
            be
            temporary pleasantry.
            <br>&emsp;Practically, I mean to stay for at least 6 months (as you put it). I can imagine staying
            longer,
            perhaps 2 years. But I'd imagine by that point an urge to move would start simmering. I mean to stay at
            Superstore throughout this time; and whether you moved or I did, I'd give some thought to staying in
            Ridge/Pitt, and remaining at Superstore.
            <br>&emsp;Vancouver always felt like a dream, because it offered a seemingly easier route to the things
            I
            longed for. Girls, friends, recognition. But I know now, clearly, that these things come purely from
            your
            own actions; and simple ones at that. Moreso, these actions are not limited by any location; nor that
            benefited from any. There are more people in Vancouver, as are there more buisnesses and things going
            on.
            But if I do little, it won't matter. And I am finding that if I do even little, that this is enough: and
            all
            places (including Pitt Meadows) are then suitable.
            <br>&emsp;I can say, with great purpose, that I mean to do better, as a person, and perhaps, a man. I
            wish
            to recycle; learn how and why, and share this with others. I want to be more involved publicly: which
            being
            on Twitter or Facebook in any meeaningfull sense is. Be it for pleasure or purpose, I love video --of
            the
            youtube sort. And I would like to use such means/platform to speak about the things I care about
            ---about
            the games I love, or the world.

            This has been my genuine interest for the recent years. But a mix of ignorance and procastination has
            held
            me back. I have a mountain of heart and substance, and my skills have gone through various tests; but
            the
            idea of starting goes beyond me. In part, because I know what it takes.
            <br>&emsp;$$$$But also, because my deepest care for these things is not zeal or 'childish idealism'; but
            real and genuine care. "Something I'd be pleased with, even if no one heard or saw. The very act of
            trying
            would be enough." But of what is enough, so do I have old thoughts and excuses regarding the need for
            success,'and how the attempt we'd make would not yield us such'. This lowers our excitment, and makes me
            feel isolated: as I imagine that no one cares about what were doing, or even condemns me for it.
            <br>&emsp;"Get a real job!" is the sentiment I hear --within my angst.

            I say all of this, because there is one clear truth: if I am well, happy and pleased, then I care not if
            my
            aims are promising, or that exciting. I can just do them out of our care and interest, and not feel like
            we
            have to prove anything; or that it has to literally change the world. I just want to be better --in an
            active sense. But what I'd define that as, and imagine it to be in the sense of production and
            creativity,
            is genuinely large. As I have so many cares and delights, so much insight and knowledge, so much value
            and

            $$$The honest truth, is that I believe that people are their own entities, and experience things in ways
            that we more often than not pithily imagine. "We know so little aboout ourselves, yet we claim to
            understand
            people: and grossly praise or pillary them."
            <br>&emsp;What I lack is happiness; and it is because I am not living right, full or anything truly. And
            it
            is not the effects upon others which I care about; but that we are acting well, behaving kindly, and not
            so
            juvenile or passive. "If I were otherwise, I'd have nothing to say; and my note would be a mere account
            of
            all the good I wish to continue. But there is in fact that part of me which is young, dumb and not
            living. I
            wish to rid this gross feeling it gives me: and all the arrogance and stupidity which it conjurs, 'as if
            some defensive mechanism or assertion to deal with such !!!!!grundge'. I don't believe my lies anymore,
            when
            I say that I am actually well. There is so much more I could do, so much happiness to gleam. But it is
            not
            about where I go or what I recieve, but how I'm being."
            <br>&emsp;Personally, I am pretty swell in these regards, flourishing even. But the world gets spat upon
            me
            sometimes. Fairly, but also crumbily, 'through the press and tv'. And I can't help but feel right and
            pleased to attend to that. At the very least, my inner happiness, 'in all its fun and wholesome
            strides',
            would reach farther. In those bounds and all the strenght needed, is what I am talking about, and feel
            mentally cloitered and repressed

            So this may be obsucre, but considering what I wrote intially, I'm confident this will lead to something
            clear.
            <br>&emsp;I find, whether I'm writing to you, or myself even, that I always end up trying to
            explain/justrfiy why being happy is important. Having things or going places does not define this for
            me,
            but how you actually spend your time; how you live.
            <br>&emsp;The issue, is that living is hard. It is not brought on by the removal of problems; this only
            gives free time. You have to then use it; nor are things of much worth withotu their own preperations.
            "You
            must learn to paint before you can do it, even if your free to do so."
            <br>&emsp;There's two sides of my life then: my dear cares, and my broader efforts in the world. The
            former
            amounts to gaming, writing and the outdoors. The latter is best summized like this (as a general
            example: I
            wish to recycle more, learn why and how, and share with people my committment to this, and also educate
            them
            as to why and how they can similarly act. Describing the motive for this, to be a good citizen, to help
            others, to be more invovled in the world, is nothing but a medley of rightousness, passion and fear.
            There
            is interest though; as a science teacher may find.
            <br>&emsp;Beyond my common living and cares, my broader interests lie in this.

            I'm looking to get my red cross.
            <br>&emsp;This is not the mark of a boy, or someone eager and young; but someone tenured and bound;
            someone
            settled, fit and mature. A man.

            make
            sway and live commiseratley within our common lives. The leaders, delegates, ministers of the world.
            Those

            <br>&emsp;I've been reading the memoir of the British minister of munitions, during world war 1. And
            this
            book ought have a iron seal to it; for it is for those keen on the workings of men. Indeed, I notice our

            So little men ruin this world. Not because of their power, but by those inflicted by their words. "The
            other
            little men."
            <br>&emsp;The Red Cross aims at wheening this off of us; which is to say, that their words will no
            longer
            seep into us, causing irritation and doubt: for our own views are already placed. "THe might of this
            quest
            lies in the resolve to inquiry; and, in maintinag composure amidst words and suggestio, ought you know
            enough to be so undecided, yet above said words."
            <br>&emsp;For me, this route is upheld by nothing but our view of it, and the small measures that
            faciliate
            movement. A man may do as he please; and by that, progress as he would. For me, sitting on the floor is
            the
            most vitalizing choice he can make. But so must he properly amend. For being on the floor, by it's
            nature,
            brings one to breathe, and by that, remain ample and strong; and through that, brim and thoughtfull. But
            this breathe, which procures such good, is merely apart of position (on the floor), and comes naturally.
            But, certain decisions may render this mute; namely foods comparable to pizza and inordiante amounts of
            sugar --espeically those, in small amounts even, of choclately comparison. These cease your ability to
            deeply breathe; and naturally, as one does during yoga, or while on the floor. And this creates a sort
            of
            stricken posture; partially on the floor, as it is not so upright on it's own, but through the breathe
            and
            it's elevation of your gait --or natural lift. When this goes, and your on the floor --out of devotion--
            your torso bears the load, and through harsh fortuity. This makes our orbiting efforts more brazen, in
            that
            they move from stricdken grounds; and these causes further wear on our frame. The result may be that you
            do
            less; which is poor for leisrue and producitivy; but also your system, as your congurency for food
            lessens,
            along with more stabilizing and resotrative motions; which bear much solidity and grace to your sleep
            and
            employment.

            So I had this weird thought. Based on what I was saying earlier, I'd describe my 'angst and need for
            validation' as coming from the fact that I write so much, and thus have so much to say; but feel if I
            just
            said what I mean in short, that it would seem weird, and be put down. From writing so much, what I have
            to
            say is quite original. And because it is so different, I am not secure (or without any rooted fear
            below),
            as to just say it as it is. As such, I say more than I need to, as part of me feels like I need to be

            So we are liberty to do as you please. I get swept up sometimes in the winds of the world; but so is
            this
            via a format. In more deep and deliberate forms, 'the impressions from such', we actually see the world
            bigger, and feel our efforts small.
            <br>&emsp;I cannot help but take a present measure, and let our actions build from the grounds which we
            then
            set. Nothing seems of worth otherwise. There is not prevailing condition or pedigree; and it seems more
            and
            more that no one cares. Our lives are just full of tension and services; goods and expectation. And
            there is
            little for me to say regarding that which is, in fact, a result of a lapse in our measure.
            <br>&emsp;For when were in that, we just see, soft and plainly. It never feels like we need to be
            somewhere,
            or have something set in mind. We already moving, calm and set. But, something is sprouting, coming to
            be by
            our prescence in seeing it. It comes about, slightly every day.
            <br>&emsp;For the point in life is that all things great and meaningfull are beyond your common rythm.
            In
            truth, things of the former sort just draw you more; but are not so different in the actions they
            produce.
            "It is by their worth and appeal that you do more, which is what we seek." But we still do things of the
            sort now; but without such a draw and passion as born of such mighty gleam.
            <br>&emsp;I constantly refure the norm, or what is esteemed as gossiple and truth; or so clever and
            wise.
            And I do this, because were on our own. The tenure of such is brought by our undying self-regard; and
            our
            lack of direction and or resovle as born from a lapse of this. We are, in employment and propiety,
            stable
            and flowing, moving and steady. And from here, dreams of impact and production arrise, 'but on a stream
            of
            merriment and strenght; a sort of flourishing path, or state within such, that is not drawn to but see,
            and
            meet it'. There isn't this oppertunity or condition which drags me out of our state. For, in irony, we
            may
            amend based on what we see, 'but it amounts to direction, or application rather,' as being within our
            state,
            we never cease, and merely ordain our efforts to faciliate an accompanying creation ---ontop of our more
            known amends, to this novel one seen.
            <br>&emsp;I admitt nothing when it comes to the values and principle I believe. These have come from
            years
            of hard panging effort; an enormous amount of solitude, potential contraiety in our aversion to all
            common
            goods, and an otherwise reconcilable disdain for those moments that we do slouch, 'and feel like were
            misguided and wrong'. It is only our lapse from the truest self. The one which needs to goal or
            objective,
            because our being is enough. I need no such aim for work, nor family and delight. It is only those
            things
            which begin to sparkle around these, upon our little measure slipping, 'and these near things fading
            away;
            upon which foregin affairs and youtfull grandeur shine'. Are we not already focused and arranged? Is it
            not
            enough to return to these; or better put, to our meausure, as to lift above these nearest things, 'and
            from
            there, truly see the stars: but not from our focus being absent, and all things pithily viewed and or
            sought

            I can tell were a little bothered by things; and namely because of our state, and the prescence of
            something
            to deal with.
            <br>&emsp;Our finances have not been so fine compared to recent years. My admissions to forutne are one
            thing. But in practice, we are making several hundred dollars every two weeks, have removed our debts,
            and
            are more or less on the upwind of income. Our total rests near 2500, with many months to likely come. I
            see
            us getting another scooter, for about 500, and our computer is in not dire need for repair. It has been
            fine
            for so long; and the sound of it is not even that bothersome. "When I think of starting new games
            though, I
            despair."
            <br>&emsp;But our current scooter is an issue. The back tire is becoming a point of concern. I've orderd
            glue and new strips; as we had to replace the old one a few days ago ---which had lasted several months.
            This one did not last a few days. As it were, we had to really jam it in there, and it came out several
            times. I don't feel it was a strong plug. This may entirely be due to the nature of the whole; but the
            strip
            itself, being the last from a year ago, is not exactly sticky, and so more easily brought nout. Plus, we
            had
            no glue --though I don't think this contribtued to it not staying in.
            <br>&emsp;I will try to plug the whole, and if it seems secure, then good. We have purchased a
            replacement
            tire, for about 40$, and will likely have to pay the same for it to be installed. This cannot be done
            till
            the following Monday. "Note that the path by veras is covered in glace; odd, but do take pause, and go
            to
            the side."
            <br>&emsp;If for whatever reason this tire cannot be replaced, then we will buy a new one. As far as I'm
            concerned, our money is made as a source for utility and potential moving. Beyond our fortune and
            support,
            we are above the threshold in which this can occur. I do not see us leaving during the summer, and so
            more
            will be saved. And my PC is more or less fine, and in all fairness, ripe for a winter upgrade.
            Battlefield
            and or GTA are coming out, but these are on playstation. And Avowed and Red Dead are fine for the PC
            now. As
            has Civ been near excellent. Ark 2 perhaps will prove me wrong; but it is nowhere to be seen. "And to
            interject, but playing BF, Diabloe and Ark with Matt has been great, and some Minecraft with Tristan
            also. I
            really feel we are holding ourselves back, in the farthest and simplest of ways."
            <br>&emsp;Right now, we have 1300$ cash in our TD savings, plus 500 in the TFSA, and the middling AMC.
            We
            have just over 900$ in our Coast Capital ---plus a meeting to iron out passwords and cards, after work
            on
            tuesday. We have 50$ on our credit card. These are our funds.
            <br>&emsp;By our need, and the means to properly allocate it by the virtue of immediacy, 'and our
            pleasure
            in doing so based on the rythm were in now', I am affording you the tire and repair which you've already
            placed, plus the earphones --whihc albeit icky, is but an offering to the benevolent gods. I am not
            condoning a new scooter purchase ---though I do see a nice on, Jaison, which, like the rest, is 32 km/h,
            360vh, solid tires; yet it is of good make, solid platform, rear suspension, and a bit more power for
            slopes. It is 450 with tax. But of no need now. Worse case scenario, is we walk to work on Tuesday and
            Thursday; we have a single shift on the following tuesday, 6-230 (an oddity which is been set to not
            repeat). We can walk the neighbourhood --which we don't do enough--- use our parents tendancy to shop,
            and
            our means to go to Langley Market, or Sev for bananas. We may also drive on occasion. Then, we can put
            our
            mat on the deck, and sit there for the morning, day and dusk. We ought do this more anyway! It's there
            at
            least. "And I do find, that by natural inclindation, we go on our scooter; but without this sense that
            were
            missing or in need: just as we please. It is also in part because we could message Matt to play a game.
            I
            feel relatively strong that we are not avoiding him, or in need to constantly say hello. As far as I
            know,
            he is at home playing games, and will be there if I ask him to. There is no reason to exepect he is
            dead, or
            upset with you and turning his head, if you do not play with him everyday. Were good."

            So, our deed as a ruler, be it of the mayans or maurya: what are we to do?
            <br>&emsp;Well, for one, you have your adaptive elements; where you plan for settlments and conquest
            based
            on the land and neighbours you have. If there's natural wonders, clusters of important resources, some
            sort
            of esteemed terrain.
            <br>&emsp;But then you have tbe laws of nature: legacy paths. These are unmitigable; and albeit
            responded to
            in an adaptive sense, they are not things which you can avoid or alter; at least, you can at most ignore
            them, but then loose their oppertunity.
            <br>&emsp;The first thing, is that antiquity military golden ages are useless. You get 1 infantry per
            conquered settlement. This would not be of interest to me if you took 10: as you may eventually build
            these
            in a few turns in your cities; nor do you start with too few units going into exploration. What is good
            in
            the military tree is a +2 settlement limit. You need 9 points, 2 coming for every conquered settlement.
            I
            tend to say, settle 4 or 5 of your own, and take 3 to 2 (respectively) of another. You may assess this
            based
            on who your neigbour is, where their placed, the ease of their defenses, along with the timing of your
            available offense.
            <br>&emsp;Science and culuter operate similarly, giving a golden age version of their +4 base yield
            building, and +1 per adj. resource or mountain (resp.). Science is more or less easier to reach, as you
            need
            only have enough science to get codexes throughout the tree; while culture requires 7 wonders, and this
            is a
            very competative and prioritizing path. I lean more towards the culture, as I value the early boost to
            exploration civics. But you may counterbalance this by investing into the culture attributes. "As
            culture
            tends to die off once theolgoy and unique civics are researched. And the only race is to the first piety
            civic, and, somewhat, to El Escorial. While science retains its utility throughout the age, for units
            and
            mastery buffs." It's also worth noting, that if there are no mountains, you may still benefit from
            amphitheaters, as 5 cities with a base of 4 is still a solid boost of 20. You will certainly have 7
            wonders,
            which will give a few points, and your bound to have a mountain or two which some of your theatres will
            be
            adj. too; and so the expected boost is at least 25. So work for this as you will; but not with hesitance
            to
            it's worth, but rather your means of accomplishing it. Gate of Nations is essential, and not so
            competative.
            Dur-Shurakin, alebit moderatley useful, come's a bit sooner and is quicker to go; but if your initial
            settlers are out, don't fret about making it. "Considering your pressing goal is to reach 7 wonders
            total."
            Emile Belle is usefull, though if you get the diplo point for your first suzerain, then it's not
            essential.
            But not so competative. "A great second city build." Weiyang, aleit extremely competative, is
            particularly
            good, as it aids you in future suzerain acquisition. It requires grassland though; which may limit your
            competitors. The lower tree ---terracota and theodoric-- are unreachable; but thsu oppertune for you to
            move
            ahead to the end/top of the tree. Oracle and Colosseum are the least competative I find. Nalanda is most
            competative; but, from their monks mound becomes fought for and later colossus; while Angkor watt
            generally
            gets left behind. The science tree holds little worth, besides Pyramid of the Sun; but without
            emphasizing
            science it is tricky to get. The proper approach is, prioritize Gate of Nations, Weiyang and Angkor.
            Build
            Emille if you can, and rest easy on Oracle and Colosseum; they are seldom built until Theodric is done.
            The
            point is, if wonders is your aim, then go through your needed motions, of settling, core buildings,
            military
            etc. and build the wonders as they come; prioritiy one's ought have the prior neccessities established
            for
            them to be made; while less needed one's can be held off till your empire is solid, and then you make
            it.
            There is often points in the mid game that have this oppertunity.

            I can't quite recall what I meant to say. Something along the lines of exercise; but also another.
            <br>&emsp;For the first, we need but do what is good for the moment; but must, and surely as we've
            enstated
            for stretching and eating enough, do some sort of exercise. The point being that if it be free range,
            full
            range, mixed and or shouldered by running, through soft, concentrated or a circuit sort, that you do it.
            Some days need this little, or have room for it if you see fit. Sometimes you may wish to squeeze
            something
            in; big or small. And others, you may see worth in neglect; as it is not so precocious not to exercise;
            but
            the future is then laid for you to wholly remain, so that when the time is better, you do exericse. "As
            the
            one lesson of exercise, is that it amounts to little, but pays you alot to do so; and conversely, if it
            is
            not done at all, then all things fail." It is like the ease in which things are dictated by gravity; yet
            if
            she ceases, all things go astray.

            So I am a man, and for the most part up to par with what that means. But I concede to a bit of aversion
            to
            effort, or at least 'embracing struggle'. I tend to make choices which overt me from this; or at least
            direct me as not to go such way. And for the most part this is fine; as my curiosity and delight is not
            engendered by stress or grough.
            <br>&emsp;Sometimes though, it clearly seems that our way is one which is upheld and 'engendered' souly
            by
            us. And in that, as I slip, 'I am left alone, pitiable, ashamed, and full of swallow'.
            <br>&emsp;Alas, there is a difference between running away from right and wrong, and simply being well
            off
            enough to turn your head for a moment; and then enjoying yourself, or living at least, as if that moment
            is
            not burdened by such effort. I know, that our need for effort is clear, and so when were in harmony with
            that, all is well.
            <br>&emsp;So, in these lingering thoughts, I fall on the mention of exercise. It seems that, akin to one
            pure stretch, that some mere knee raises will do. You can pair this nicely prior to leaving for the
            fields,
            by doing said marches; and perhaps, if richness guides you, with a few pushups as well.
            <br>&emsp;I would like to sit here and berate the fact that you must scooter to the decent fields. But,
            for
            one, going back is no issue, as you can sit, stretch your legs and what not. Also, you may do a quick
            yoga
            session, and later on stretch your shoulders and back. "Considering the recent session, in all its
            absent
            roots, so were such stretches fine." Moreover, you can likely smooth into your session, even from a
            scooter,
            upon a prior march, as this will lighten you up. You could see if doing it directly before was ample;
            but
            even during your second walk, or some prior point. Even some pushups here would do. And you may jusy go
            to
            the field, and do the simplest things there. Pullups and squats are best when garnished. Though they may
            be
            done more reguarly

            I had this thought for some time, that our need to declare a path was a remark of our shortcomings; in
            that,
            from them, we were still, idle, wishing; and thus we sought for an aim which would bear promise, and
            through
            that, remedy our inaction.
            <br>&emsp;This seems ever more true now. I can't quite say how we've been thinking about it, but this
            idea
            'of a path', is one which doesn't resignate with me anymore.
            <br>&emsp;I mean to say, in our loose words, that why we feel this is so, is from a notion which, albeit
            spoken recently, is not so clear. It has to do, or at least falls along the lines not doing things
            right, as
            evidence by your need for clarity, but therein, 'as if being brought by an aim', we seek such a point
            which
            would draw us to act so rightly, and seemingly remedy our state. Only, I'd say the honest reflection is
            that
            one ought deal with the result of their action, assess the cause, and more ordinately adjust. "For we
            end up
            mending our feelings of the current error, rather than letting the solution pan out."
            <br>&emsp;I see that our trouble is one of task. As we are well set and equiped to do as we deem fit;
            but
            are rather thrown by the remedial nature of it; particualry, as it cowers under the glare of our primary
            duties. My resolve then is to fortify such tasks as not to be so thrown; so that we may adpat under
            load,
            and otherwise be more regulary stout, and propulsive.
            <br>&emsp;The two elements of this are food and training. One is to do with whole foods, their
            preperation,
            and the avoidance of processed (and expensive) meals, nor any intruding indulgences: all which come when
            our
            stores and prep fall short, and give way to some other means to eat --as this is itslef neccessary, and
            a
            point of hinderance (as we become famished). Exercise is similar, in that if we have the basis for it
            set,
            we tend to do so in harmony with our work, off time and everyday rythm. We have found great benefit in
            developing long from routines, but are lacking short ones. The point of the former is that, following
            rough
            days or bouts of hard work, you may need more guidance to train. But, on good days, or those where our
            rythm
            is of a frequent sort [smaller yet many bouts], we'd benefit from equally smaller sessions. In all
            things,
            training, in the sense of practice via guidance, ingrains us with firmer sorts of the motions we do 'off
            the
            cuff', and thus through our day to day rythms. We have this from our life so far, but many potential
            sides
            are off, and not so engrained. The long form is good, but the short form is a needed addition.

            It pays one no deficit to have ppor thoughts. "They merely trinkle on."
            <br>&emsp;You may say then, 'what about good ones, don't they drip similarly?'. And I'd say,
            confidently,
            that thoughts which are good, so much as they are not bad, are so, as to be of a form which is made by
            an
            act, which, in being acted, makes the result good. "In the way, that telling the truth makes a statement
            solid: not by what the statement is, but that it was spoken truly."
            <br>&emsp;In this way, when we form our thoughts, helm them, spurr them with fidelity and care, the ends
            are
            good in as much as such qualities -- in which their brought to be--- are fair.
            <br>&emsp;It is not an unimportant point to state, that this does not strictly mean that the contents of
            such thoughts are deemed just based (more or less) but the nature of the thinking which brought them
            there.
            It is merely to say, that thoughts which come about loosely and meekly flutter away, 'as a beam bolted
            weakly tends to fall'; so do thoughts born and goverend with otherwise measures (or values) of strenght,
            or
            at least qualities, which akin to the poorly bolted board, 'whereby ppor is some assumed aspect to the
            motion of the bolting', that so in the contrast of this, 'in bolting well', that well in the context of
            thinking, bears certain qualities which, in bearing thoughts, we deem such thoughts well. "For the paint
            on
            the wall or portraits hung up may be crass and cruel; while the wall itself is sturdily built." In that,
            Hitler may have had thoughts of a tremendous sort: but the ideas, or contents rather within them, were
            petulant and crude.
            <br>&emsp;What were trying to say then, or at least the distinction which our point requires, is that
            thoughts and ideas are seperate, in that one is the wall, the other the ornament.
            <br>&emsp;And so, my point, is that thoughts which are poor, 'in that they crumble' do us no harm, as it
            is
            not them which hold any idea which we act upon. Their effect may not be irrelevant, 'as we may have
            ideas
            drug down by poor foundations'; but it tends to be the objects within solid thinking that come to
            fruition.
            And I say this, for it is no cost to us to think in awkard ways: as so much as such thinking is such
            way,
            'it's contents will not come to spurr'. The benefit though, is we get in the motion of thinking, like an
            exercise. Indeed, we do want firm thoughts and ideas within to boot: but if our time is spent thinking,
            and
            to no solid avail, so be it. "For the weakness of such frame holds little which we act on: and we are
            only
            then left with the question of whether were fortuned enough to think again, 'for things which we may
            then
            act upon'."

            <br>&emsp;I do so the road ahead, and it is full of things ahead. From gods and matter, mind and stone.
            <br>&emsp;But were still in this state where were falling, and trying to oppose this through the
            elements of
            flourishing.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, we are in need of an oultine regarding food. Corn seems a solid food when paired
            with
            edmamae. Each feels a bit too much when our training is low and our needs are thinner. But, ideally,
            we'd be
            with such need, and thus of corn. Bread is similar, in that it becomes quite nice, and something
            delicate.
            <br>&emsp;Smoothies remain a staple, and thus our need of milk, flax, kale, berries and bananas.
            Cucumber
            and peanuts has become quite good, and relatively cheap. Oranges too are so good and simple.
            <br>&emsp;I think my lack of training, or consistency of it, makes the midday harder. As we struggled
            once
            in trying to fill this; and we've done so by having several smaller smoothies, and the corn and edamame
            in
            the late afternoon. But I still feel a bit famished. In part, because we are not in truth eating much;
            and
            our lack of exercise squanders what we do eat. I feel that lentils will make a welcome return; and
            perhaps
            kale also.

            <br>&emsp;For glyphs, considering we can do 45 easily, once were past glyph 25, we don't get 2 ranks,
            and
            benefit little from higher pit tiers. My feeling is if the tier is above the glyph level, the chance is
            high. So we just run as low as we can, and once we hit glyph 40, we bump it up tier 45.
            <br>&emsp;Masterworking. Rank 1 costs 100 obducite, rank 2 is 700, 3 is 5000. Nightmare dungeons give
            around
            700 at t3. For me, spend the gold to secure the the best crit, then let the 2nd one be. We should be
            able to
            be 8/12 on all our gear. For skill ranks, they get +1 midway to rank 2, and again midway to rank 3. The
            final 2 points cost the most --11 then 12--- so beyond getting everything to 8, we can still add a point
            or
            two to get the second plus to our skill.
            <br>&emsp;Greater affix gear has higher base stats and affixes. This makes the MW scale much better. We
            should farm bosses to get GA versions of all our uniques. Also, you can't go past rank 2 if it's not

            higher
            chance of being higher. We can target farm aspects through the gambler, in hope of better aspects. "40

            So just thought I'd share this with you, but for many years I've sat on the floor --and slept there too.
            It's an odd thing to do, but I feel great. Only, in the recent year or so, I've started getting these
            horrible headaches. It's not random, but occurs when I've been been exercising very little, then try and
            get
            back into things. My body struggles to adjust. I do alot of yoga (a vareity of it) normally, but doing
            so
            becomes essential in order to avoid these headaches. I did not do any yesterday, and worked out in the
            morning, and just felt terrible last night.
            <br>&emsp;D4 is pretty much saying 'fuck you' to me, computer wise. And honestly, blasting wares me out.
            I'd
            like to keep playing, but with the former being the case, I can't even look past the fact of the latter.
            I'm
            gonna keep playing for a few days, but probally back out. They do XP and loot goblin events half way
            through
            the season, so return then.
            <br>&emsp;I would love to play Ark. As far as I know, my PC says sure to that. In a bit though. I'll
            still
            play D4 till then, but maybe not as much. I'll let you know. Prbally gonna start a sinlge player game.
            Just
            need to relax and get myself ironed out.

            So, as a kid, I ran around. Like most. And I recall our first venture into soccer, on timbits. And
            things
            were par for the course. We soon entered a child's league, and played on the TREX. We were a great team,
            and
            via my speed and general skill, was a solid player.
            <br>&emsp;During elementary, we were the fastest kid in our grade. We won all school races through grade
            one
            and five. At the district races, we came 4th twice and 8th once; then, in grade 4 and 5, we went to the
            Alouette races, and came 10th and 6th.
            <br>&emsp;As the years went on, we remained atheltic, but did not excell. There were people as fast, or
            sometimes faster than me. And people began to become much stronger; as we were not a part of working
            out.
            During our highschool years, we would do bootcamps during P.E, and we'd succeed more or less. We felt
            good
            about ourselves, in the same way we did about our classes; in that we simply felt assured of our
            prowess.
            <br>&emsp;But as the latter part of highschool came, we felt a little insecure. Our size was rather
            thin,
            and our ability in soccer was rather sub-par. I did not apply myself as if I cared, but I noticed how
            unremakrable we were. We joined fitcon, and did well enough, but to not amazing end. And despite being
            skilled in soccer, our excellence was not harnessed; nor did we care to continue playing.
            <br>&emsp;During our grade 12 year, we had gone through some personal trouble. And out of the ashes, we
            committed oursleves to working out. At first we went to the gym ona whim and found ourselves acquainted
            with
            the equipment and moves. We felt quite confident in the esteemed 'monster powder', to gain weight; but
            to no
            avail. We kept on, established a generally good supplement routine; ate much better, 'in hashbrowns and
            eggs'. And by the fall, we were benching a plate, had thicker shoulders and arms, and generally felt
            strong
            and upright. This practice lost it's prominence though through the winter, but regaind an amiable pace
            through the following spring. I recall meeting someone from school during a coaching session, and how he
            remarked our size. Someone even commented on me during our graduation party, how well I looked.
            <br>&emsp;As I did graduate though, our routine diminished. Mostly out of care. And as we went through
            college, we did little. Our sensibilities may have remained, but our practice less so. During the summer
            of
            2015, we found much resolution and joy in eating wholesome. Our exercise remained somewhat absent; but
            we
            did bring it to some prominence through calisenthics. The inpracticality of this, in that we'd do it at
            home, made for much inconsistency. But, eating grains and fruit deliberatley had wonderfull effects. We
            did
            not cease eating junk, but did not do so as we did in our younger years. "On a whim, and often." I
            recall
            returning to the gym that year, in the fall, and finding much strenght and benefit. Though, albeit
            handled
            somewhat poorly, I lost the care for such; out of merrit and concern in the weight lifting (to be
            exact). As
            the new year came, we exercised moderatley, and in a mix of free-weight, weights and aerobics (including
            recreation). Generally though, our focus was on food, and not much else. "Training happened, big or
            small,
            as it did or didn't."
            <br>&emsp;Later on the year we were employed at Save-On, and we had vowed to exercise more. And there
            was
            this hesitation to do the pushup and pullups which we deemed proper. We felt that our size would be
            small.
            And there was nothing much besides this, in terms of metabolic concerns. But we did go through, and
            found
            much good in doing so. Our concerns were not met, and the benefit from free-weight took course. This is
            also
            when our yoga efforts came to prominence. "Notably, in our experience of in-house training, which has
            much
            benefit for quality and volume."

            So Diablo 4 boots up, shows the company logos, then goes to a log in screen. Initially, it would go the
            former, reboot the pc, then next time it'd go through, and 50/50 it would reboot at some main menu
            screen,
            or upon loading into the game. Also, the login screen has stuttered for some time, and often the game
            will
            freeze. There has never been reboots till recently.
            <br>&emsp;Then, I set my power settings as such: I switched the PSI power setting to 'not limited'. What
            seemed to happen then, is that the game would reboot on first launch, then be fine the second try. In
            tangent with this, I also blew out dust from all my fans. The stuttering at the login screen seemed to
            go
            away. On one occasion it did stutter and freeze. But on all other occasions went through. Unfortunately,
            be
            it a windows update or something, the reboots began happening several times in a row again. I restored
            my pc
            to the point before Diablo came out and I had made any changes, and still, a reboot. The windows updates
            seemed to have remained though.
            <br>&emsp;One of the odd things I noticed, is that when the game would not reboot, the little blue
            cursor,
            which would spin to show loading, would scale up a little (and get bigger), and when this was so, the
            game
            did not reboot. Resolution seems to have been an issue for the pc as a whole. I have been playing civ 7
            4k
            max settings for several months now; but in the midst of this, I tried it out, and as I went to change
            the
            resoltion, the game rebooted. It seems fine besides this. But I installed Ark, which I've played many
            times
            before, and as I got to the main menu, and went to settings, reboot.
            <br>&emsp;Oddly enough, upon the restore and this reboot from Diablo, upon the restart to the windows
            screen
            (where I put in my password), the pc rebooted. This has never happened --only when launching games,
            certain
            ones at least.

            So I've played Diablo 4 for years now. No problems. The only issue is that when reaching the login
            screen it
            stutters, and sometimes freezes.
            <br>&emsp;Since April 28th, upon launching the game, the pc resets. This will occur several times, then
            the
            game will go through. At the main menu, or a moment after loading into the game, reboot. Sometimes I
            will
            get to play, and there's no issue.
            <br>&emsp;Performance wise, I am playing D4 and Civ 7 4k max settings, and all is fine. But it seems as
            of
            late all is messed up. Civ still works, but I went to the settings, tried to change the resolution,
            reboot.
            <br>&emsp;So I cleaned my fans, set the PSI usage to 'no limits', and the reboot would still happen, but
            only once. It would then go through. This also removed the stuttering at the login screen. This was the
            case
            for several days. But for some reason, went back to rebooting after several launch attempts. "It is
            usually
            after the first company logo is reached, then reboot."
            <br>&emsp;I tried restoring my PC to an earlier date --prior to these happenings--- but to no avail.
            First
            attempt to launch D4, reboot. And oddly, upon it reseting to the windows screen --where I put in my
            password-- reboot. Which has never happened before.
            <br>&emsp;I am hesitant to bring this problem to you. As my experience has been that the issue is
            somewhat
            inconsistent. The fee for repair is quite large for me, and I'd hate for much time to be wasted on
            formalities, when in fact, performance wise, the PC functions great --and has been for a long time. The
            issue is from a driver, or part of windows update, or something. Which I don't imagine is easy to find.
            I am
            wondering then to the nature of your service and what it entails. What if you find no issue, am I
            charged?
            What if you find a supposed issue, fix that, but the problem persists: do I get charged to bring it back
            in?
            <br>&emsp;I will admitt that my PSU has been a candidate for issues for some time, as it seems a bit
            older,
            and the airflow to it is poor. My GPU is a 6800xt, and last year there was an issue with some games
            causing
            a power failure upon lauch --not a reboot as in the present scenario, but hard system shutdown, like
            instantly. I took it in for repairs, and the person merely set the xbox store to 'high performance', and
            the
            issue went away. All has been fine till now. I did the same thing for D4 and Battlenet, but to no avail.
            I
            am not sure what else it could be, and I only bring up that past issue, for it may be an indicator as to
            some present problem. The issue though is different, as I have in fact played the game several times
            without
            issue. It is only upon the launch, and sometimes while in the menu, or while changing settings
            (resolutions
            notably), that a reboot occurs. And always a reboot/reset mind you, while before was hard power off.

            So undervolting seemed to work. More tries will solidify this, but two launches, no issues. There was 1
            in
            fact, but the fans were off. Plus, it was only from undervolting via the automatic settings. As far as I
            know, this set it to 1125, which was what it was at before. We set it to 1050. There was also a minimum
            500
            frequency, which may have helped. The fans are well, and performance is solid. I am curious though as to
            the
            risk of undervolting, how it effects performance, what rasiing it would do. Also, what is FSR, and is it

            our embellishment of such was born from past trouble and pain. And so we've learned, more and more, how

            I recognize that my place in life is better than others: in both time and fortune. I know that we are
            privalaged as to be set regarding fundemental things. But I also submitt to the fact that our own
            actions
            bring us into the lushness of these ways. For if we miss work, whither in health, then our good times
            and

            I center all my thoughts, or orbit them at least, around Plutarchs notion, 'that all must abide reason;
            and
            it is into adulthood that we really become acquainted with such, as if nature is showing us her fullest
            claim; while childhood holds us under nothing but our parents regard'.
            <br>&emsp;Where I'm a bit unsure is in what nature asks of us: or what is the groove in which our
            'rational
            resolve' is slotted into.
            <br>&emsp;For I see, in work for instance, that it comes and goes, but with an unceasing rythm. And thus
            our
            actions ought not merely appropriate to the moments of demand which come, but to the fact that such
            deeds
            are reoccuring. "And our habits and standard ought reflect that, stearing us towards a base congruency:
            so
            we are always well when such moments come."
            <br>&emsp;But it always comes back to other people, or at least regards for the world.
            <br>&emsp;And I believe, somewhat wholly, that this occurs because your baser amends are off, and thus
            you
            sit a little uneasy; or, if you find pleasure, it is of the sort which throughs you off upon your
            duties;
            which then directs you to 'less turbulent seas'.
            <br>&emsp;I submitt that there are moments when I am in complete harmony with my work and family; and
            upon
            that, I walk easy, breathe nicely, rest plenty, and live in vital strokes. For some time my life has
            reflected such, 'being tainted with not but the speckles of contrariety'. And indeed, I notice such
            frictions, 'as they stand out amidst our clear gaze'.
            <br>&emsp;"I can do it!" I find my self saying; crying almost at the certain relief.
            <br>&emsp;It is such claim, or intent rather, which holds the key. For if your mortal, enlisted, sick or
            employed, 'the mark of reason is in the way you oblige, the form of your response, the strenght in your
            lane
            --in which you go'.
            <br>&emsp;This is what requires time and effort. The simplicity of the Gods, or nature, or civil life,
            is
            such that seeing so as so simple is the only baser regard. "For we may see them befuddled and complex."
            But,
            in that simplicity, flows the stream of of living, 'and such waters are bent towards us rowing in the
            greatest way'.

            The question then, as always, is what ought you do. But the prompt for this is indeed the only hard
            part.
            For man has never come short in his ability to amend. "Be it through Flanders or elecric fields, he
            finds
            the way." But that the Germans should have marched on Brussels, or that the particles beneath should
            have
            been found, is not so easy to say.
            <br>&emsp;For we have many presumptions in life; and I do admitt, that in suggesting such, that we are
            giving to much weight to otherwise 'unimpactfull' factors. As the Gods may not in fact bear much in the
            minds of those who make amends.

            Whe I was younger, I felt this grinding irriation at the use of logic and metaphysics. God too, as a
            notion,
            also fell under this.
            <br>&emsp;What I found, was that all I needed to do, or at least what ceased this frustration, was being
            able to see both side of things; and from there, just naturally lean, be it in consideration or belief.
            <br>&emsp;Right now I am experiencing something similar for the world and governance. For whichever
            reason,
            depictions of violence and negativity about people and government burns at my soul. I feel frightened,
            scornfull and dismayed. It is from the fact that we have too little positive mentions of the government
            and
            the nature of her being so orderly and structured. In those motions, if by law or beuracracy she errors
            or
            detains, we at least know from which grounds.
            <br>&emsp;I won't compare this directly to philosophy, but the primary issue here is that we struggle
            with
            admitting anything harmfull or wrong; be it in governance or war namely. We have made great strides in
            our
            humanities, seeing the simplicity, honor and strenght by which officials and solidiers conduct
            themselves.
            "But then some clip on the news of a woman crying or man screaming consumes my mind with such imagery."
            And
            I resist this horror; for it's nature is so putrid, that it being so entirely is worth the abbrasion.
            But
            the issue, ultimately, is that I cannot admitt part of it being there, while also holding true to the
            other
            parts around. Again, my efforts have been in fortifying those other efforts, 'as if to squeeze any
            horror
            out'. Media though, be it of fiction or reality, is quite saturating, and not conducive for you to be so
            rational. The things you see and are impressed by, almost take on a life of their own; and by the
            abbrasive
            nature of them, warrant your emotions to take full charge and respond. "This is why I feel so poor, as I
            don't respond. Yet our compulsion to do so is born from such regards, as I frightfully see them."
            <br>&emsp;As it was with the Gods, I no longer need to prove the fairness of people, nor remedy the
            brutality of war. We can admitt the harsher sides of these things, while remaining in our prevalent good
            side. I feel curious then, or in search of understanding, as to why things occur the way they do, and
            how
            any of these awful moments occur. Indeed, via heuristics and poor concepts, we find mud and grit in our
            paces. But the earth is full of these things, amidst the grass and clouds. Our ignorance though, and
            lack of
            reflection as would serve our natural limits, pertrudes our ability to walk.

            Floating near the edge is our finest regards. Yet, their dearness is too much a glimmer, 'for there lies
            rot
            below'.
            <br>&emsp;This is so, I reckon, from the relation of ignorance and discomfort.
            <br>&emsp;And, sulking below, this becomes the beacon of our aims. "As if where we wish to go is brought
            upon by what such depths bring. This may be in aversion, honor, hope and fame."
            <br>&emsp;But I see, as I did with the Gods, how this is so when it comes to civil living.
            <br>&emsp;But who are we then, without such remarks. I feel airy, unfilled, and in search of
            understanding.
            Or I grind against that which would otherwise provide depth.
            <br>&emsp;Perhaps the truth is in all of us, that people are hurt, that some of it is unjust. But we
            must
            live, for our own sakes and of others. "For we must be with our own strides to meet that of others." And
            so,
            remarking upon what lies beneath is an ever going process, and one which calls on nothing but our regard
            through time. But to be moving through such point, 'flowing with the channel', requires we live.
            <br>&emsp;But this means honesty. As too much, and I will simply speak of myself, that our idea in life,
            our
            refuge, comes from the relief and or yearning bound through our depths. Perhaps there is real positivty
            down
            there; but so our darker sides. And my point, is that as those positive ends really find peace in there
            use,
            rather than far wonderment, that so ought we ignore what our fears and doubts prescribe, and more
            rightly
            be, as a man, 'who through time and relfection, may align to said demands'. Were just running otherwise,
            or
            hiding, in our ability to be here and present. "For there is none to judge us but ourselves. For we
            experience shame and peace, courage and praise."

            We might say, simply, that in life there is pleasure, sometimes known as passion, 'of something
            relieving in
            that we are comforted in being on route for', and then conditions, a demand; and as such, the response
            is
            one which offers peace and firmness, by virtue of the neccessary result which we are afraid to occur;
            and
            thus, the ease within, by 'our' ahility to meet otherwise. This, to be clear, is bounded by a
            surrounding
            prescence, a sort of cause in which your response is the measure, as it determines the effect, 'or at
            least
            is what we find to be the gauge for such'. While pleasure, in being bound to something, holds with it
            true
            comfort in that the moment is pleasing, but our response is one of ease by virtue of what were given: as
            if
            the cause is whats good.

            some chore, or something to do. It may slip my mind, but the effect is not forgotten, 'or aloof to me'.
            <br>&emsp;From that, I would say that there is room for pleasure in life, or for things good in
            themselves,
            but ought we be cemented in our conditions, 'as to avoid pain and grieving'; and thereby earn a proper
            calm
            and peace upon congruence; a feeling of ease and security, but through our endowed abilities: by our
            nature's simplciity, as opposed to fortune or pursuit.

            Going back, we were too torn and asunder to delight in the joys of youth. On one end, we felt consumed,
            or
            at least endowed, to the 'grown up' demands upon me. Not so much there trouble, but their ask. Grades,
            work,
            sports, chores, respect. Not to mention the future.
            <br>&emsp;My response to these was to deal with them as well I could, or felt like; but enough to
            satiate
            the source of the request. "I quite enjoyed the peace which would come; along with avoiding the ardour
            and
            disdain if I failed."
            <br>&emsp;I went through life this way, in effect getting by. But when it came to friends, this did not
            fly,
            as our relation with certain folk did not permitt me to be so intense; and in one moment I was, as we
            were
            familiar. "Which I can relate to a later experience, where I did not care for someone, and was rather
            removed from converse; but then upon them leaving, I was rather open, as if I was no longer hiding."
            Similarly, in this prior event, I was open based on our acquaitnece with said folk, but not actually
            connected enough to speak as I did. In an equal fashion, our first relationship floundered over our
            expectations, but shortcomings by me. Fortune also played a part, as my friend got thrown about, and
            left.
            And my second friend removed himself from our social circle.
            <br>&emsp;As such, I met the peak of our youth with dispair and the weight of indolence. This caused no
            interest in 'the future', but rather an abatement of our despondance; and, as it were, a contrasting
            indulgence.
            <br>&emsp;But time goes on regardless of how you orient yourself, and of the things I was avowed to
            through
            my youth, so did these remain. The nature of these being from my parents, meant, that upon by disease
            and
            reckless fruits, that so were we less effective in our duties, nor so willing to do it. So conflict
            ensued.
            <br>&emsp;I've always been afraid of girls, meeting strangers too. It's not that I am nervous if a
            situation
            brings us together; instead, theres a distaste, as if I would rather not see them. Extended family is
            similar, in that it feels like a task to meet with relatives. Only, when I get there and werre on
            'familial
            terms', I feel not that I must hide, and can just be. "I dont wish to fart," per say, but I want to
            laugh,
            run, eat and play. And it does not always feel like I can do this around older folks, or those, who by
            my
            younger estimate, are of a softer, quiter, and, at a later age, genial sort. I'd say this marks my
            truest
            delight.

            I must say, that the greatest difference between my younger and grown self, is the reliance, care and or
            interest for money. We make so little, strive for little, rely on so little, and otherwise amend and or
            attend to things that require and or thrive on such.
            <br>&emsp;What a mouth full.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, our remarks here are so stretched. As on one hand, you have this massive account of
            our
            life, 'one in which, by our age, we've made the most, and best of said accounts', regarding our place in
            life, the relation to work, duty, leisure and friends. "And all things nice and ahead."
            <br>&emsp;But we then have our younger years, where we loved food, to smoke even, to see Colin and Seb,
            playing games, watching movies and tv. I rememebr this getting thrown about, as going out with more
            friends,
            where drinking, driving, girls and drugs were the concern. There were at points lounging, 'but it was
            all
            chilling and hanging out'. Little of it actually felt like an activity or interest. And I just felt more
            inclined to the adventures with Colin than with Seb.

            I was always good as a kid. Relatively smart, for what it was worth, but very athletic. If there was
            soccer,
            I was nearly the best. At hockey, I played goal and had such a good time. I only ever played soccer
            league
            wise, but in all fashions, I could play well. "We'd play tag football, from one side of the field to the
            next, and I could score as many points as I like. I'd stop near the end just to keep playing." In short,
            I
            was fast.
            <br>&emsp;But I recall during my later years, that Lucas Henniger, and later Connor Mcfarlen, started
            keeping up with me. And I had this feeling, where I was not struggling to match them, but I no longer
            'sped
            past them'. By their efforts it seemed, they caught up. And my response was not to work harder as to be
            even
            further, but to keep in line with them, in a genial fashion. I would joke though, as if it were my
            mantle to
            maintain, 'and I'll win, and you come first'. It was as if I were responding to their efforts, and
            making
            sure they didn't overreach. I remember our final year, thinknig Connor might have beat me. He didn't,
            but I
            rememeber being more or less surprised when I candidly one.
            <br>&emsp;It is strange to think though that I felt some sort of shame, or embarrsement at the thougnt
            of
            losing. I'd tack it up to the fact that our success, in late childhood at least, was from our nature,
            rather
            than training. Those other guys nearly beat me, and had my eye when their effort began to equal mine. I
            felt
            so thwarted and scared, for I had no effort of my own. "I was soon to be last, in my mind, for being
            first
            was all I really knew. But whereas someone who trains consistently and comes second keeps on, as there
            efforts bring to carry forth, our natural momentum would have ceased, as it was merely our strides going
            where they could naturally, 'like a mighty steed who was strong in principle, but not habition'." And
            so, if
            we were to come second, running would mean nothing to me, as we would simply be doing what we did,
            'unaccalimed by our short prestigousness', but not then bent or aimed at anything further. "As if the
            tide,
            or the crowds eye past me by, looking to those ahead: to a place my future had no sight of."
            <br>&emsp;I felt this pressure from 'unexcellence' throughout my life. I would see where I was in fact
            prestine, and by that, recognized by the peak of our success. I felt so good being so high. I didn't
            even
            feel great about my self, but rather at peace in being so indifferent. "For where else could I go." But
            as I
            aged, and things became more challenging, and relatively speaking, people got stronger, or ordained at
            least
            to those feats, so was our moderate point of success not so accomodating to indifference. We felt poor,
            lame, unappealing and unknown. Our momentum within this had us bolted to such challenges; as I did not
            wish
            or strive for anything akin to excellence, 'but in line with how poor we felt', we responded to such
            things
            with the mind of not feeling so bad. Success for us was that which did not leave us feeling embarrassed.
            If
            we went on a long run, good was not coming in first or anything of a remarkable sort; it was whatever we
            felt solid about. If we got a bad grade, we were embarrassed to share, and scared to show it to our
            parents.
            Getting Bs then felt good enough. But you see, there was no care about the things in themselves, but how
            we
            felt in response to succeeding as we did. "It was how we felt positioned in relation to others; be it in
            expectation, or seeming impresseve, or at least adaquate."

            So I have no issue with anybody.
            <br>&emsp;However it's best to characterize this, I will simply say, with love and interest, or pure
            decent
            respect, I am such for a person of any ethnicity, sex or creed. I simply don't mind; and recognize any
            of my
            averionsor bewilderments as (my) personal perversions and stupidities.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, I hate others being treated poorly, shamefully, with contempt, or even with hatred,
            abuse
            or arrest.
            <br>&emsp;But I take a moment, for instance, of someone saying that a company, or some person, is no
            longer
            of the sort, in support and or expression, regarding mistreatment of certain people. It is these moments
            where I am not clear and or connected to the beligerence and effective plight of people. "A sort of
            phonnieness flags infront of me."
            <br>&emsp;A better way of looking at this, is when someone says something progressive or affirming, I am
            not
            against their point, at all. I am simply not privy or connected to the triumph: as if there was
            something
            wrong being abated. Be it touting, preaching, rhetoric or vitriol, I become overt. Better yet, I find
            the
            statement abrasive, and feel it muddled in the broader appeal to others; meaning, I don't particualry
            averse
            myself, but I reckon others do. I don't need good reasons or sense for other's lives to improve. By
            sentiment even. But when the misdeeds of others are inherent to the claim, or progress at least, I see a
            sort of defense and furledness by those who are averse.
            <br>&emsp;My understanding, is that the world is a complex of points, each reflecting finer instances.
            From
            continents to countries, states to counties, to towns and neigjbours, streets and homes; family and
            friends,
            man and himself. I feel that bullying, rape, molestation, putrid beligerence, ordinary beligerence even,
            lying, cheating, stealing, murder, fatal negligence, abuse, assault and formidable begurdgery, is
            distributed within each strata to a degree which is, in all natural light, less than there is so. Nor do
            I
            feel, beyond fundementals, 'which are not born purely in expanse but depth also', that of a moment of
            such
            'grievences', that they are not intense causes of other similar moments; and thus, they are not to be
            deemed
            caused by such moment themselves.

            I say this for the sake of inquiry; for I may bounce things off a defined edge.
            <br>&emsp;That is, people care for things in their liberated state. "As was once delighted in, or
            sought, as
            a child." But due to civil and or customary duty, or manner, we are advised, 'and in many ways steared',
            away from such things.
            <br>&emsp;What I notice though, is that what people find good in this realm, or strata of life, is with
            respect to their duties underneath. Regarding riches, power, pleasure and fame, one could almost say, in
            a
            statemet for instance regarding their worth, 'such an such is quite good, considering our current
            state..
            Such things would be so nice, considering where we are; and, with such bounds in mind, it is quite
            comforting to know that we can achieve these further goods'.
            <br>&emsp;In other words, we tend to make, or act at least, via conditios. We accept our role in life as
            employees, parents, friends, individuals of health. And so the surrounding elements of pleasure,
            contribution, craftmanship and joy, are given interest and or refuge, with the context of those
            endowments.
            "Who we are, as we know, in terms of the things we see as oppertune, and or thereby seek, is gauged not
            only
            by the quality of our interest, but also our condition in life. As if the murmur of our heart is not the
            only factor in remarking upon some far delight, but also the naturally reserved and or implaced
            sensation of
            our feet beneath our local committments."
            <br>&emsp;As a kid you have no such bounds, at least prominently. You must go to bed on time, not scream
            or
            shout when it's late, or while your visiting relatives. You must go to school, be more or less
            attentive, go
            to soccer practice on weekdays and games on weekends. There are some chores, in washing mainly. And to a
            degree, gifts are obtained for giving.
            <br>&emsp;But we have no judgement upon the shortcomings of our efforts, in quality. If we get good
            grades,
            great; but were not scorned if we get too few. We have no employments, nor shame in not doing so. Our
            health
            is given little regard by anyone, and you generally do as you please. "It's strange to think that is all
            we'd be under measure for."
            <br>&emsp;Intertestingly, the concern for school and employment is one, in a further sense, for
            children,
            marriage and family. If you remove these, then the need is one of yourself; as your roof and food come
            from
            your dependants; which is itself a subject to question. But in general, it is not unfair to suggest that
            independance is both sought and or at least natural to pursue; or if only the later reach. And as such,
            money is neccessary for the cost of your own living.
            <br>&emsp;The balance I've experienced, is that simple work is sufficient for our personal living. Yet,
            it
            does not always create, or conduce with pleasures that make that work 'unlaborous'. But it never feels
            compelling enough to cultivate other means of work, for the sake of being less laborous. Indeed, more
            money
            means more things, which can make the demands of work more bearable. But we have leaned towards goods
            which
            require little money.
            <br>&emsp;The point, is that as a kid, I did indeed enjoy the eggs of easter or meals of Christmas. But
            our
            truest joy was in sport, running through the woods, games and things of a creative sort. I understand
            that
            these cost money, in enrollment, suppliess, or consumption even. "As Lego came as a gift, and was
            generally
            expensive." As an adult though, I've taken this direction, and applied it where my 'meager income' can
            support. It is by fortune, time and grace that I earn things of mechanical sort: computer, shoes, bike
            and
            playstation. But with these, I tend to have the means to do what is limited only by time and effort. I
            can
            browse the internet, write in word processors, play Battlefield over and over, or walk and run as my
            legs
            will carry. For many years I felt fine with this, and sought patronage for food and a simple bed. This
            has
            its niceities, but also shortcomings. And currently, as our true adulthood is coming to bloom, I see the
            natural benefit of living as though I were providing such needs, even if fortune were offering. "For the
            main error of eventuality is removed, in that, of some future, be it naturally reached or sought, in
            which
            you did provide for yourself, does not come as something to adjust to, as your already living as such."

            In the recent years, we've gone through several periods of focus, where reading, writing, formatting or
            creation were prevalent. And I always felt great here, as I was doing something, and set for further
            effort.
            Something always lying ahead.
            <br>&emsp;But now, we've moved, settled, are employed and with nothing but freedom ahead. Yet I know not
            what to do. I have found some pleasure in gaming, and work has brought a great rythm to my life. But
            were
            not doing anything special.
            <br>&emsp;It does seem like yoga and music have found their place, as have movies and varied YT
            channels, in
            relation to our coming and going from work. For some time we've meant to try dating online, or go to
            yoga.
            Each seems daunting at the moment. "Which only has me feeling the pressure from that which has me less
            open."
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, there lies this personal effort, of how were seated, the prescence of work, and the
            regiment, or regard at least, for exercsie and food. But, as this reaches a state of bloat, we look for
            pleasure. As were too tired to go do other things, but were also set for better living. "As if the pipes
            are
            never well enough." But this state is one of waiting. As we've run for instance and trained, and are
            looking
            to do some tomorrow, and the next. We have no sense that our effort will cease; but as of late, we've
            concentrated on it dearly, and had to do some of the heartier things upon a bare state; which has left
            me
            well worked, but needing to weather it out. "And let our initial strenght incorporate itself."
            <br>&emsp;I find in these moments that idle thoughts and grievences occur. As we are not so ordained,
            but
            rather still. Happily, and with the ointment of pleasure, but also with some friction and out of
            shapeness.
            "Were not so well worked, that our pitch is but less prominent, yet forward. Our peak was high, but
            small
            now as the ryhtm comes to be; but only then for us to move; which is much of our learing so far, as to
            cease
            the need to improve."
            <br>&emsp;There is worth mind you in letting your imageries and or irratable remarks float on by. For
            the
            things which spurr them are not really being dealt with. And instead of mourning their prescence,
            address
            the fact that your going to let the emotiosn they trigger slide on by.
            <br>&emsp;But were left then, almost struck by our relative amount of work, in a state of rather
            slowness.
            And if we let the sparks of the world float by, but hold little view for ourselves, then we are left
            with
            nothing but the present. Such a state, if it were of better quality, 'in that it held a balance of
            movement
            and rest, rather than the beginnings of such momentum', would be easier to sit with; but instead, we
            find
            ourselves catering our intent to efforts invovling it ahead, and through such 'single sightedness', find
            reason for pleasure; as we feel more or less set from our current effort, and oriented to whats to come.
            But
            the compulsion for pleasure seems only fair, in that there is a straightforward view of what's to be
            done.
            And perhaps thats fair. But the nature of these efforts is that they provide little moments, or at least
            prescence, for oppertunity, recreation or friends. Were too busy with ourselves. And reaching momentum
            with
            such is not then a key to those things, 'as if our personal buisness is done'. For you then have to
            attend
            to the buisness of those other goods. Which is something that, if you did now, would bring more room and
            levity to your personal one's. For your left otherwise with the mere comfort of doing something, but not
            for
            the end of it.
            <br>&emsp;I resolve to the fact, or recognize at least, that our preferred spot ahead is one, where we
            go to
            yoga, perhaps travel for other things, take some nice pictures and post them online, for chats, quick
            dating, 'online rooms', or relations. These would give a well needed, and able, adornment to our life.
            We
            are fine on the ground. And despite needing room and reason, by habit and the direction we make, so can
            this
            become unintruding or a drag to those broader goods. Ought we play with Tristan, or find some resources
            to
            share our sums. I think your life in general, for interests in light and vision, spectroscopy and early
            government, would come about alongside our further attendances. As we are employed, with relativley
            solid
            finances, and family harmony, 'in both the present and time ahead'. But we are making narrow use of
            this.
            All, mind you, for the sake of ourselves. We need be honest though as to what's required, and hopefully
            reach a point where the good we normally seek, is strong enough as to be more merry and fufilling, and
            bear
            room and agreement to the relatively light requirments of rewards of friendship, dating, submission and
            love. These things seem like hurdles, as our parched state seeks more from them. But get yourself in
            line,
            so your up and ready enough, as to do these things in their right fashion. Merely submitt your sums, and
            relish the regard. And equally for dating. Putting ourself out there is what, in contrast, we lack. Were
            too
            hard done to begin, and thus feel closed.

            My aim here is not to permitt gratuity. Nor do I wish to indulge in 'a seemingly final resolve'. But I
            do
            wish to attend and address something of importance, namely, in what is needed of for health.
            <br>&emsp;This is something that will always be present. And like our professional and or social cares,
            or
            projects abound, so will we continue to mend such things: bringing them into our life as time goes on.
            <br>&emsp;But right now, looking back, our momentum is rough, and our fatigue is coming too closely. By
            whichever cause, our resitance training, 'or range of motion under load', is much too little; and thus
            our
            recovery, ease and easting are effected. This has only been exasterbated by work, as we tend to do less.
            Our
            system is fine, but our muscles are reaching abscence. And sitting is not truly comfortable.
            <br>&emsp;Doing more squats though is not something I wish to, or see much worth in, if it is just on a
            whim. More structure is needed, as to produce more volume, and also congress with the path of
            consistency;
            as you see what your doing ahead, and let your current effort be what it is. This also brings more room
            for
            pleasure, levity and adjustment.
            <br>&emsp;There are simple things we can do, which won't run contrary to our heightened efforts for
            health.
            We may sign up for online dating, take better pictures when we can, and simply message people with an
            introduction. Someone replied to me, and I felt calm and great. We can be more open to this, without
            spending an arm and a leg. Yoga is even moreso, as it's right there, 5 or 6 bucks, a tremendous garment
            to
            your physical life; and also something which can bring clarity, structure, and a sense of place. Their
            on
            monday mornings or nights, Thursday nights or Friday mornings. Simple. Another thing, which I've already
            conducted, is the proper paces of gaming. If your playing with Matt, tell him if your gathering, and the
            server is up. "We can talk when were doing something together." Same thing for battlefield. If your
            playing
            a match, let him know, and play for a while, or simply say your done. Just ask. But foremost, you need
            not
            be with him so frequently. He isn't going anywhere. Let your day go, play as you please, and be reticent
            if
            you wish, considering that you may wish to, or feel fairly compelled, to play longer together. If you
            can't
            manage that, than say nothing. It never hurts also, to figure out the threads of interest, be it in
            music,
            youtubin, movies, games or shows. At least make a list, for which your curious and or natural regard can
            flow to; your expectation and or discovery will ensue.

            We will surely say more on this later, but right now, I'd say the most critical concern is in bringing
            out
            more volume. And the clearest means to do that is measurement.
            <br>&emsp;For volume is sought on two basis: continuity and production. For one, if we do enough, we
            will
            bear quality to the paces which bring sufficeincy; for the other, so will we have worked enough.
            <br>&emsp;In terms of measures, you have the matter of reps, be it in skips and the bounds we make back
            and
            forth; or the rotations of poses, in lifts for instance.
            <br>&emsp;The purpose of this, to be clear, is not one of strict parameters, but rather a blend of
            targets
            we can reach and be grounded by. For we may just go out, but in that, produce more if we have some sense
            of
            quantity. "A whim may make for 2 sets, while bearing discretion may reach 3." This makes it easier to
            attempt things also, as small efforts still feel of some quanity.
            <br>&emsp;On one hand, you have the general tenants of reps and bouts; which we'll describe as number of
            motions, and rounds of doing so. These may cross over with one another, in that you do some amount of
            reps,
            then pause, and do more; and you may count these as one group of reps, or a split. But in general, we
            give
            more leniance, or place, for variety in rounds.
            <br>&emsp;On the other hand, you have the actual motions and or poses, and what you feel best fits them.
            Instead of fitting them to some concieved measure, look for measures which fit them, as you know them
            already and can consider what best suits them. Skipping for instance, finds a great deal of benefit in
            marking the reps per bout; but is not so strengthened by concerns of how many bouts. The nature of the
            motion is a simple one, and so keeping the bout that you do do, 'as you could in theory do many', means
            that
            giving strucutre to those that you do is the primary concern. For it is not too uncommon for simple
            things
            to be overlooked, as each spout of effort feels of no consqeunce. Squats compare in this regard, as do
            lighter bouts of running. In regards to pushups and bar work, your ability to plank and or hold said bar
            is
            the limiting factor; and a pure motivator for strenghtening such means. But, based on your limit, you
            may
            benefit from emphasizing rounds, as to return to the short moments of stability. "As slipping, per say,
            is
            not very enduring, but a formal deficit: but as such, welcomes you return to a brief balance."
            <br>&emsp;As it were, gloves and height are the limits of bar work. Moreover, I will speak in this
            moment as
            if such work is essential. Since all bars are different, you ought accomodate them, in your height and
            grip.
            You may bring any sort of stool. Something solid and even moderatley high makes our initial holds that
            much
            stronger. Regarding location, Jones is open weekends, Pitt on weekdays. There is a park down the road,
            but
            less it's raining, there may be people there. We also have our annex; but the largely better handle is
            blocked. We may improve and or adjust to the futile one, but to no avail perhaps.

            My body is reaching for a bit of sugar. But rather than agree to that, let's come back to our direction.
            <br>&emsp;I see, clearly, that we need smaller sessions, for legs and supine, some prone, and for lifts,
            and
            perhaps some warrior and or lunging to boot. We've got good videso for our system, namely in the forward
            fold to downward dog, and the hero pose to butterfly. These are great; though a simpler standing one
            would
            do.
            <br>&emsp;But we do need a stretching mean, for we may be in the middle of the day, and wish to cross
            our
            legs, or lie on our back, or stomach. As may we benefit, in our deliberate effort, or when a stronger
            whim
            passes by, to do our lifts, ie. plank, chaturanga and downward dog. In their case, you could emphasize
            more
            breaths or the pure flow. I'd say, with reason, that our guides would be more akin to the latter, while
            our
            everyday bouts would become more of the former.
            <br>&emsp;Indeed, a simple seated sequence is great for neck and shoulders (along with arms); while an
            upright, legs in front session, is great for your legs and hips, followed by sinking onto your back. But
            you
            may also do more of a livening sequence for legs, in your low twists, quad stretch; basically, a focus
            on
            range of motions, while the former is about rinsing out (remedying the knots.)
            <br>&emsp;So those are some videos to make, and short ones at best. I will say, for merriment, that we
            can
            use bird, or other channels. I prefer Adrian, but any is fine. The strucutre we need is important. Plus,
            for
            the sake of smoothness, we can take the videos we currently use and put them in their own file, as to
            make
            touching them up easier. I still find worth in our wide legged sesh, or the warrior one even. But these
            are
            for that time when you have nothing to do, or any sense at least. Our hero/back pose was not the hit I
            thought it'd be, as it's really a relaxing cooldown. Our lunge and downward dog flow has been done
            plenty,
            because it is simply and nourishing. We need more things like that.
            <br>&emsp;As for motion, I see merrit in our measurable aims. The sense I got, for instance, when doing
            a
            certain set based on distance, made it so I did more sets than I would normally. You can do the same
            thing
            with reps.
            <br>&emsp;I reckon, or would lay things rather, that you either look at the measure within the set, and
            considering that gauge, do as many sets as fits your means to such gauge. For the set your doing may be
            of
            reps and many, say 10; but then you may just do as many sets as fits your ability to do as much of those
            sort of sets. Opposite of this is an emphasis on rounds, or number of sets, in that you set out to do a
            certain amount, and let your reps be what they are. Pullups are an example of this, as you may not be
            able
            to emphasize reps enough, and thereby, give prevalence to the amount of sets; and just do the reps you
            can
            in each case. These usually occur when your balance (so to speak) is quick to fail; and so with an
            initial
            burst of strenght, you do what you can within that stable window, then rest.
            <br>&emsp;Another notion is of rythm, or pace. Pauses remark your time in a set, where you do 5, or go
            to a
            point, take a breath, then come back. While resting is between sets, in that you collect yourself. A
            break
            between exercises is good too, be it in waiting or recovery.
            <br>&emsp;In regards to our life, I feel a natural rythm, whereby our principle strenght provides a
            balance
            of rest and effort, is not so reliable. It is our general direction, but life, in its circumstances, and
            our
            choices, have brought me to a less than affiable state. It is as if our finances are low, and we are
            counting on basic principles to acquire money.
            <br>&emsp;The issue, is that we are not perfect. And perhaps our life is not formidable enough to
            accomodate
            me not being so 'imperfect', when our foundations for doing things that'd otherwise make me happy, 'and
            less
            keen for indulgence'. Moreover, it would seem, that the far end of those things which, upon abscence,
            bear
            me to be so mighty myself, actually come, in relatively simplicity, 'as things do while your in motion',
            but
            alos greatly, 'necceasrily for the furthest of things, but also the more likely for things of a dearly
            far
            sort'.
            <br>&emsp;I don't mean to go far off in position, making it woven in a way that reflects our yearning
            and
            wishes; nor to admitt any excess of desire. Further, I would say, in our liberties, that we are fine, in
            our
            own consent and of that which, so much as our consent is at liberty to be, but just, so are we fair on
            that
            count to make the moderate amount of money we do, and in congruence with that, our rythmic nature
            through
            the according employment. Were all fine to be as we are. Our life, in dreasm and or possibility, lie
            years
            ahead, while our concern now is thorugh the months to come. Such a course is such as to, through it's
            whims,
            and upon its sturdier side, create clarity and or according motion towards those things which our
            'unideal
            state' is merely yearning and or with angst towards. All seems well.

            I am writing this because I have something serious to say, 'and writing seems the only way to be
            detailed
            and honest'.
            <br>&emsp;My life has been too sparse of activity. Going to work has abated that. I've also been too
            removed
            from people. Work, directly, has improved that, and has given me more interest and motion to meet/reach
            out
            to other people. In terms of my rhythm in life, I'm pleased with the amount of work I do.
            <br>&emsp;For money, the future is unknown, but not otherwise a concern of mine. On one hand, you must
            add
            the 'Ryan tax', which is a sort of patronage I get from simply being me. "If someone were given a 1000$,
            I
            would find equal worth in 700." And so if I seem to work little, and earn as such, remember that my
            effort
            is worth more. "As I get more use of it." Practically then, if I leave this home a year or two out with
            10,000$, yahoo. If it's13,000, it would not seem a difference. Nor 9,000 mind you. I am happy to reach
            this
            by putting away 500$ a month. I could do more, but the fair and merry means which give me what I
            currently
            have, feel so comfortable and right, that I can't help but be pleased with the amount. To me it's
            reasonable, and if it is agreeable to you, I'll care otherwise for things which bring me delight --or
            are
            meaningful beyond money.
            <br>&emsp;With all that in mind, I've heard you talk about your intent to diet. I wish to do something
            similar. This is the sort of thing which takes time, is a kind of work in its own right; and so I bring
            all
            that stuff up about money, so that we understand how that side of things is being properly dealt with,
            and
            sufficiently, so that I may then focus on the business of health. I normally do so, but in a casual way.
            I'd
            like to be more measured, and give my self permission to treat these efforts as if they were serious and
            long term.
            <br>&emsp;I am going to start going to yoga (at the rec centre), and also go on dating sites --apps
            maybe,
            but ughh. Getting started with these is a little unnerving, and I feel slightly begrudged. But I'm
            figuring
            it out. I'm gaming with my friends, which is nice; though, this has its own issues, as you end up gaming
            too
            much ---as it's hard to play a game with someone for 20 minutes, which are the bouts I like to do.
            Again,
            I'm figuring this out. But I am feeling overall, that my health is withering, and my habits, albeit good
            naturally, are not exhibited greatly, as were not measured or directed in what were doing. "We end up
            doing
            too much at once in response, which causes wear and tear, and nothing following." So, with respect to
            the
            months to come, I'd like to take my health more seriously, but without such haste. All these things,
            from
            friends, work (and maybe love) are nice; but my interest in them is of a complimentary sort, in that
            they
            surround me, in support and comfort. Me, personally, is full of holes and leaks, and so, 'as you mean to
            do
            with your diet', I'd like to do something similar.

            For squats, I find good value in the side shuffle, as you get some lateral motion, while position
            yourself
            for better drops. The volume is not changed, though the clarity of each rep is. But no matter, I tend to
            think of squats in terms of reps and distance. You may do 10, and rather quickly, or do some amount near
            5,
            with a pause between. Then do this 3 times.
            <br>&emsp;For pushups, I am limited by our ability to plank. You can reset into downward dog, or you
            forward
            fold. But once you return to standing, your done your set and recovering. Wider arms make for easier
            dropping, along with shallower lowering; you need not touch your chest to the ground. By that, I would
            say 5
            reps is a solid amount, and you can do 3 sets. Ideally, you'd do 3 sets, of several reps, pause, then
            several more. I think overall though, we beenfit the most by our pure rep volume, doing as many as we
            can in
            one bout, assuming we can do a fair amount.
            <br>&emsp;For chinups, things are similar. You may striclty do two super sets, with an amount of reps
            that
            is bounded by your first and second bout. Or you can do 4-5, and do this 2-3 times. For pushups and
            pullups,
            the more concentrated they are, the fewer sets.
            <br>&emsp;Free range is measured in distance, where you go, pasue and come back. This is good as an
            exercise
            itself, for 3 sets. Or if your warming up, you may do one long set with several pauses, and some number
            (say
            5) of reps between. Or, you can do 5, pause, then 5, rest, then 5, pause, 5, recover. Rotations wise,
            you
            can do 3 forward, 3 back, rest, and repeat two more times. "I prefer resting for these, rather than
            pausing."

            I feel an air of confidence. Something I've felt before. It's the sort of thing where reason, in the
            effect
            she brings, is seen in full light, and you know, by your calm and delight in the result, that she was
            right.
            I feel were on route to such things now.
            <br>&emsp;There is a great deal, plenty even, near and on the horizon. I won't go into it all, but as
            for
            our home, mom given me her blessing to do as I see well. Our dad is even less concerned. Some of our
            remarks
            may be unappreciated; and I do hesitate to say that we have a soul shift. But in the grand scheme of
            things,
            it's not about that, but our time, living.
            <br>&emsp;For so long we've been caught under the rim of divine impediment, or causless melancholy.
            There is
            indeed a balance; one of which motion brings you away from the 'bi polar' edges.
            <br>&emsp;I feel there is much to say, as if, beyond privalage and fortune, or sense even, that were
            trying
            to figure things out.
            <br>&emsp;At the bottom sits our truest bounty, namely, the calm and even score of daily delight. The
            thing
            which our writing reflects, in all its many strides. "the sort of experience that upon extremes even, we
            can
            rest easy, as we fear no circumstance: nothing can take this away."
            <br>&emsp;And so, that is the light infront of us, the purpose taking form. We ought merely go, so that
            we
            aren't so distant from the process, nor bolted in. Our health has risen itself as the key predicament;
            as
            ignoring your training and food leads to all things comnig to a still. Work is fine and plenty, and our
            social life is at the very least warm. In terms of passion or pursuits, we have yoga, the fields and
            scenery, plus the general delight of everyday being, in movies, shows, vids and games, along with our
            writing, reading, study and craft. All of this blends well when our fundementals are in check. These
            need no
            elevation beyond common goodness; but the proportions of that are no so swell. Were still apprehensive
            about
            yoga; as were we a little distanced from work, 'and at the moment, feeling our sparse time with it'. Our
            general health is good, but part of its foundations are too thin. Our training is too little, in
            running,
            free range and resistance. Our yoga has come out of hiding with great benefit. Though the majority of
            it's
            design has not kept our attention, 'and the bloom we were experiencing has sizzled off'. We are
            remedying
            this though, as are we filling out our diet with proper food. "Barley and Potatoes being the prologue to
            our
            work day."
            <br>&emsp;Where I lack though is in purpose. Even if it is setting, and we need only further; with the
            sense
            as to bear it some form, while mainting the requisite provision of material, or substane ---which, for
            almost our whole adult life, has been souly present, and little of the former 'forming'. We have, to be
            fair, remarked upon basic things, which in it's own right, gave stature and grace to such things, 'and
            thus
            a place for them: namely in work and family'. As have we been more directed, or at least aware of the
            baser
            needs, when it comes to leisure and craft. But as regards life, there is this notion of creation,
            teaching,
            the public. And this, being perhaps the natural route for all things sizeable, is ill-formed due to the
            complexion of our interests --or material in such form-- but also in the conduct of our motions, 'where
            we
            are, in some cases for instance, aware of our over bearing care, and how the form which such wish
            exclaims,
            is in fact born, and unbecoming, of haste and yearning. For which we don't ordain'.
            <br>&emsp;I guess then, we are left to bear thought to the fruts of our process. It seems the proper
            thing,
            'for we are not destined nor patroned to great ends', to be doing merely so. For if we resolve ourselves
            to
            live well, and not be so idle nor with too much haste, then we are merely going, growing by virtue of
            our
            embalmed state. But so, in this, as such state takes form, so is this what we should remark upon. For
            the
            end is not already made, but becoming from our state. Perhaps you've already made up your mind, or
            someone
            for you.
            <br>&emsp;Of that, I relate to Plato and Aristotle, with the interest of opening a school. Not a place
            for
            disciples or profession, but a place to learn, grow, mature. This exists in a basic sense, regarding
            grade
            schools and universitites. But these feel more vocational. And as much as they are about the knoweldge
            we
            seek for ourselves, I find this to be either lacking, or unremarkable. And so much as it isn't, so is
            originality, as perhaps the end fruit we seek, something which embellishes the fairness of a school from
            me.
            <br>&emsp;The way I see it, is that a dsicpline, or profession, as regards ideas and what not, is aimed
            at
            proofs and advancment. But the practice of this is neccessarily formal, 'as only the truest truths are
            to be
            permitted'. And this is indeed fair. But, regarding the Gods for instance, despite this importance, it
            is
            generally accepted, or sought by some, to have a view of their own; to merely lean, suspect, doubt, or
            believe even, but in a way which remarks their liberty to do so. While others are crunching the numbers,
            developing the deepest of truths, ought all folk have views themseles. Ones they've formed and sculpted,
            as
            remarks their curisoities and concerns: the elements of their own thoughts and sight.
            <br>&emsp;This is what the school is, a place in which inquiries and position are made. For each memebr,
            they are gifted with the peace in having no recourse about being wrong, as nothing they say or state is
            bound to judgement. "What one feels is not appropriately measured as so. What we have are words of
            interest
            and curisoity, not fact." Importantly though, is that, be it someone of strict discipline, or a common
            person with novel contributions, that so is this mode of curisoity and doubt duly requiste: little would
            ever be learned if we weren't somewhat so. And so forming your views under the guise of suspicion and
            strenght, is not only useful for you, as you may converse and or respond in simple and gracefull
            weights,
            but you may also suggest, re-adjust upon another's critique or beligerency. And I don't claim that my
            common
            view of physics or philosophy is endowed with fruitfull promise; despite this being what the confidence
            of
            the romantics (or those of the literary sort) claim. But we can at least serve as farmers for the more
            adminsitravite hands within the discipline. "For in funding, we exhibit support and praise; nor can we
            fail
            to produce inspiration for them to more greatly apply. For do scientists and governors not have family
            and
            friends, colleuges, neighbours and countrymen? Forget the negative effects which the friction with these
            produce, but the missed oppertunity had they been so thoughtfull themselves." Would a wife or spouse who
            could listen and inquire as to their partners work and discovery, not soften and restore said partners
            susbquent attempt?

            This notion of personal wealth, as in the equity in your own self, as to procure a better experiene; as
            contrasts with the procurement of comfiness, storage, security even, and more or less pomp and novelty.
            This
            is a nice sentiment.
            <br>&emsp;Were asked to do something, to strive for such wealth. Or, were pointed towards some
            meaningfull
            end, where we spread a messae, form a community: remarking some cause.
            <br>&emsp;But I feel the vanity of the former is not totally removed from the latter. As the former is
            bent
            on some elaborate end; for which wisdom does not cry if you fail. But this need to move, this sense that
            your not, to which your wish for pronoumcent is found, is itself a sort of restless exertion. For ends
            that
            are not so lavished, but still outside oneself, but for the sake of others.
            <br>&emsp;This does not seem to reflect a true course of living. If we remove drama and narratives, then
            we
            realize that much of which happens in life is duly so from the weighing nature of existence. "It was no
            tyranny that made food a challenge to reach." Even if there are poor characters, our ignornace generally
            accomdates to much room for simplfiying such an impression into a characture. It is more true that
            effects
            in life are from the ordinary buisness of living. And all the change that has occured, happens inch by
            inch,
            almost imperceptible. Even upon great insight, the novelty is mixed in with the massive norm. And so it
            is
            quite hard to say how a difference is made. "Our criticisms of those who we deem the cause of certain
            effects, feels more like the fruits of intellectualism, broad concepts, and an ignorance of the complete
            domain of the past."
            <br>&emsp;I don't mean to say that there isn't something wrong, or that there aren't people producing
            this.
            Nor do I deny the prescence of evil, 'or actions which are of such'. But I don't beleive our admittence
            of
            this rests on a knife point; and as such, I don't see our amends, or regards rather, as being totally
            towards a world in need of saving, and our according amend, or one which is simply stuck in the ordinary
            sway of things. There is room for change. And perhaps even moreso due to the advent of communication.
            But
            the fundementals are all that shift. And it is a rather juvenile oversight to think that the motions of
            the
            public, who perhaps tilt such fundmenetals, is in itself a direct and crucial cause. It may be the
            means, or
            at least way of faciliation; but to the thing which produces impact. And everyone talking about this or
            that, is more often than not chit and chatter, 'added to the immense bin of talk'. As such, there is
            much
            motion, but not with any real fortitude or resolve. "The advent of modernity is in it's freedom and
            ability
            to make change. But the virtue required, or quality exhibtied through maturity, is some sort of form, a
            basis for your direction." In the common tongue, where arguments are given less favor for broader sense
            and
            appeal, we are left with the choice of a person, to mould themselves more particularly and definite, or
            to
            be more general, in inquiry for instance, but less cemented --albeit tender and strong.

            When I look at our interests, to share things, spread messages, make an impact, I see that the real
            impetus
            is of cultivating our interest. For instance, graphics excite me, yet I can speak of them little. And I
            dream of being able to remark about how well things look (or not); and this is usually through the form
            of
            analyis or common discussion. But the reasonable thing to believe, is that this conception is really in
            service of you being able to see something better your self. "As opposed to caring whther or not someone
            else sees it." And, the most important aspect, is taht of the potenial in life, for change and fame,
            impact
            and or advancemnt, that it is done so for the progess you actually make; which is in a state which you
            are
            sharing or furthering (while unseen): it is not though, marked upon, by whether other people are aware
            and
            or care that you know. "It is not about us being seen."
            <br>&emsp;Out of interest, there may be reason to share you insights about games, as in many things. But
            it
            is not at all essential that we do. "Most of the results here are about people making decisiosn about
            purchaisng; which they are already at liberty to do." It is in environmental and or civil concerns which
            anyone with a broad interest is bound to. And ultiamtley I think we are wrong to ignore this; but merely
            heed it as it deems us to be, which is being a part of things, moving on.
            <br>&emsp;The thing in life to do, is truly be able, 'in that you are not in motion by drunken decree,
            or
            yearning haste, but a dear and steady hand'. And as this requires something, beyond that which yields
            something pecuniary. In many ways, the difference we've made in our life is the object of our
            foundations,
            the purpose of our aims. If we were more aligned to this, then the mean would seem simple, and we would
            not
            feel thrown about and or idle.

            There is a bit of peace in me. I reflect on the fact, that our whole life all I sought was that childish
            delight, the freedom to be, the abscence of chores and duty. A great deal fell within this, in school
            even.
            But we've never been one to work or do things of the sort; without the feeling that something fun and
            pleasurable was coming afterword.
            <br>&emsp;There is much to say here, but I will move on with the notion of reason, and how she garnishes
            me
            with a sort of trust in things; for she details what were to oblige, and how to abide; and the strenght
            in
            this makes for a great deal of constancy. Work and family have evened themselvs out in this way, as
            have,
            until recently, far off and novel things, such as friends, pals and romance to some extent. Even the
            idea of
            sending emails and correspondance: the moral is that you may simply try.

            So, in tandum with our rowing process, we be pleased to speak as were right to for each and every day.
            <br>&emsp;The first remark is of exercise. We have done a brief workout following our shift on Thursday,
            then another heftier one a few days following (and 3 days ago, on sunday I believe). I am only now
            feeling
            my body relieve itself. Yoga keeps our form statured, and so depsite our work not bearning us 'formative
            resitance', it still adds an overall materail to our strucutre and system: for which yoga refurbishes
            and or
            moulds. Still, we need to do pushups and squats, and some pulling to. Though, my feeling is we'd be so
            much
            better to run more often, do some concentrated work from time to time ---and hopefully to a fairer
            degree,
            upon our being consistent--- and then, as our ability grows, incorporate more strenght into our
            aerobics. Of
            that, our need for yoga is two fold: accesibility and the sessions. I'm finding great respite in editing
            the
            videos as they are, and leaving compositions for strict interest; such as lift training. Otherwise,
            letting
            things be releives alot of stress, and points me to a plethora of mateiral, for which I polish and
            shine.
            The '30 days' series is a great resource of rthis, and there is no limit as far as I can tell. "There is
            benefit from the director, whose put these things together. And you can remove some superfluous parts,
            or
            lengthen ceratin things. But the flow remains, and your creatvity is in making what is good better,
            rather
            than deconstructing it all, for a select few perfections." It seems best then, that we'd make a website.
            It
            seems that you get a free domain from github, and host it as we do with PlutarchHumeGreen. We can then
            show
            pictures, and arrange them; even if there are many. This will pair greatly with our editive interest.
            Perfection was fine, but liited, in that you needed further adjsutments; and things which were not in
            fact
            great were abanodoend. While tailoring what's there reatins the strenght present. Which, by our limit of
            effort, and overal care for the lot, makes for more abudnacnea and variety; which gives each session
            room to
            breathe. Your favorites become known and acquainted, but withotu relying on them to be so; and so other
            things can, for interest, circumstance or novelty, be tried.

            A few quick things. Work seems full of oppertunity, in that we can pick up shifts, get rid of shifts;
            and
            thus, switch to anytime. I consent to the fact, that on our course in life, we will have to adjust to
            the
            nature of a long shift. I reckon that it is two shifts in one ---and thus as such for time. You simply
            work,
            eat properly, and take your two breaks and lunch as to accomdate the double nature.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, we've picked up a shift now, have a good in with Teresa, and are generally on the
            up
            when it comes to work sentiment, effort and income. As such, I've decided to buy our scooter. I am not
            spending the 100 to repair the VMAX. It has been several weeks since the repair; though I do suspect its
            worth caution. In any case, we have new strips, new valves --which has removed all the leaking-- and we
            may
            buy more glue if need be. And so a solid tire scooter it is. It's got 750w power, which is fine for
            coming
            up the far end of harris --and there's literally no hills. Max speed is 22mph, which is suitable, as we
            seldom reached full 24 on the Vmax, nor ought we have. And the battery is better contained --or
            comparable
            at that. The battery is a 360, like the first scooter we had, comapred to our current 600. I reckon we
            only
            use 2/3 of that one, and are too hesitant to recharge. For common things, the 360 is more than suitable.
            Its
            long haul is shorter; and considering the solid tire permitts this, theres a bit of a shame. But there
            is
            still a great distance. One which is never exhausted locally, and seldom more than what we can more than
            reasonably achieve. And we may not be able to use it's stability in the furthest sense, but a good
            amount no
            less. We can surely go from one side of Burnaby to the other, or around Poco, or langley --using buses
            to
            get there, and around even. If we want to do that, or go into the farm lands, or into ridge, or out at
            night
            peacefully, we'll use this Jaison. Otherwise, around and to work, the VMAX lies.
            <br>&emsp;On a quick note, I find much grace in our focus, and thus seek little to be 'I was gonna say'
            guy.
            I do find it hard to relate and or connect with people. We have a friendly and cordial relationship with
            Andy, and broader one with Alex, and respectfull one with Teresa, and similr sorts for Josh, Chenoya and
            Reza. But Bella and I communicate little. I don't know what to say. I hear she coaches baseball, but
            were
            not together for it to come up. I felt a bit more spoken with her today, but nothing past courtesy
            chatting.
            I feel when she's there I can partake in the conversation, as she is much more open to Andy and Alex
            (for
            instance). Saying her name, hi as we walk by is a basic. Asking questions, when your alone. But don't
            force
            it. If your picking, and stop together, just bring up something about the shift, or what your doing.
            Don't
            resort to gossip or things made for the sake of conversation. Just bring up something about hers or your
            day; and speak about how good or bad the weather is. Ask her about baseball, when its over.

            I'll focus on two things: the need to eat early, and the effect of overly forming our principle.
            <br>&emsp;For the latter, I mean that, if our nature, or principle, is not bearing us vibrance or
            strenght,
            we may tailor our actions to iron this out. What tends to happen is that we overly push ourselves,
            namely in
            strenght. As a result, it is as if our normal form is drooping in certain spots, so we try and tighten
            those
            areas; but in the process tighten other areas which needed nothing. Something which comes to mind is our
            ability to push and pull, and how our general rigor in our back and shoulders permitts us to do so fully
            and
            true. If that is lacking, it is readily apparent that using said pushing and pulling to instate stature
            is a
            rugged afair. "The end being one where our stability is more like crookedness, and thus we can push and
            pull
            even less: or risk even further crookedness."
            <br>&emsp;As for the former, regarding food, it is not an issue to me that we'd eat more later on, but
            rather eat sooner in the day. Simply, if we are working early, then there is no reason to wait till the
            evening. If were starting work late, then we ought have some early form of lunch --be it apples,
            cucumbers,
            trailmix etc. And if we don't work at all, with the normal use of ruffage to smoothie --which we may
            include
            trailmix as well-- onto starch and grain. To note, if we mean to have a moment of higher calorie, this
            does
            not mean that were trying to find another food which we'll eat on a regular basis. We may judge our
            circumstance, in terms of things occured and to come, the matter of wholeness and sweetness. I am
            thinking
            that crackers, peanut butter and nutella would make a relatively whole form of such calorie. Bread
            remains a
            good thing, but is better suited for higher metabolic periods. At any rate, soft breads fit well in such
            times, while full ones make do in lesser ones. You may enjoy both in the best of moments, but in our
            current
            scenario, stick to english muffins --which go great with PB n J-- Silver Hills, or Pita --which you can
            cut
            up, preheat(properly), then lightly fry. Further --and this is a loose thought-- making it easier to
            consume
            grain seems paramount, as it is nourishing and filling. Be it with margarine, tomato sauce or butter
            chicken, soup even, ought we make an effort to include this.

            I have some reflections regarding health; with the aim of stearing our baser principles.
            <br>&emsp;For one, we've been inconsistent. Through circumstance sure, and a bit of self-doubt. But more
            or
            less, we've been uneven. As far back as I can remember actually. And in fact, ever since we've started
            doing
            body weight movements, our regularity has been off. For the aim of such motions has been to strengthen
            our
            shoulders and give us rigor and ease. But our physical appearence loses it's brevity, and so we 'move'
            impertenitly. Since we've sat on the floor this slope has only continued to look down. I can point out a
            bevy of periods, or stretches at least, where things were well, and our body was solid and swell. So
            much
            time though has been spent not working out or doing yoga. Looking back at Vancouver, we did do some
            running
            and training, but it was not for long, nor with much grace. I did not feel this cruddiness that I'm
            experiencing now. But that may be because our overall training was much higher. For regularity is about
            the
            pitch of your constance. For we may over the course of several months remain inhabited to exercise, but
            do
            so with ill-regularity; in that we do a couple here, then wait a week, 'out of mistakes and or neglect'
            then
            do it again. While in the recent years, many weeks may go by where we do nothing, and too many months
            where
            this sort of thing is common.
            <br>&emsp;Right now, my fairest observation is that, of all things range of motion, that my body
            relsihes
            having done them. But not so much of what doing them produces, 'as if a sear upon hitting a hot pan';
            but
            rather, in memory, as if some felt effect, that they are done for this to still be experienced. There is
            this point where the form of things whithers away. It comes quick and is hard to revert. But it takes
            time
            for this moment to come about; when it does, I shoudl clarify, is when it comes to be so quickly.
            <br>&emsp;Our ways have always been like this, but I can speak to the proportions of things much better.
            Namely, your training is usually of bouts amidst your free range or running; or sets and or rounds of
            strict
            motions. Doing this latter with no foundation for the former, creates the rigid experience that were
            feeling
            to often. For upon that heartier sequence, we don't have any susbquent lighter and or dynamic
            experience;
            and so the effects of the resitance training sink deeper into me, but unevenly. From the fact that we
            sit on
            the floor, our being as such gets twisted and thwarted, to the effect that we are bearing ourselves to
            be
            upright and comfortable. Yoga fortifies you against this, and, through the course of the day, 'while the
            more permanent effects haven't set in, that so does it even out the dripping effect of gripping. "In
            other
            words, we grip less, and are thwarted less from as much as we do." But the downward pull, or drip, is
            from
            our approach of training, and how commiserate it is to prior and or coming sessions, along with work,
            and
            our balance of eating. Which, of the latter, is to say, that exercising on a parched stomach can create
            it's
            own rigid position, as your body tends to be less ample and light during heartier mtoions. And, by those
            other imbalances, doing such motions in such a way is what brings a sort of heaviness upon us --which
            our
            relation to the floor and yoga bears. But, having eaten little, we may be a earn some heaviness, as does
            doing work or playing games to excess following training. "Though this actually intrudes upon the
            incorporation of the heaviness already produced, rather that contirbuting more." Work, in being
            excessively
            dynamic, with a flavor of rigor and also intersperes akwardness, is weakened the most by too little
            nourishment.

            So, briefly, the idea that your liver stores glycogen, seems like the key to our success; and also
            reason
            for our demise. Metabolically, you use some balance of sugar, fat and oxygen. I reckon, by being
            catabolic,
            unworked, that you use these inappropriately; moreover, you don't intake them as much; for the sugar can
            be
            put into muscles, or liver ---which, in being of excess, may rmeark that dry mouth, where the sugar has
            no
            place to go.
            <br>&emsp;Another thing, is that arugments, perhaps neccesarrily, work from some principle. A theory is
            a
            broader statement, as it takes certain facts and or principles for granted. Of note, is that you may
            speak
            to something less than entirety, and bear facts and or principles with respect to that. For, I may not
            be
            able to speak to entirety, but still take for granted a principle which is more sound and local to a
            'upper
            matter'. "This is how, despite lacking knowledge of cause and effect, that we can still speak about
            ovens as
            if their proported effect of cooking is true; perhaps on a given belief from experience, or, induction,
            as
            such epxeirence have given merrit through what you've observed repeatedly. But, the point, is not that
            were
            contending the nature of the oven; as this rests on their being cause and effect at all. But, as we may
            take
            for granted certain principles or truths to exclaim cause and effect, so are we taking the nature of the
            oven (to cook) to be true, and from that given fact, making claims and or statements about what were
            going
            to do (with cooking)."
            <br>&emsp;Thirdly, I see too much potential in setting up our PWA. Our website is one thing, but setting
            up
            a scripted PDF has too much value, as you can change font, color, size etc. but also have little boxes
            for
            designation. You could pin something as being about family and the past, or violence, religion,
            philosophy,
            judgement and or thinking. Everything may be put somewhere. You may also favorite and or star things, as
            to
            be deemed essnetial, worth a re-read, and even edit. Practically, you can have a little button above
            each
            piece, and let that toggle a little bar, full of boxes which you check. All we need to do content wise,
            is
            put everything within tags, put the toggle bar, and bobs your uncle. I did find, from VS purely, that we
            beenfited by putting 'notes' --which are things about work and or eating, which are not worth reading--
            in
            their own file. And indeed, keeping these hear in our PWA list, may ruin some of the flow; which tends
            to
            happen, or has at least, when going over a piece onto the next. Though, the primary cause of this is in
            the
            act of scrolling, and needing to be caught by something, rather than imparting your interest, which all
            things apply. Directing the 'notes' to their place, and then reading them or not, 'as everything being
            ordered gives a semblence of, 'why not'',' may make things work smoothly, without the need of a prior
            pass
            --to put such notes in their own list.

            So a quick remark of our leisuruley finance. Scooter is coming, and old one is good for a patch. This
            has
            used much of our spending money; as there is much joy and utility in being able to ride, and on these
            solid
            tires.
            <br>&emsp;Our computer is generally off. It seemed to have been fixed by undervolting; but launching
            Aliens
            reset it. Only once mind you; and I do recall this happening with Starfield. We'll try launching it more
            times --we've got the new driver. The maple ridge guy said he'd service it for free (to diagnose);
            though, I
            can't imagine there is any usesfull information besides needing an upgrade. We may look into setting
            games/clients for gpu usage. We may also understadnd undervolting and min. frequevcny, and whether these
            change per games.
            <br>&emsp;I will be a little sad if Red Dead can't be played. But alas, Ark is on PS5 and all mighty for
            it.
            BF1 remains a humbling classic, as is 4 and 5 a common good. There appears less online we can play with
            Matt, but alas, Ark and BF are there. Diablo is kind of an indulgence; and wasn't an issue with
            undervolting. Borderlands 4 comes early Septemebr, and Battleifeld a few weeks after that, on PS5. Our
            pc
            functions fine besides that. Similar to our scooter, if we find the interest, we'll put a 100$ in cede
            the
            issue; but otherwise, make use of it as we good and fit. Andor season 1 is prime, as is Rogue One.
            Conferences are coming next week, along with Ragnorak --which i cannot wait to play on official servers.
            We
            have tons of games on PS5, namely Jurassic Evolution, Aliens, Jedi Survivor on ps extra, doom, and
            honestly,
            a bunch of other cool games, Ghost of Tushima director cut, more Fallout 76 (which wasn't too good
            online,
            but great for me, exploring,), need for speed hot pursuit (which, again, is like one of those things
            which
            is cool to download because you own it, and play a bit), and mafia similar to that, dead space,
            collisto,
            little nightmares (which is suppose to be easy and fun), Tombraider (which we've been meaning to play)

            I'm a bit overwhelmed with the prospect of problem solving; what I am never tired for, is in embalming
            myself with the guide of reason.
            <br>&emsp;I may be discontent about our pc, 'acting up again'. Nor am I terribly proud, or at least
            assured,
            in our purchase of another scooter; and speaking about it is often unbecoming our reasoning for doing
            so.
            <br>&emsp;But of this dissuasion, we need not fret. Yes the problem remains, but, beyond the fact that
            you
            can bear it, so can you more readily adopt an appreciation for all else that you have. "Only children
            pout
            and cry when one of their toys break, forgetting that they have so much other."
            <br>&emsp;All things console are free and pure. Even if the 5 broke, we have a ps4 --and this would be
            relataively cheap to replace. Ark is played better on console, for it is easy to boot up; and it being
            ascended --which has natural struggles on pc-- makes for the best experience. Red Dead may or may not
            work,
            so be it. I will let it sit there as a marvel to come. A bit far away, but a remaster may come for
            console.
            And despite lacking mods, you could still play console; and give emphasis to the story. Or take your
            hunting
            seriously. Theres some time and place to do that. There is more or less a laundry list of games. Bf 1
            remains true, 2042 is novel and fun, and 5 and 4 compare. Soon, Borderlands and Bf6 will be out. And
            Matt
            finds an easy interest in games, so were going to play Borderlands 1 --which will be fun and
            delightfull,
            and perhaps worth another investment into 2. As it were, Civ is no longer an interest: were full on it.
            And
            diablo is a bit of an indulgence, and not something which I care too much about. Forget about the event:
            Ragnorak is coming. And the next season many weeks away.
            <br>&emsp;I would find much delight to eat well and enough tomorrow; to do a morning stretch, breifly
            standing and the table to down dog. Working on the reamining videos would marble our day. If we have
            time,
            I'd like to workshop the PWA. And there is much to easily read from our current charter. Mammals is
            almost
            done: and I am so glad to have gotten even a bit more out of this fantastic soundtrack. "Heists, Whale
            Nursery and Master of Heat being great additions." I am looking to move onto Planet Earth 3, and with
            mammals, look for some slow downs, or speed ups. The key is continuity, as connecting different paces is
            off. Master of Heat for instance simply sounds good at all lower levels; while there are short bits
            which
            bear more value in being extended. "Similar to Mammals title." I'd say were in the red zone with our
            scooter; but we may take it easily down Ford or Harris, and to Pitt. Come straight at the bumps, and go
            slow
            over the two divets near Hammond ---which I would take, for PMSS is quite gruddy.

            I've been thinking for a while about this idea of formation, or moulding substance. By that, I wonder
            what
            it means for us, to mould ourselves through writing, even if our current state is one of weariness and
            rigidity. "Tis some rough clay."
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, I see clearly that the lifts video is hard to come by. I have no problem
            blending,
            nor doing a bit of prep, in terms of how to start and begin. Its nature is to form our lifts, and so,
            how it
            begins and ends is not an issue. I'll bring in another point, that I sought to do some editing today,
            and
            despite doing so, I am not compelled to do a ton. From that, I see the value in things just being what
            they
            are, and being complete as they can be; without over doing ourselves. Lifts can come tomorrow or
            Wedensday
            --which is itself a great day, considering its relation to now-- but until then, and even when that more
            concentrated moment happens, just let the video be, suitable in its form, and subject to later editing,
            or
            reconstruction: but from a known sort.
            <br>&emsp;Tomorrow, or the day next, were going to do a mighty pushup session. Were modifying the pose
            as to
            do more; namely in lowering to our knees. Volume is the anwser, especially in or lower degree. For the
            session, my sense is that four doubles is possible. Drop onto your knees, push, come up and rest, then
            drop
            again, then recover, drop, pause and drop again: this is your superset ---which is to say, two doubles.
            From
            here, recovery and recuperate, then repeat. The point is to keep your form, do lots of repitions, but
            not
            grind through your elbows or shoulders. TableDog is a great monring video, as are easyHero and
            proneSupine
            nice additions throughout the day. FullBack and SupineStaff are more tertiary, and likely in the midday
            when
            you need to rest; while cowCobble is pretty solid for firm and upright recovery; while HeroFeet is
            pretty
            good for restoring yourself (as you mend your feet). As of now, besides our lifts and flows, we'd gain
            much
            from a leg session; namely of runners lung, quad stretch, and some other hip and or staff work. We'd
            benefit
            much from arms and neck stretches; particularly in order to recover from work or training. And albeit
            great
            for the monring, a pure standing and or folding sequence would compliment tableDog. I'm thinking an arm
            swooshing flow, up and down several times, ending with a longer hold and rise --- the end of tabledog
            has
            that lovely arm cross and stretch, which is great for all endings.

            So, I can't speak to all things, but, I have seen that there is a clear point in the day where the sun
            is
            relatively high, but a bit dipped, yet still prior to evening. There is a warm glow to things, yet full
            on
            shine. This, more or less, is the afternoon; and the later you can wait, the richer it gets.
            <br>&emsp;I am aware though that this sort of thing only comes in the middle portion of the year; as
            during
            the shorter months, the sun goes quickly from midday to evening. In terms of time, one can go out at
            5pm,
            and still come back, rest and have dinner, then go back out for a 9pm sunset. At least, the evening glow
            is
            around that; and too, the dark blue around 10. I think that we can take our scooter on the road, and
            mitigate any night riding concerns. We do this generally around pitt, so why not down harris and old
            dewdney. Grab your lights, and be aware of cars behind. There ought not be many, and its a quick moment
            to

            I don't take pleasure in having to stear our direction. We had sent our mom and dad a letter, exclaiming
            the
            need for health. This remains true; but what we had in mind there, has shifted. I feel the beenfit from
            working out concentradely; and I also see how it is permissable through yoga. But I don't feel great.
            Nor do
            I think this entirely from our shortcomings of yoga. Were too absent of aerobics and free range. Yes,
            our
            stability would serve us, as would more restoration. But to the end that, upon our workout, we would be
            more
            able to do nothing, 'as it bade us do'.
            <br>&emsp;What needs to happen is that we need to prioritize that primary motion of the day; be it
            warrior,
            deep stretch, free range and or a mix of aerobics, or full range. Of the latter, it is clear that you
            benefit from volume; and this can be achieved by altering your position. Knee pushups are a clear
            example.
            Side squats are great, as you adjust your footing each time. Pulling though remains a mystery; for it is
            generally tougher, and hard to adjust. It is paramount then, that you use proper gloves (if needed) and
            have
            the proper footing to begin your motion. Otherwise, let your restoration and stability bring you through
            the
            days, and free range and aerobics give life to this. Do your pushups and squats in tandum with that, and
            in
            a way that is proper for them. We ought do some lifts at any rate; and our judgement of proper pushing
            may
            bound from that.

            Here are the facts as I know them.
            <br>&emsp;Having someone put a single tubeless tire on is 50$, 100$ for solid. The cost of each tire is
            around 50$.
            <br>&emsp;From VMAX, the guarteneed proper tire is that price, but is literally 70$ to ship. And that is
            american, so its more like 130 x 1.3 = 180. Which is ridiculous. I've emailed them, and they may or may
            not
            give me a discount for the tire (a coupon, as they've offered before). But near 100$ cad to ship it is
            absurd, and makes this not much of an option.
            <br>&emsp;Also, putting a solid tire on my scooter has always unnerved me. Mostly because the fit of it
            may
            be off. They have some with the right dimensions --from Amazaon, they have no solids from VMAX. But the
            thickness of it worries me. And its 150$, and still leaves the front tire unsolid. The value of solids
            is
            you can go out at night without concern; and the same down more precarious roads, or to other cities. If
            I
            still have a non solid up front, then having one in the back doesn't mean much. I might as well have non
            solid for both, and ride with respect to that.
            <br>&emsp;This leaves me then with the possibility that the rim is damaged, which makes any tire
            unusable.
            Or, we do as you say and put a tube in there. This brings a huge issue with it though, in that, if it
            gets
            popped, you have to get someone to take it off and put it back on so you can patch it up. If the bead
            was
            properly seated, I would just rely on plugs. Maybe the tube is protected from smaller punctures, and is
            thus
            not an issue.
            <br>&emsp;Also, about rounded tires, the one's from vmax are the same as the one I bought: flat. The
            tire I
            had looked as flat as mine does now (when it did not have air). I see on Amazon that there are such
            tires
            which look rounded; I just don't see how my old one was such, and thus, I don't think the tire was an
            issue.
            I don't see how it being roudned or not determines if it fits on the rim properly. Even if it does, this
            new
            one didn't seem to fit improperly but for that one spot. And the issue there may be chocked up to damage
            on
            the rim.
            <br>&emsp;In terms of new scooters, I see that the 400$ is more than I even need. I can get one for 300
            that
            goes slightly less fast, has a smaller battery, but is similar otherwise. There's value in that battery
            though. At any rate, having solid tires has good value, period. I am totally on board for selling
            scooter,
            but the tire must be fixed. If the rim is damaged, then theres nothing to be done. If the tire was the
            issue, maybe it can be adjusted; or I'll have to look into a proper tire.

            I ordered a e scooter recently. Its performance has been relatively sub par. I've only ridden it once,
            but
            it did not go as fast as advertised. I was looking through the user manual though, and it mentioned that
            to
            be eligble for a return, there could be no more than 10 miles on the odometer. For one, you can't see
            the
            odmoeter. But, my question to you, is such a qualification applicable if I am returning it to amazon.
            The
            product is not sold through amazon mind you; though I have been reassuered (in prior conversations) that
            Amazon will reinburse me for any return costs (issued by the seller). Which, to be clear, is on Amazon,
            but
            sold/shipped from another seller. I am just unclear whether that fact about ridig it to a limited extent
            applies in said sellers return process (in relation to Amazon). As it may only apply if you bought the
            product through their own website.
            <br>&emsp;Here is a link to the product:

            So the hero session served me well, but has been set aside into the realm of full back and supine. The
            reason being, that the staff pose and leg raise remove it as a sort of 'quick sesh'.
            <br>&emsp;On that note, I would seperate our sessions into those which you do on a whim, likely for the
            interest of unwinding and or breathing. Easy Hero or Cobbler come to mind; things which you could do as
            many
            times during the day; and with not stakes but for the result of doing them. Others are of a more
            deliberate
            sort. These are you supines and or deep stretches; things you may in all fairness elect to do, but more
            than
            liely end up being things for when you have nothign but thus wish for somethign large; or there more
            particularly made, and done so with a certain end in mind, such as lifts or neck stretch.
            <br>&emsp;By the advent of our system, we need not worry about classifying things. Certain ones do get
            put
            into that less than often side, but we recall where they are, all while they sit there accessible and
            clear
            if and when we want them.
            <br>&emsp;Most things need a trimming or edit. Hero for instance, would be fine if it weren't for leg
            raise.
            Prone and supine are fairly swell, but the object of the pairing is not fully realized; the prone should
            be
            slightly simpler, and the supine should more easily become so. TableDog is a prime example here, as I
            don't
            think it beenfits from two rounds of downward dog. Its better to shorten the intial table top, maybe
            join in
            some motion, then go to dowanrd dog and prone --let it be that though. You may add a proper rise, or
            just
            leave this for what it is, as a sort of easy shoulder/lift session, and build a proper standing routine.
            HeroFeet is similar, in that it is structurally swell, but could be trimmed down. FullBack needs a
            section
            removed, as is supineStaff untended. These ought have crucial matters tended to; but for all their
            worth,
            they sit nicely as a basis for us, when we have nothing but little to do.
            <br>&emsp;I will note the essential edits of mere flow and sun salutation. Getting to them would be
            preferred in the latter, and lengthening the time in lunges for the former. Also, in each, give time for
            proper pauses during folds and rises; and give a generous hold near the end.
            <br>&emsp;Besides that, the two easiest sessions are mountain and squating. For the latter, I think it
            would
            be so beneficial to hold three deep squats. We can use any channel; perhaps some indian. We may do it
            often
            and simply. For moutnain, I want a more active rise, beginning with several arm raises, then into fold,
            with
            a deep hold, then up again firmly, with arm stretches and things of the sort. I realize there is not
            alot of
            actual folding, but I prefer the motion on both ends than the actual drop or rise.
            <br>&emsp;Lifts might be our most wortwhile and custom job. How we begin may be simple, as we have
            nothing
            but bold intentions. Though a version of this that is akin to flow, in that you may want to breezily do
            this, compared to a more lengthy and deliberate session. The aim is not so much to hold things, as this
            can
            be difficult, buy rather to go through the chaturanga movement several times. I dare say, that a full
            session would include a pause and rest, and into another round, ended with cobbler. Lifts are amongst
            our
            weakest points, and effect our ability to work and train. So having an easy and serious session is
            paramount

            People worry about you, and perhaps for good reason. But, of the things relevant to me, or important
            rather
            within such judgement, so is this often poorly respected.
            <br>&emsp;All I'll say, is of my problems, it comes down to the merriment of good pace, contrasted with
            the
            opposite begruderies and glimmness, as comes from a poor pace.
            <br>&emsp;As regards my choices in life, so that our pace, be it full or flat, has some end, or
            direction in
            mind, so is this ultiamtley my own. And it is not poor to mention that the nature of our pace effects
            this;
            as being idle tends not to produce future thought.
            <br>&emsp;At any rate, my scooter is in perril. But, in effect, we are on route to fixing it and making
            it
            amiable. The primary concern is in fact our Jaison scooter, as the return is not endeliably acceptable.
            I do
            mean to keep the large matt, but the blue one must be returned prior to the fifht --which is coming up.
            Our
            credit card situation is more or less an issue, but only because we are more accountable for what we
            buy. If
            dad pays for the scooter, then we'll accept the amazon mistake. Otherwise, we'll ask for comupins.

            So, we are given much, in the way of things that we would otherwise provide for ourselves: namely food
            and
            bed.
            <br>&emsp;Now, the question is, what is responsabile, or fair at least for someone to do if they are
            recieving such things? For it is not practical that they'd live as though this were always the case.
            Nor, in
            doing so, are they benefiting much; as living like kids do is not much of avenue for great living.
            Moreover,
            your actually hurting yourself; for it is not reasonable, in what you plainly desire, to be without
            social
            interaction. Worth noting is the fact that most people are not given such provisions and thus employ
            themselves, with desires and cares rooted by that. And as such, many of the folk who you would convene
            with,
            will be uncomparable to you, in that you are not employed.
            <br>&emsp;But when we come down to it, it is never ok to live as a child, even if your needs are met. My
            experience doing so has been one where, in claiming so, that it was such because of our behaviour and
            choices. For we were not thwarted in being provided for if we behaved well, and lived un-vain. Further
            though, we perosnally came to see that, with all being provided, that we still lacked friends and
            occupation. Employing ourselves then, when there was no pecuniary need, still provided something we felt
            was
            absent. The question then, is how much ought one do if they are given privalage. For in fairness, all
            motives for this concern come from some view of the future and how, as in all actions, what the effect
            will
            be when the future becomes now. Out of desire and need, and perhaps discipline as to exhort this --by
            those
            who'd otherwise provide-- you are more or less going to be on your own, providing for youself. And so,
            in
            being given things now, you are not well fit for such life since the actions imbued to it are barren
            now.
            There is a sentiment of 'feeling the burden', as if the work you did had stakes; along with the sense of
            apprectiation of things, when such work is required. But I believe this senitment false, and lives
            beyond
            the our main point. Which is, in what you can expect, and how those who provide also look out for the
            fact
            that such deeds will be yours, that it is only fair that such privalge be given rightly, if such future
            is
            not tarnished in the process. "We ought be as we would without privalge, so what is given is not at the
            cost
            of inability upon it lacking."
            <br>&emsp;The point then, is that we have moved to Pitt Meadows and are employed at Superstore. Our
            leisure
            is constrained to our bedroom walls and our relations with people is merely college like. But our angst
            about speaking is gone. "I've noticed more of an issue with my eyes; from poor cardio potentially." I
            care
            not to move, in the way that I did before, with exotic envy and or fear, 'of living here, being normal,
            ceasing our quest for posterity and fame'. Despite our health being a little poor in the aerobics, our
            yoga
            has never been better, as has our general movement been fine. Were just a bit to head down in our own
            efforts, 'letting the more filled out position come later'.

            On a practical note, I am trying to make a pdf website, or editing browser, so that I may input my
            writings,
            and cateogrize them as special or of a certain kind --philo, life, reflections, joy, world-- and also
            give
            them a name. It would be so great if we could use notepad to wrap each piece in proper text, then have
            an
            input box which would make that piece's id labelled as I input. Perhaps it will just save the title, and
            we'll have to input it manually; which is as simple as 'finding' said spot, and pasting the title there
            into
            the div. It might be worth noting, that all of these notes are best put at the end of a piece, seeing as
            you
            are going to judge following reading. But, at the top, have a label which shows the title inputed at the

            reverted
            this, though similar behavior happened with Aliens and Red Dead. It may be a serious issue, or maybe it
            was
            from something else. Witcher may be a problem also, but I see the benefit from playing Ark and Jedi,
            merely
            booting them up, that the slight drop in quality is but a minor concern. In many ways, the PS5 version
            looks
            good enough --and it is ultiamtley the world which i seek. Similarly, in the case for Red Dead, we could
            priortize the story; and otherwise roleplay with hunting by treking around the fur traders. We may also
            minimzie any exhorbident rewards, as to warrant finer efforts.
            <br>&emsp;Our credit card is techincally charging us 50$ a year. PS remains an indedted fund, similar to
            Mobile. It is about 5$ to get extra, and Jedi has been more than fine. I wish to find more fun in
            Descent,
            but were still learning what to do. Evolution is similar, though the setting is not so gripping.
            <br>&emsp;Andor remains, as does Clone Wars. Seinfeld perhaps lingers, while Life With Derek is a
            splendid
            surprsie, along with Boogie.

            The two main sessions were missing is standing and legs. For one, I am thinking of the outside vid,
            where
            she opens her arms up high several times, then folds ---we can just add that excellent rise and arm
            stretch.
            Leg wise, we ought do staff twist and supine stretches. There are many of the former, and the latter
            needs
            only formatting. We can also find a resting version of this, where we substitue the staff for prone,
            then
            spend more deliberate time on our back. In fact, our current prone supine --which we edited-- needs to
            upload.
            <br>&emsp;Were missing a neck stretch. Which is one of those things, where skipping it, makes your
            coming
            bounds less ideal; and hard to amend, 'as you've already settled into your mould'. This can be the red
            pant
            vid, with hands out followed by rotations. You can also do simple arm raise to twist then fold --while
            seated-- and do your neck following.
            <br>&emsp;I feel that our aerobics is lacking. Having a soccerball would be nicest, as it is engaging
            without being querrky. Jump rope is a bit like that. Skipping is fine, but can be a little loofy.
            Running in
            spot is a fair accompaniment; but running feels the best. Give yourself time though to do this, and let
            your
            recovery occur from workouts. Doing your stretches alleviates your uneven motion. Without our scooter,
            we
            have no other option, but free range at home. Our soccer ball is flat, and jump rope is a bit to
            awkward.
            <br>&emsp;Quickly, we might extend our lunges and add a later hold for our mereFlow ---along with giving
            a
            fair pause after each fold. This is something easy and done often, which is a benefit while were not
            doing
            any full range. Similar to our neck work, in that it better strenghtens the mould to come, so would a
            more
            concentrated lift session contribute similar strenght. But for now, legs, neck/seated, standing, updated
            flow, mereSupine, and uploading our proneSupine, would suffice.

            I have spent much time remarking upon the Humian notion of mind. I see how there is much in regards to
            thoughts which we may apply. For our idea of a thought, or sense at least, contains properties which are
            farily deemed of a real sort. For what gives the material of our thought its form or substance? Is there
            color, shape or some other quality. Such properties hold within them a physical basis; at least, when
            were
            describing things in real life. So why should such elements not be equally remarked upon in our mind.
            Why we
            are thinking of colors, and more than likely other propertiees to, is one thing; but it seems true and
            fair
            to explain the imagery of such color as one would to it in reality. "Would my concept of mixing blue and
            yellow not create green?"
            <br>&emsp;I find that liberty has a retched mother; one who nags him if he is not honest or fair.
            Simply, we
            are remissed upon our freedoms to realize that others are not so well off. But the matter of fact is,
            that
            when we are in fact solid and true, that we don't get warped into such concepts, and rather let the
            mystery
            of other peoples experience be what they may. Consquently, our own calm and tender flow of experience,
            moulds what we'd imagine the basis for other folks experiences are. "Not that they would receive certain
            impressions, or be affected rather this or that way; but that, of whatever came in, from ectasy to
            gratuity,
            so would it be imparted onto to the vessicle we know: our own mind and fortuity fairs the backdrop by
            which
            others will experience things." It is a shame that we often see others at their lowest; or worse, we see
            something which is in fact novel, or a slight garnish to their otherwise selves, but we then percieve
            them
            as that fully: which is a pithy view on our part. It is true that people suffer, be it in poverty or
            pestulence. But they are people after all; and even if young or foolish, so is there humanity in them.
            "Not
            the least of these accolades is the dissimenation of pain, as produced under the victims moral cause.
            E.g,
            soldiers who are shot, stabbed, obliterated in the torso or limb, even those executed in strict fashion;
            so
            are these men endlessly accounted for as being stout, calm, and despite any enduring pain, fine. 'Not a
            sound or a whimper', the surgeon said, as she remarked upon the treatment center; literal pieces of
            shrapnel
            being pulled out of folks side, and the room was silent. Such are the halls of humanity."
            <br>&emsp;There is a shiny side of this though. For on route to liberty, there may be an untimely
            demise, or
            guarenteed one at that. And this is perhpas the soul thorn in our positive side: for such matters are
            hard
            to conceive properly, and thus rightly consiliate. But, aside from such things, 'in the evening of our
            remorse,' we can exhibit the genuine virtue which removes us personally from such despair. For it is one
            thing to sympathize amidst other peoples squeels; and another for your own. But such risk, or
            precariousness
            in which you may be spurn to such, is one that virtue fortifies one against. As Seneca says, 'those who
            thrown up their hands, often get them cut off; while the will of man is never immutable from offering
            his
            throat: in which his subjection is to times mere demand'. Marbling that concept with the simplest of
            ease,
            makes one's entry unremitting, and thus an indeulable option for one who'd choose it --and not, by its
            defintiion, with any comparable remorse.
            <br>&emsp;The slowness of life, the rot of imagery which our pithy impressions and judgements produce,
            balance our sensibilities out when properly considered. And as such, although I may not entirely know
            their
            pain and suffering, so am I unprivy to any laudible conception of villany or evil. And as such, people
            are
            at worse subject to the trauma of (ordinary) combative operations; and at best, to some extent grazed,
            or at
            least unobliterated. "For which many account for in their bouts of bravery, e.g, 'I did not even realize
            that I'd been hit', or, 'not till some time had gone by did it begin feeling awful'." Most of us would
            seemingly imagine that it was upon entry that the atrocity happened. But it is more often than not what
            lingers --rather than what so cerimoiously occured (ie. the hit). It is not worth overlooking the
            enormous
            kindness, comradery and more or less geniality between all folk: combatatns or not. To those shattered
            thighs or perferated bowls, know that there is no God to aid you, but the hands of man: for which there
            are
            many on all sides. Moreover, the civil operations surrounding such matters are not filled with anything
            but
            gentleman. Their ideas may be archaic and or inflated, but they are men, operating on the day to day
            correspondances in which their position reflects. "I ought say more, but, more or less, as the
            beligerents
            are merely operative by their own national decree, yet are not then of evil and villany, so are those,
            in
            perpetration and defense, any more evil or ludicrous: such sentiments pithily reflect the true and
            continual
            actions of each and every man. " And we ought blame nature for leading us to modernity from primitive
            times;
            where culture and relations could so 'un-modernly' procure.
            <br>&emsp;I understand war and bigotry then through some antrhopolgical sense. I consiliate myself by
            rounding off any pitiful and or slack edges. I also impermiate myself from any abscence of mans
            fidelity:
            being strictly devout to their actual nature and happening. "I ought clearly knwo and see there true
            strenght during pain, and their geniality in dealing it." Such sides are but foriegn strides: in history
            and
            destination. While I sit here, endeared to death, pleased to meet it, and as such indifferent in
            distress,
            nor so gripped and or bethrothed to whatever one may take: I let them take all the things but what I
            care
            for; nor do I flinch when I am asked to be a part of their employment. "Time never offered me anything
            but a
            delayed corporal blade. As Socrates, 'release me now'."

            So I don't forget, there is a clear solution for our website. Simply, we need a lower left button which
            triggers a modal. This modal will speak for whichever piece is loaded; or in the case of our pdf
            (editing),
            so will there be a checkbox that, when clicked, marks said div for the modal. This may be applied to
            present
            pieces also.
            <br>&emsp;The modal will have a grand star, as to attribute generaly great pieces, and mild stars, as to
            attribute great pieces within a section. Such sections will be Philo, as remarks our linens and doubt,
            the
            World, as remarks civil exploration and begrudgrment, minor sections such as violence or Civ, Life,
            which
            remarks eating and work, and Joy, which holds our sentiment of principle and living. What's more, you
            can
            assign a piece to multiple sections. You may have a treatment of joy, but in less reflective manner, but
            of
            principle, and this may hold both categories of Philo and Joy. The point being, that instead having a
            section for 'joy and philo', you simply assign pieces the cateogires that fit them. Then, you may recall
            pieces that fit those arrangment of categories. It should be though, that, in this pieces case, that
            because
            it is in philo and Joy, that it not also be in Philo by itself. Only when you select philo and joy will
            you
            see it. Perhaps this may be an option --where you can have all pieces attached to a type, or only those
            of
            such type but no other.
            <br>&emsp;Of note, if your looking for all pieces on Civ, assume you can find them in your files. Copy
            and
            paste there Ids --which their titles are already associated with, or would be in the index file. Then
            put a
            sign next to this in Notepad, and put each of them in the proper div strucutre --using find and repalce.

            So I woke up today, and all was generally well. I got to work, taped my screen, and worked rather well
            through the first two runs. I had some trailmix, then after a short run, went on a break. I failed to
            eat
            more after this, and during my next run, I was quite hungry. I ate, and this solved the issue.
            <br>&emsp;I had ran yesterday, and all was well. But I noticed that my neck was rather straight; and I
            could
            feel this during my shift.
            <br>&emsp;Our sleep was more or less fine, having walked and done some proneSupine. "Our breathing was

            better
            advised that you go to bed around 11, and strive to wake up around 7. This may naturally change as your
            shifts happen earlier. But for now, going to bed 7 hours prior, or turning everything off, is fair.
            Also,
            make sure everything is done, in terms of prep, so you don't have to come and go and see lights.

            This idea, of being reaosnable, comes from this inherent sense that were conditioned; and similar to
            one,
            who knows there bank account, and however desirable a purcahse would be, they feel rot, 'and perhaps
            shame',
            and spending money they did not freely have.
            <br>&emsp;THis is why virtue is exclaimed as good in itself; for surrounding all of us is some extent of
            a
            condition; and thus, as if a flame that never ceased its heat, so are our actions which mend that, 'and
            for
            our better', pleasing. "As if we knew the harvest was coming, and were pleased to be on route for good
            picking."

            our conciliation to its labor akin to virtue; in that our actions, as experienced and foreseen, are calm
            and
            plenty.
            <br>&emsp;But on this path, there is a portion of complacency. For I do not see perfection outside our
            door;
            but merely a constant progress to that harmony. We know that certain yoga positions would be alright;
            and
            that if these were hear, our time gaming would naturally be put aside and returned to in proper amounts.
            "Of
            these chains, it is a nice feeling to see that they will feel lighter, and us stronger. These little
            meddleys of experience which I deam rich, only seem more bright and near, and often."

            It is reasonable that if we were to sustain ourselves, that we'd pay est. 700, and the remaining on
            food. We
            tend to budget, 'by times evening', some 300 for that. I see no reason then why we shouldn't account for
            things in our current situation equally.
            <br>&emsp;The purpose of this runs on the fact that we eat a variety of foods. Their prescence need not
            be
            constant, but regular. As one thing ceases, the medley of others take its place. "And the regularity
            allows
            for enough overlap, as to make every moment sufficeint."
            <br>&emsp;Milk for instance, is given favor via a single glass. This makes a Silk carton worth a week,
            and
            thus 15-20$ a month. This does not count Soy for smoothies; which does not use so much, and can be
            scaled at
            that. Smoothies are relatively high on price, and so for our current pruposes, we can presume the use of
            Soy, and our own drinking milk. 1 per week will do
            <br>&emsp;Next is dried fruit, which, for our purposes, amounts to less-sugar cranberries. We use these
            in
            our trailmix and during the day. "Similar to protein, when we seek energy, but are prior to smoothies;
            or
            dinner." These cost 3$ normally, but can be gotten in extreme bulk for 2.50. The bags are not large, and
            accounting for our trailmix is not unimportant. But, considering that you have a handfull or two a day,
            and
            a bag offers many of such, so is two per week a good estimate. At worst, this is 24$ a month, or 20 if
            you
            get on sale. Given the likely less than more amounts used, we can estaime on the lower end. "As you may
            only
            have 3 after two weeks, lowering the mean."
            <br>&emsp;Third is protein. Tihs is a tricky one, as our exericse brings us to certain need. But,
            generally,
            the kinds of protein are limited, or at least few in kind, and so the choice is not so varied by
            circusmtance. Simply, you have soy, which is bought in frozen bags; 3$ on sale, or around 2 at certain
            stores. Tofu is a fair choice, 700g for 3$, or 450 for 2. Tuna is 1.25$ per can, meaning about 75 cents
            per
            serving. Sardines are equal, though better kinds are closer to 2$. These are quite delicious, though
            they
            only count as 1 serving. Tuna is about 120g while Sardines are a third less, all for about 50 more in
            price. "Tis a privalged delight." Tuna is quite harsh though and not easy to enjoy. The use of oil, salt
            and pepper makes this habitable; the use of margarine, or more precise blends of said spices may make it
            more pleasing.
            At any rate, protein has its place in the afternoon, following worn days or past workouts. Likewise,
            following workouts,
            you may find points following your smoothie/fruit where you want some extra protein, 'added to your
            grain perhaps'. I
            must admitt that although sardines are rather oily and fine, Tuna is rather rough and not all to
            'refreshing'. The
            acidity, or at least bend of the protein from these is greater than that of Soy; and despite any
            misgivings or concern,
            the consquences are not so entirely noticble. I tend to notice that my need for protein, if it be beyond
            mere interest,
            that such moments warrant the more acidic protein; in fact I seek that. The lack of ill that comes, and
            the kind of want
            which points me towards it, eases me in both percieved effects and principle.

            So, 6 hours is paramount on a workday, plus the given half hour to brush, walk and rest. On non work
            days
            though, or those you start late, you may add another period, making 7.5, plus the given half.
            <br>&emsp;For 6am shifts, considering your up at 530, you more or less need to turn things off at 11.
            This
            is fine, but you could add another chunk but turning things off at 10. This is actually fine, and not
            much
            of a worry. "Delay your eating and gaming though." For a 5 and 4 shift, being up at 430 and 330
            respectively, you need to turn off at 10 and 9 respectively. This latter is rather tough, but you can
            give
            yourself a little less room. Though, if all else is well, it is no hard to ask to have dinner between 6
            and
            8, then turn things off at 9, and go for a walk. 930-330 is doable.
            <br>&emsp;Now, on off days, we give ourselves a proper 8 hour block, for a 7.5 hour shift. I am not
            against
            giving more periods, but you ought not stay up as late. Generally, if your down for 8, it seems so
            fairly
            ideal that you'd turn off around 11 --as you would on a 6:00 shift. This makes for consistency. The idea
            that 6 hours is fine on a worknight makes these shifts very unimposing, as 11 is no harsh time to turn
            in.
            And honestly, it is not much an issue for off nights also. Truly, you may have more leninance with
            gaming
            and food, as you can 'color outwside the lines'. But having some sort of threshold for off nights makes
            all
            things better. For, given the extra sleep, your still up at 7, which makes going to bed at 9 even no
            hassle.
            At any rate, you could a) have a normal 6 hour at 11, or stay up longer, which is not ideal.

            So we've spent all this time, as it were, being reasonable. To which end? Well I can detail the most
            lovely
            of times, in both flavor and constance. Yet I always find myself, like a gardner, merely rewarded with
            the
            chance to plant again; never really finding my place. At least, beyond my means to plant.
            <br>&emsp;My time has never been so devoted, in the dedicative sense. But our amends to reason, or
            living
            deliberately, has no determined end. The point may be of our state of being, in quality that is. And as
            regards money and sources of pleasure, so is this mere preference; as some may prefer higher highs and
            thereby lower lows; while some prefer a more even yet steady pace.
            <br>&emsp;In some sense, this direction is not so obviously false; or at least poignant as the clear,
            and
            perhaps only purpose in mind. There is a but however, and I have in all my years not been able to
            satisfy.
            <br>&emsp;My theory is that in our self regard, we tend to see things accordingly. "From steady grounds
            that
            is." And like one who sees this and is impressed to some end, 'be it attraction or repulsion', so do we
            see
            things from our own steadyness. And one of the objects in sight is that of the world, the rungs of
            history,
            the spits and spats of culture; exotic ends even or luxurious garments, 'tickling our indulgent like'.
            As
            such, my thought has always been that our idea of the future, 'or purpose rather', is one that is always
            being acted on; as, unevenly or not, and far ahead or nearby, we are acting somehow or other. In the
            basic
            sense even, we have personal amends that wilter through the day, or seasonal things, as may remark a
            developing friction in our family. And the point, is that be it near or far, personal or of all
            humanity,
            that we are drawn, directed and with action. What I mean by reason, or living as such, is that we give
            some
            sort of structure to this 'impressionability', or at least fashioning to our array of intakes and
            judgement.
            "For we may be wrong, or holding past judgements that are not either true or rightly applied in a given
            case. And instead of questioning the world every time we take a step, we'd rather spend time thinking
            about
            in more appropriate times, whereupon the need of it, we have a formed anwser."
            <br>&emsp;This is indeed our progressive model. For we have no real end in sight, merely what were
            attending
            to now. The sentiment which we are likely referring to, 'in our doubtlfull quibling', is in the extent
            to
            which we attend certain things. "As some focus on how they'll act during the current harvest, while some
            plan for longer winters ahead." And in that sense, I have no shortcomings of strucutre, which is to say
            reason, regarding the world as it pertains to objective farther than the present. For I don't strongly
            believe there is a willfull, or at least benevalent govenor, or one who acts but with indifference. I
            don't
            find much motive nor cause for salvation; nor, in remarking upon a mere requisite, am I against, or even
            without comfort, in an otherwise elected alternative. I don't feel the timely press of goverence, in
            autocracy even. Nor do I feel that our everyday labor and bits are naturally poor, nor so outstanding
            when
            we consider our abilities, and rational need. "Where a little for me and all is enough."
            <br>&emsp;When I think then of why we live from reason, it is those garnished robes and desire born from
            its
            conquest; the marvel and granduer which it ingratiates me with; the sweet and savory freshness which it
            gives to the world and such around. Nor, in our fairest admittence, that of the just, or at least
            antrhopilical meaningfull duty nature's placed upon us, do I see, or observe even in others, much
            begrudgnig
            ardor or plight. "And indeed, happiness being the cease of rot and worry, so in life and all her
            demands,
            our unburdened afair with such makes for an accordingly sizeable ease: for not nature's tighest hand
            squeezes me."
            <br>&emsp;This is the difference perhaps, of our remarks regarding life being but a mere allotment of
            prefence. "And wisdom being but a tempering of those inexhasutible delights." I think things other. For,
            when we are sitting here, considering things as such, 'of such allotment', we are acting as though there
            is
            no task upon us, nothing which we are bound to feel pain from. Wisdom indeed tempers us, but also
            reminds us
            of the common efforts required. These things being true make it so our care in life is not merely to
            balance
            out our pleasurable account, but more neccesarily rest and see from our unburneded grounds. That is, in
            dealing with our deeds happily, so are we settled and inured, 'rather than openly free, and merely
            plotting
            an unmitigated cruise'. This is liberty. Her good is found in the calm currents of her otherwise rapids,
            and
            the tender warmth of her settled gaze and craft. Truly, she produces action which is not but rest amidst
            demand. It is simply so, that of her broader paces, that they are set and made by that settlement.
            "Where
            the treats came from the scent and flavor which our liberated being ordained; or at least fashioned us
            to be
            drawn to in the sprouts of our liberty."
            <br>&emsp;---Liberty sprouts from the soil of harmony. As life bears us down, naturally rooting us into
            the
            ground. While liberty is a result, of our actions being commiserate with such dynamics, as to overcome
            the
            pull, and without mere remedy or removal, but opposing force. Nature has given us plenty, and I am
            gratefull
            for the strenght she's given us. In fact, of good and evil, all and gained, I am truly at peace with the
            one
            who's fashioned the world: for whatever pull she's put upon us, so she gave us the lever to lift. "It's
            as
            if she knew that for us to be, life would have to be accordingly; but only fairly, were we given the
            means
            to be."

            Our aim in life is wellness, well-being and well-living. The source for this, or, more or less, means,
            is of
            pleasure, be it of the happy or sensual kind.
            <br>&emsp;Because many things can produce such, along with other effects, we say that something is good,
            in
            tha the pleasure it creates brings wellness. The end of being well-off or gluttonous, tends to have
            goods,
            or at least means, that are not so akin to the goods of well-being, and may in fact run contrary.
            <br>&emsp;We don't say that things which don't bring out well-being are bad, in that they are not fully,
            or
            at least as good as those which do. But we do make note of our ends, and how whatever is bringing out
            something besides wellness and well-being, is not effecting us in the best way. This is why being
            well-off
            is looked at as something beyond us, and not so rich and dear. Its aim is one of novelty and expensive
            delight; but nothing which is lasting or meaningfull.
            <br>&emsp;Of means then, you have those which provide a variety of pleasures. But we distinguish these
            into
            those of sense, be it of flavor and sight, or of happiness, in the sense of grace and security. Health
            for
            instance, is something we may experience during play; but it is generally something were aware of via
            understanding; and similar to all sorts of security, we may simple be pleased that we are so well, 'as
            the
            future feels bright'. But, despite enjoying the taste of certain things, you may not be happy and
            thereby
            pleased with them, due to the contradicting effect upon your health, and otherwise stable pleasure. "The
            moment of good feels outweighed by its susbquent erosion."
            <br>&emsp;When I acquire granite countertops, we tend to like the look of them. But, it seems the
            pleasure
            comes from the excitment of having them, 'as if some ecstatic delight in it's prescence': in other
            words, a
            concentrated dose of happiness, 'for how great do I feel with this being hear'. Yet, this feeling tends
            to
            whither away, and over a relatively short period of time, the care you have for their prescence is
            absent.
            No longer does it make you that happy, nor was it ever that tasty of a sight. Indeed, such a thing was a
            novelty, and is now a floating accessory. Yet, our effort for such thing was much more than this end
            would
            suggest, in worth. As such, if it brought us pleasure consisently, of sight and or ease, then we'd say
            that
            it was producing an adornment to our living. But since its pleasure more or less ceases, and soon
            --considering the mountainous effort-- then so are we fair to say, that as a good, granite is not so for
            well-being.
            <br>&emsp;The notion of being well-off may then be but a remnant of confusion; as being somewhat murky
            on
            the truth of our aims, so did we hold a spot for alternatives. Yet it seems unneccasary. There is simply
            that which creates good living, in that, as a good, its effects bear qualities to our life which we
            truly
            deem swell. "Any notion of bad seems more of a confusion of what is good; for things are merely so or
            not,
            but not something if the latter is so."
            <br>&emsp;Ultimately, what we care for are effects with certain qualities. In the case of granite, it
            produced a short experience of real good, but then died off. In the case of Kingship, it does hold
            riches;
            but you must move mountains, 'and perhaps overt your humanity' to acquire; and we thus say it is not
            that
            accessible or near. The matter of flavor is perhaps the trickiest to explain, but, we can rest on the
            fact
            that moments of pleasure, however sweet and fine, are not so encompassing to your day. Indeed, past
            pleasure
            brings with it a sort of ease, but along the lines of comfort. While appreciation is more of a drifting
            pleasure as it feels supported and or warmed by things around. This takes a natrually calm yet active
            notice. "I delight in the prescence of the moon, as it makes even my darkest moments find. But I must
            see
            it."
            <br>&emsp;Our inquiry though, into the tastes of our pleasure, needs some sort of binding. As it is in
            fact
            hard to say why chocolate and wine is not as good as veggies and water. Indeed, the balance of satiating
            pleasures with those of the happy sort, makes this easier. But so do we end up in a sort of concession,
            'as
            if we must merely be wise in avoiding that which, if constantly and without contrariety, wuold be the
            best'.
            In part this is true, for fried chicken does bring with it a sort of delight that carrots never will.
            But
            again, consider our aim in living well. This accounts for all of our life, its demands, our finer
            interests
            and all their lasting appeal. In a way, there are brambles and thicket around; and for the sake of
            argument,
            fairly. And so, as one born of the water, it pays much peace and comfort knowing their able, 'and
            actaully
            being so during the time of need'. But so, and perhaps this is the fruit of this portion, that of the
            warmer
            goods we seek, 'beyond the abasement of duty and effort, but joy and comfort', that so do these have a
            mould, a figure if you will, and as such, we can judge the quality of this statues on how well they
            stand
            together, the quality in each, 'as a dense muffine, albeit sugary and sweet, may not hold as much favor
            as a
            mountain of fruit'; too, we may consider whether the required materials take away from our sheares and
            pesticide, or, upon consumption, make is insolent and unable to such deeds. "Remarking upon the other
            statues, so can we consider them equally, in that building and (more or less) consuming one statue,
            drains
            and or mitigates the prodcution and or use of another." For the good of work, or money rather, so doth
            the
            contrariety of a hangover lay --as it quells our capacity.

            When I had my thing for Simron, I recall making a deliberate choice to not pursue, but let things carry
            out.
            This was so that things did not blow up in my face and become awkward; and, in tandum with that, I felt
            that
            the thing which we were otherwise acting on, was not so solid or true. There was merely a tenure of
            care;
            and be it from her I do not know. But, in being human, she could more or less become as inclined towards
            me.
            But my resolve was to the fact that this took time. And our trust was in the fact that if she went
            somewhere
            else, or us, that we'd be fine. "It was better to do right and fail, then more than likely attempt
            something
            and not succeed." We could more or less accomplish something; but our reservation came from the fact
            that
            besides any potential enamure between us, so didn't we care.
            <br>&emsp;I feel the same way about Amon, and now Mikala. There is this human desire, this longing for
            the
            heart. And I saw hers and now another. What I'd say, is that considering we still let things be, 'and
            live
            happily commonly, and otherwise deeply on some far end', that we proceed in ways that allow any natural
            repor to establish something at a greater pace. If were together, quibling, but with that sense of
            enamure,
            bring more to the conversation; so it is a less passing fancy and delight, but one that is deeper and
            more
            connected. The passive part is about the day, one's shift, whether their tired or not. But to bring
            more, it
            comes down to where one is from and what they like to do. Their home, family, school, interests,
            hobbies,
            delight. This is the esscence of a date; but you can simply be communal when the time is fair.
            <br>&emsp;I must note this senitment, whereby in listening to music, we feel detached from those we care
            for. The thing is, that in those moments, where song brings our stride right, we are not, more or less,
            able
            to dance with another, and otherwise care and or like them as much as our heart sings. We only wish for
            them
            to like us more, so that our candor is well-recieved.
            <br>&emsp;What I notice though, is that much of our interest comes down to sex. Or at least, that
            fashioning
            of our heart, and the extension of that into our loins. This is the sort of relational warmth and treat,
            which all other things of duty and interest are but adjoining. The truth of the matter, is that as we
            age,
            and those real matters hold precadence, that the mere interest of our heart becomes less so; and those
            other
            things must also be present. There is room to associate on more emotional levels, but the workplace is
            not
            so. And again, to bring more connection and feeling, we ought be able to associate on more substantial
            things. This is what weaves us together in the world, rather than our floating yearning.
            <br>&emsp;I mentioned statues, or figures rather, as remarkd the form of a joy and or delight. And when
            I
            listen to music, read Plutarch, or avoid even dramas and twitter, I feel ingratiated into life and the
            world
            in a certain way, 'as if my move and groove is to an according beat'. I only see though, how others are
            with
            other motions; which draws me to fret over not being near them, as to bear their attention towards me.
            "As
            there is less natural fitting for us to intertwine." And thus, I overly hope that they see me, being
            special
            in some sense, 'so that they forget their material interest, and become drawn to us in a merely
            heartfull
            manner'. The irony being, that I dont lack my interest; and so much as they live by theres, then there
            is no
            real comparability between us. And thus I merely hope that I can continue being me, while being
            emotional
            with them. "Yet this will never happen; becaue they are more than heart."

            So, we direct ourselves on the basis of work; and to some extent chores. But, of what I really need to
            set
            aside as something which is moulded around another, is gaming. For we need to eat, stretch, walk, more
            or
            less prepare. And games and what not ought surround this; not the other way around.
            <br>&emsp;I see some value in corn and tomatoe sauce, along with lighter beans. This can add protein and
            eatability. The beans may be too rought; but with the sauce and corn, we can make our grain more tasty
            and
            thus worth an extra bowl. In fact, the biggest thing is in extending our time for grain, or eating more
            during the day. I've landed on the morning veg then fruit, afternoon dried fruit, nuts, milk and
            protein. In
            a moment like this, where were off from work, have to work in the monring, and thus turn things off at
            10,
            and like finish eatin closer to 9, so am I looking for a good amount of a food, a MereFlow sesh, maybe a
            game or two of breakthrough, a little time on video making; Im gonna walk now, around dinner, and maybe
            a
            stroll around 8. Indeed, between 8 and 9 is a great food period. We've made the deliberate call that
            gaming
            before bed is poor. At least the cost of it ought not be underestimated. Our time for sleep is clear,
            but,
            gaming is similar to heavy food, in that it ought finish prior to that, leaving our last moments for
            roughage and tv.
            <br>&emsp;The insight I have regarding food is similar to exercise, that, although the kind of thing is
            important, it is more about the general practice of exercise and eating; and thus, doing these often,
            through this or that manner, is whats important. We should be eating food through the day, from kale and
            tomatoes, to an orange, milk and cranberries, to smoothies, peanuts and cucumber, to bowls of grain,
            bread
            and potato. Popcorn, crackers and spingrolls may come; but better for days like this coming Friday,
            where
            we've had our day off, and have two to come. Perfect. Exercise is equal, as is yoga, in that whats
            nearly
            required, if not best, is to do things through the day, and small as is fitting for such. We ought do
            standing rise, strolls, breif aerobics and or running, with pushups and juggling to boot; leg stretch,
            brief
            lifts, seated stretches for neck and legs, on your back, rinsing of feet and hands.

            Theres nothing like friendship, as you get one another. Love on the other hand, seems to come, perhaps
            by
            mere difference in sex, but, as such, by the motive of a comparable beat in one's heart; the remedy of
            which
            amounts to romance, relations, such love.
            <br>&emsp;This is indeed one of the dearest feelings. Of all things in the world, the tributes, or at
            least
            figures reminiscent of Aphrodite, are many's favorite.
            <br>&emsp;They are one though, at least of the bunch. And as such, our whole life is not so keen to be
            entirely focused for the sake of that. Fair belief suggests that all may find love for eachother, and
            that
            it is more about facilitating such means. Culture has come about this way as to make things more
            accessible.
            While in modern times, there is not real custom; that is, the only rule is how others communicate, and
            what
            they want is all that matters. Such communication though is a blessed curse. For those who do not know
            themselves, and are not otherwise unquestioning of who they are, then so is this open time but reminder
            of
            such: that of what we could want, we don't actually know.

            There are these fallacies, akin to heuristics, whereby you compare your life to anothers, and attribute
            something novel or different (from yours) as some mighty esteem, of which all are aware of and flaunting
            over; while you sit, alone, unseen, pathetic. This is never true; and in fact, only comes by your
            insolidity
            of your own goods ands wears.
            <br>&emsp;Of that, it seems that Mikaela, or Simron, even Bella, are an abscence to my heart, something
            which would seem so nice. I have felt this for some time, that these feelings would suffice, if all else
            was
            well, and we were pleased with only this. This sentiment of flourishing and joy, reason, grace and
            delight,
            so would something other be fine. "Akin to one esteemed by tavel, and with a friend at that"
            <br>&emsp;It is important though not to let your life get brought away, where you gaze at things, with
            desire and or envy, of all but what you have. The good is here, often I feel it. But there is actually
            alot
            which, in a finer mind, you'd see. Our boss is quite nice, as are most our collegue rather fair. I get
            along
            with Joey, Andy, Tristan, Shanoa, Alex, Kim, Tera, Teresa, Brielle, Andre, Carli, Carry, Will, Mikala.
            There
            is so much. And I don't have a great deal of friends, nor any friendship or relation. But my life
            doesn't
            swelch for that. Were in fact fine, and making a grand ado with the circumstance. Normally, I'd feel
            threathened or bethrothed to far off things, planning our commute. I recognize that what our life is
            truly
            outside those dreams and ventures is one thing. But indeed, I don't feel it is in much more than further
            tasting what we have. This past evening, seeing Baker deep in the blue, what a sight. And this notion of
            sights and security, what great sense and rigor this has instilled in me. And our remedy of rancour and
            garulity, not even the news is a bother. And that Red Cross, how it brings me to a calm exclaim.
            Perhaps, in
            truth, I don't know much. And more that certaintly am I missing a friend. But the resolve might be best
            in
            doing what you know to be missed; yoga, online dating, 'as we for a moment experience', conversing with
            people in more meaningfull ways.
            <br>&emsp;I find, as all things old and honest, that this warm motions around me are suitable amidst our
            swell of near effort. Making our yoga, working on our health, tenuring the ryhtm of work and leisure.
            All is
            fine in these regards. I just cant wait for Ark, playing Bf5 is so fine, even AOE4 is fun, along with
            Derek.

            I want an html website, scripts using jquerry.
            <br>&emsp;Simply, I want to paste in a long piece of text which is segmented into pieces --ill wrap
            these in
            appropriate divs on notepad++. Then, in such divs, I want a small button that opens an overlay/modal,
            which
            several options. These will allow me to input a title, and categories. The categories are Philo, World,
            Reflection, joy. In the top of the webpage, these categories shoudd be placed, and when I click them,
            they
            bring up the text associated with such categories. Also, at the top of each piece and its div, when I
            input
            a name via the modal, it should display that in small italic font (in said place at the top of the div).
            Of
            the categories and titles, these should be saved upon reload. I want the font of the main body of text
            to be
            centaur. Also, above the row of cateogires --near the top of the page-- there should be several square
            buttons that change the background color --and keep it after reload. Also, I will be reading through
            this
            body of text, and so if i could return to the part I was at when I closed, or after reopening, that

            Sincerely, if some girl, of any sort, 'and perhaps one who I know', came to me, and with a gratuitious
            or
            sweet end in mind, spoke to me, 'and sought, or at least bode for actions as such', I'd amend in a
            heartbead. I just wouldn't say know. And, surely, in my dreams, 'and otherwise, upon friction, doth lie
            sparks of trouble', I see us asking for something similar, and recieving commisery.
            <br>&emsp;But, I wonder if romance, or at least physical interaction, were not allowed, what would I
            seek.
            To talk and play? Well, what? What do you even know of such things, in which you'd relate. It seems you
            be
            bored.
            <br>&emsp;Then, there is this notion of fantasy, or at least rot expectation; as perhaps sprung by your
            own
            youthfull whims and confidence, or confided and provoked by others around, who exlcaim to you, 'to just
            hit
            it, or, of all these things of the sort, its easy'; to which I then feel envy and or shame, 'as if I am
            truly missing out'.
            <br>&emsp;But I see clearly that we are dealing with people.
            <br>&emsp;I look at Mikala, she smiles, asks me how I'm doing. This seems different than the average
            person.
            Normally, you get a hey, and not much else. But I am fooling myself, or letting my self be subject to
            feelings quicker then they actually reflect, to think she says this, and in such manner, because she
            likes
            you, has feelings, thinks of you, 'has you in sight, and on her mind'. The truth of the matter is that I
            want more, to not be alone, to see someone and be seen. But this does not make it so others speaking to
            you,
            as our general repor elicits, means that they are feeling something more. Were too keen to believe
            otherwise, because we want it to be so. Perhaps it means so much for her to do as she does, that my
            deeper
            wants and 'dreams' are sprung, causing exageration. For we don't actually want her, relate to her, know
            her
            even. Its just like Holly, and Simron even, where we want her to be part of our life, but not the other
            way
            around. There is not truth that says she hasn't her own life and way. Don't despair as if vanity is her
            aim,
            or motivation; for which you will pathetic be devoid from. But, the ideal, or truth, is that were
            brought
            together as people: romance and love being a part of that. "There ought be substance beneath; otherwise
            were
            children at liberty to care only for such, and have not interests or needs beneath, 'for which our love
            must
            form around'."
